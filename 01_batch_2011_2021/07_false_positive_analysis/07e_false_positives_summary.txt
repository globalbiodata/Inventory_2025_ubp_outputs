3. ENTITY EXTRACTION QUALITY:
   - 1,103 papers (58.7%) have poor entity extraction
   - Entity = "nan", "a", "c", "d", or missing
   - Suggests NER struggled with these papers

4. SETFIT CONFIDENCE:
   - Mean: 0.685 (moderate confidence)
   - Range: 0.60 - 0.73
   - NO false positives had confidence > 0.9
   - This suggests SetFit detected something "off"

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD
   - Current false positives cluster at 0.60-0.73 confidence
   - Consider requiring SetFit > 0.75 for aggressive profile
   - Or require linguistic agreement for confidence < 0.75

2. TITLE PATTERN FILTERING
   - Filter out titles with biological discovery patterns
   - "Analysis of [biology]", "Identification of [genes] in [disease]"
   - "...reveals [biological finding]"

3. ENTITY EXTRACTION QUALITY
   - 58.7% of false positives have poor entity extraction
   - Consider requiring valid entity extraction
   - Flag papers with entity = "a", "c", "d", "nan" for review

4. DATABASE KEYWORDS INSUFFICIENT
   - Many false positives mention "database" in title
   - But they're analysis tools or research databases
   - Not primary bioresource collections
   - Need more sophisticated filtering

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The aggressive profile captures many biological RESEARCH papers that
simply CITE bioresources as data sources, rather than papers ANNOUNCING
new bioresources.

These papers are doing actual biology:
  - Discovering genes/proteins/mechanisms
  - Clinical/disease research
  - Drug discovery
  - Analyzing existing data

They MENTION resources in:
  - Methods sections (data sources)
  - Introductions (citing existing tools)
  - Results (databases used for validation)

But they are NOT ABOUT introducing/describing those resources.

Filtering recommendation: More stringent criteria needed to reduce
false positive rate from 25.5% to an acceptable level (<5%).
