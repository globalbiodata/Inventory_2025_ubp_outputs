The most recent release of HMDB (version 3.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the 2009 release (version 2.0). In particular, the number of annotated metabolite entries has grown from 6500 to more than 40,000 (a 600% increase). This enormous expansion is a result of the inclusion of both 'detected' metabolites (those with measured concentrations or experimental confirmation of their existence) and 'expected' metabolites (those for which biochemical pathways are known or human intake/exposure is frequent but the compound has yet to be detected in the body). The latest release also has greatly increased the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data, the number of compounds with reference spectra and the number of data fields per entry. In addition to this expansion in data quantity, new database visualization tools and new data content have been added or enhanced. These include better spectral viewing tools, more powerful chemical substructure searches, an improved chemical taxonomy and better, more interactive pathway maps.

A two-tier access system permits clinicians and clinical scientists to maintain confidential linked anonymous records of phenotypes and CNVs for their patients that, with informed consent, can subsequently be shared with the wider clinical genetics and research communities. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are making it practical and affordable to sequence the whole exome/genome of patients who display features suggestive of a genetic disorder. This approach enables the identification of smaller intragenic mutations including single-nucleotide variants that are not accessible even with high-resolution genomic array analysis.

The interface to sequence searching has changed and the MEROPS protein sequence libraries can be searched at the EMBL-EBI with HMMER, FastA and BLASTP. Cross-references have been established between MEROPS and the PANTHER database at both the family and protein-species level, which will help to improve curation and coverage between the resources. Because of the increasing size of the MEROPS sequence collection, in future only sequences of characterized proteins, and from completely sequenced genomes of organisms of evolutionary, medical or commercial significance will be added. As an example, peptidase homologues in four proteomes from the Asgard superphylum of Archaea have been identified and compared to other archaean, bacterial and eukaryote proteomes.

The user can efficiently find functional gene relationships and design experiments to identify gene functions by reverse genetics and general molecular biology techniques. Here, we report updates to ATTED-II (version 8.0), including new and updated coexpression data and analysis tools. ATTED-II now includes eight microarray- and six RNA sequencing-based coexpression data sets for seven dicot species (Arabidopsis, field mustard, soybean, barrel medick, poplar, tomato and grape) and two monocot species (rice and maize). Stand-alone coexpression analyses tend to have low reliability. Therefore, examining evolutionarily conserved coexpression is a more effective approach from the viewpoints of reliability and evolutionary importance. In contrast, the reliability of species-specific coexpression data remains poor. Our assessment scores for individual coexpression data sets indicated that the quality of the new coexpression data sets in ATTED-II is higher than for any previous coexpression data set. In addition, five species (Arabidopsis, soybean, tomato, rice and maize) in ATTED-II are now supported by both microarray- and RNA sequencing-based coexpression data, which has increased the reliability. Consequently, ATTED-II can now provide lineage-specific coexpression information. As an example of the use of ATTED-II to explore lineage-specific coexpression, we demonstrate monocot- and dicot-specific coexpression of cell wall genes.

27888793,InverPep: A database of invertebrate antimicrobial peptides.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim of this work was to construct InverPep, a database specialised in experimentally validated antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from invertebrates.<h4>Methods</h4>AMP data contained in InverPep were manually curated from other databases and the scientific literature. MySQL was integrated with the development platform Laravel; this framework allows to integrate programming in PHP with HTML and was used to design the InverPep web page's interface. InverPep contains 18 separated fields, including InverPep code, phylum and species source, peptide name, sequence, peptide length, secondary structure, molar mass, charge, isoelectric point, hydrophobicity, Boman index, aliphatic index and percentage of hydrophobic amino acids. CALCAMPI, an algorithm to calculate the physicochemical properties of multiple peptides simultaneously, was programmed in PERL language.<h4>Results</h4>To date, InverPep contains 702 experimentally validated AMPs from invertebrate species. All of the peptides contain information associated with their source, physicochemical properties, secondary structure, biological activity and links to external literature. Most AMPs in InverPep have a length between 10 and 50 amino acids, a positive charge, a Boman index between 0 and 2 kcal/mol, and 30-50% hydrophobic amino acids.

27114492,UbiNet: an online resource for exploring the functional associations and regulatory networks of protein ubiquitylation.,"Protein ubiquitylation catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligases are crucial in the regulation of many cellular processes. Owing to the high throughput of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a number of methods have been developed for the experimental determination of ubiquitylation sites, leading to a large collection of ubiquitylation data. However, there exist no resources for the exploration of E3-ligase-associated regulatory networks of for ubiquitylated proteins in humans. Therefore, the UbiNet database was developed to provide a full investigation of protein ubiquitylation networks by incorporating experimentally verified E3 ligases, ubiquitylated substrates and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). To date, UbiNet has accumulated 43 948 experimentally verified ubiquitylation sites from 14 692 ubiquitylated proteins of humans. Additionally, we have manually curated 499 E3 ligases as well as two E1 activating and 46 E2 conjugating enzymes. To delineate the regulatory networks among E3 ligases and ubiquitylated proteins, a total of 430 530 PPIs were integrated into UbiNet for the exploration of ubiquitylation networks with an interactive network viewer. A case study demonstrated that UbiNet was able to decipher a scheme for the ubiquitylation of tumor proteins p63 and p73 that is consistent with their functions. Although the essential role of Mdm2 in p53 regulation is well studied, UbiNet revealed that Mdm2 and additional E3 ligases might be implicated in the regulation of other tumor proteins by protein ubiquitylation. Moreover, UbiNet could identify potential substrates for a specific E3 ligase based on PPIs and substrate motifs. With limited knowledge about the mechanisms through which ubiquitylated proteins are regulated by E3 ligases, UbiNet offers users an effective means for conducting preliminary analyses of protein ubiquitylation.

30016397,dbCID: a manually curated resource for exploring the driver indels in human cancer.,"While recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the creation of a multitude of databases in cancer genomic research, there is no comprehensive database focusing on the annotation of driver indels (insertions and deletions) yet. Therefore, we have developed the database of Cancer driver InDels (dbCID), which is a collection of known coding indels that likely to be engaged in cancer development, progression or therapy. dbCID contains experimentally supported and putative driver indels derived from manual curation of literature and is freely available online at http://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn:8080/dbCID. Using the data deposited in dbCID, we summarized features of driver indels in four levels (gene, DNA, transcript and protein) through comparing with putative neutral indels. We found that most of the genes containing driver indels in dbCID are known cancer genes playing a role in tumorigenesis. Contrary to the expectation, the sequences affected by driver frameshift indels are not larger than those by neutral ones. In addition, the frameshift and inframe driver indels prefer to disrupt high-conservative regions both in DNA sequences and protein domains. Finally, we developed a computational method for discriminating cancer driver from neutral frameshift indels based on the deposited data in dbCID. The proposed method outperformed other widely used non-cancer-specific predictors on an external test set, which demonstrated the usefulness of the data deposited in dbCID.

23794735,The CARLSBAD database: a confederated database of chemical bioactivities.,"Many bioactivity databases offer information regarding the biological activity of small molecules on protein targets. Information in these databases is often hard to resolve with certainty because of subsetting different data in a variety of formats; use of different bioactivity metrics; use of different identifiers for chemicals and proteins; and having to access different query interfaces, respectively. Given the multitude of data sources, interfaces and standards, it is challenging to gather relevant facts and make appropriate connections and decisions regarding chemical-protein associations. The CARLSBAD database has been developed as an integrated resource, focused on high-quality subsets from several bioactivity databases, which are aggregated and presented in a uniform manner, suitable for the study of the relationships between small molecules and targets. In contrast to data collection resources, CARLSBAD provides a single normalized activity value of a given type for each unique chemical-protein target pair. Two types of scaffold perception methods have been implemented and are available for datamining: HierS (hierarchical scaffolds) and MCES (maximum common edge subgraph). The 2012 release of CARLSBAD contains 439 985 unique chemical structures, mapped onto 1,420 889 unique bioactivities, and annotated with 277 140 HierS scaffolds and 54 135 MCES chemical patterns, respectively. Of the 890 323 unique structure-target pairs curated in CARLSBAD, 13.95% are aggregated from multiple structure-target values: 94 975 are aggregated from two bioactivities, 14 544 from three, 7 930 from four and 2214 have five bioactivities, respectively. CARLSBAD captures bioactivities and tags for 1435 unique chemical structures of active pharmaceutical ingredients (i.e. 'drugs'). CARLSBAD processing resulted in a net 17.3% data reduction for chemicals, 34.3% reduction for bioactivities, 23% reduction for HierS and 25% reduction for MCES, respectively.

30841849,"mGAP: the macaque genotype and phenotype resource, a framework for accessing and interpreting macaque variant data, and identifying new models of human disease.","<h4>Background</h4>Non-human primates (NHPs), particularly macaques, serve as critical and highly relevant pre-clinical models of human disease. The similarity in human and macaque natural disease susceptibility, along with parallel genetic risk alleles, underscores the value of macaques in the development of effective treatment strategies. Nonetheless, there are limited genomic resources available to support the exploration and discovery of macaque models of inherited disease. Notably, there are few public databases tailored to searching NHP sequence variants, and no other database making use of centralized variant calling, or providing genotype-level data and predicted pathogenic effects for each variant.<h4>Results</h4>The macaque Genotype And Phenotype (mGAP) resource is the first public website providing searchable, annotated macaque variant data. The mGAP resource includes a catalog of high confidence variants, derived from whole genome sequence (WGS). The current mGAP release at time of publication (1.7) contains 17,087,212 variants based on the sequence analysis of 293 rhesus macaques. A custom pipeline was developed to enable annotation of the macaque variants, leveraging human data sources that include regulatory elements (ENCODE, RegulomeDB), known disease- or phenotype-associated variants (GRASP), predicted impact (SIFT, PolyPhen2), and sequence conservation (Phylop, PhastCons). Currently mGAP includes 2767 variants that are identical to alleles listed in the human ClinVar database, of which 276 variants, spanning 258 genes, are identified as pathogenic. An additional 12,472 variants are predicted as high impact (SnpEff) and 13,129 are predicted as damaging (PolyPhen2). In total, these variants are predicted to be associated with more than 2000 human disease or phenotype entries reported in OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). Importantly, mGAP also provides genotype-level data for all subjects, allowing identification of specific individuals harboring alleles of interest.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mGAP resource provides variant and genotype data from hundreds of rhesus macaques, processed in a consistent manner across all subjects ( https://mgap.ohsu.edu ).

31269035,Using citizen science to expand the global map of landslides: Introducing the Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR).,"Robust inventories are vital for improving assessment of and response to deadly and costly landslide hazards. However, collecting landslide events in inventories is difficult at the global scale due to inconsistencies in or the absence of landslide reporting. Citizen science is a valuable opportunity for addressing some of these challenges. The new Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR) supplements data in a NASA-developed Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) with citizen science reports to build a more robust, publicly available global inventory. This manuscript introduces the COOLR project and its methods, evaluates the initial citizen science results from the first 13 months, and discusses future improvements to increase the global engagement with the project. The COOLR project (https://landslides.nasa.gov) contains Landslide Reporter, the first global citizen science project for landslides, and Landslide Viewer, a portal to visualize data from COOLR and other satellite and model products. From March 2018 to April 2019, 49 citizen scientists contributed 162 new landslide events to COOLR. These events spanned 37 countries in five continents. The initial results demonstrated that both expert and novice participants are contributing via Landslide Reporter. Citizen scientists are filling in data gaps through news sources in 11 different languages, in-person observations, and new landslide events occurring hundreds and thousands of kilometers away from any existing GLC data. The data is of sufficient accuracy to use in NASA susceptibility and hazard models.

To maintain a high data quality, successive filters are applied to automatically validate the NRP annotations and only validated data is inserted in the database. External databases were also used to complete annotations of NRPs already in Norine. Besides, annotation consistency inside Norine and between Norine and external sources have reported annotation errors. Some can be corrected automatically, while others need manual curation. This new approach led to the insertion of 539 new NRPs and the addition or correction of annotations of nearly all Norine entries.

32367112,MACSNVdb: a high-quality SNV database for interspecies genetic divergence investigation among macaques.,"Macaques are the most widely used non-human primates in biomedical research. The genetic divergence between these animal models is responsible for their phenotypic differences in response to certain diseases. However, the macaque single nucleotide polymorphism resources mainly focused on rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), which hinders the broad research and biomedical application of other macaques. In order to overcome these limitations, we constructed a database named MACSNVdb that focuses on the interspecies genetic diversity among macaque genomes. MACSNVdb is a web-enabled database comprising ~74.51 million high-quality non-redundant single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified among 20 macaque individuals from six species groups (muttla, fascicularis, sinica, arctoides, silenus, sylvanus). In addition to individual SNVs, MACSNVdb also allows users to browse and retrieve groups of user-defined SNVs. In particular, users can retrieve non-synonymous SNVs that may have deleterious effects on protein structure or function within macaque orthologs of human disease and drug-target genes. Besides position, alleles and flanking sequences, MACSNVdb integrated additional genomic information including SNV annotations and gene functional annotations. MACSNVdb will facilitate biomedical researchers to discover molecular mechanisms of diverse responses to diseases as well as primatologist to perform population genetic studies.

As a result of this update, PrimerBank contains 497,156 primers (an increase of 62% from the previous version) that cover 36,928 human and mouse genes, corresponding to around 94% of all known protein-coding gene sequences. An updated algorithm based on our previous approach was used to design new primers using current genomic information available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). PrimerBank primers work under uniform PCR conditions, and can be used for high-throughput or genome-wide qPCR. Because of their broader linear dynamic range and greater sensitivity, qPCR approaches are used to reanalyze changes in expression suggested by exploratory technologies such as microarrays and RNA-Seq.

Currently, MAHMI database contains over 300 hundred million peptide entries, with detailed information about peptide sequence, sources and potential bioactivity. The reference peptide data section is curated manually by domain experts. The in silico peptide data section is populated automatically through the systematic processing of publicly available exoproteomes of the human microbiome. Bioactivity prediction is based on the global alignment of the automatically processed peptides with experimentally validated immunomodulatory and antiproliferative peptides, in the reference section. MAHMI provides researchers with a comparative tool for inspecting the potential immunomodulatory or antiproliferative bioactivity of new amino acidic sequences and identifying promising peptides to be further investigated. Moreover, researchers are welcome to submit new experimental evidence on peptide bioactivity, namely, empiric and structural data, as a proactive, expert means to keep the database updated and improve the implemented bioactivity prediction method. Bioactive peptides identified by MAHMI have a huge biotechnological potential, including the manipulation of aberrant immune responses and the design of new functional ingredients/foods based on the genetic sequences of the human microbiome.

In this article, we highlight recent efforts to improve the availability and accessibility of the disease model information in FlyBase (http://flybase.org), the model organism database for Drosophila. FlyBase has recently introduced Human Disease Model Reports, each of which presents background information on a specific disease, a tabulation of related disease subtypes, and summaries of experimental data and results using fruit flies. Integrated presentations of relevant data and reagents described in other sections of FlyBase are incorporated into these reports, which are specifically designed to be accessible to non-fly researchers in order to promote collaboration across model organism communities working in translational science. Another key component of disease model information in FlyBase is that data are collected in a consistent format --- using the evolving Disease Ontology (an open-source standardized ontology for human-disease-associated biomedical data) - to allow robust and intuitive searches. To facilitate this, FlyBase has developed a dedicated tool for querying and navigating relevant data, which include mutations that model a disease and any associated interacting modifiers.

25468931,"AromaDeg, a novel database for phylogenomics of aerobic bacterial degradation of aromatics.","Understanding prokaryotic transformation of recalcitrant pollutants and the in-situ metabolic nets require the integration of massive amounts of biological data. Decades of biochemical studies together with novel next-generation sequencing data have exponentially increased information on aerobic aromatic degradation pathways. However, the majority of protein sequences in public databases have not been experimentally characterized and homology-based methods are still the most routinely used approach to assign protein function, allowing the propagation of misannotations. AromaDeg is a web-based resource targeting aerobic degradation of aromatics that comprises recently updated (September 2013) and manually curated databases constructed based on a phylogenomic approach. Grounded in phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences of key catabolic protein families and of proteins of documented function, AromaDeg allows query and data mining of novel genomic, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data sets. Essentially, each query sequence that match a given protein family of AromaDeg is associated to a specific cluster of a given phylogenetic tree and further function annotation and/or substrate specificity may be inferred from the neighboring cluster members with experimentally validated function. This allows a detailed characterization of individual protein superfamilies as well as high-throughput functional classifications. Thus, AromaDeg addresses the deficiencies of homology-based protein function prediction, combining phylogenetic tree construction and integration of experimental data to obtain more accurate annotations of new biological data related to aerobic aromatic biodegradation pathways. We pursue in future the expansion of AromaDeg to other enzyme families involved in aromatic degradation and its regular update.

Establishing interactions between protein and biologically relevant ligands is an important step toward understanding the protein functions. Most ligand-binding sites prediction methods use the protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates. However, not all ligands present in the PDB are biologically relevant, as small molecules are often used as additives for solving the protein structures. To facilitate template-based ligand-protein docking, virtual ligand screening and protein function annotations, we develop a hierarchical procedure for assessing the biological relevance of ligands present in the PDB structures, which involves a four-step biological feature filtering followed by careful manual verifications. This procedure is used for BioLiP construction. Each entry in BioLiP contains annotations on: ligand-binding residues, ligand-binding affinity, catalytic sites, Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms and cross-links to the other databases. In addition, to facilitate the use of BioLiP for function annotation of uncharacterized proteins, a new consensus-based algorithm COACH is developed to predict ligand-binding sites from protein sequence or using 3D structure.

These identified arsenic-related genes are valuable information for studying arsenic toxicity. However, the literature about these identified arsenic-related genes is widely dispersed and cannot be easily acquired by researchers.

30893420,AYbRAH: a curated ortholog database for yeasts and fungi spanning 600 million years of evolution.,"Budding yeasts inhabit a range of environments by exploiting various metabolic traits. The genetic bases for these traits are mostly unknown, preventing their addition or removal in a chassis organism for metabolic engineering. Insight into the evolution of orthologs, paralogs and xenologs in the yeast pan-genome can help bridge these genotypes; however, existing phylogenomic databases do not span diverse yeasts, and sometimes cannot distinguish between these homologs. To help understand the molecular evolution of these traits in yeasts, we created Analyzing Yeasts by Reconstructing Ancestry of Homologs (AYbRAH), an open-source database of predicted and manually curated ortholog groups for 33 diverse fungi and yeasts in Dikarya, spanning 600 million years of evolution. OrthoMCL and OrthoDB were used to cluster protein sequence into ortholog and homolog groups, respectively; MAFFT and PhyML reconstructed the phylogeny of all homolog groups. Ortholog assignments for enzymes and small metabolite transporters were compared to their phylogenetic reconstruction, and curated to resolve any discrepancies. Information on homolog and ortholog groups can be viewed in the AYbRAH web portal (https://lmse.github.io/aybrah/), including functional annotations, predictions for mitochondrial localization and transmembrane domains, literature references and phylogenetic reconstructions. Ortholog assignments in AYbRAH were compared to HOGENOM, KEGG Orthology, OMA, eggNOG and PANTHER. PANTHER and OMA had the most congruent ortholog groups with AYbRAH, while the other phylogenomic databases had greater amounts of under-clustering, over-clustering or no ortholog annotations for proteins.

25931458,NeuroPep: a comprehensive resource of neuropeptides.,"Neuropeptides play a variety of roles in many physiological processes and serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of some nervous-system disorders. In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of identified neuropeptides. Therefore, we have developed NeuroPep, a comprehensive resource of neuropeptides, which holds 5949 non-redundant neuropeptide entries originating from 493 organisms belonging to 65 neuropeptide families. In NeuroPep, the number of neuropeptides in invertebrates and vertebrates is 3455 and 2406, respectively. It is currently the most complete neuropeptide database. We extracted entries deposited in UniProt, the database (www.neuropeptides.nl) and NeuroPedia, and used text mining methods to retrieve entries from the MEDLINE abstracts and full text articles. All the entries in NeuroPep have been manually checked. 2069 of the 5949 (35%) neuropeptide sequences were collected from the scientific literature. Moreover, NeuroPep contains detailed annotations for each entry, including source organisms, tissue specificity, families, names, post-translational modifications, 3D structures (if available) and literature references. Information derived from these peptide sequences such as amino acid compositions, isoelectric points, molecular weight and other physicochemical properties of peptides are also provided. A quick search feature allows users to search the database with keywords such as sequence, name, family, etc., and an advanced search page helps users to combine queries with logical operators like AND/OR. In addition, user-friendly web tools like browsing, sequence alignment and mapping are also integrated into the NeuroPep database.

24007337,GRASP [Genomic Resource Access for Stoichioproteomics]: comparative explorations of the atomic content of 12 Drosophila proteomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>""Stoichioproteomics"" relates the elemental composition of proteins and proteomes to variation in the physiological and ecological environment. To help harness and explore the wealth of hypotheses made possible under this framework, we introduce GRASP (http://www.graspdb.net), a public bioinformatic knowledgebase containing information on the frequencies of 20 amino acids and atomic composition of their side chains. GRASP integrates comparative protein composition data with annotation data from multiple public databases. Currently, GRASP includes information on proteins of 12 sequenced Drosophila (fruit fly) proteomes, which will be expanded to include increasingly diverse organisms over time. In this paper we illustrate the potential of GRASP for testing stoichioproteomic hypotheses by conducting an exploratory investigation into the composition of 12 Drosophila proteomes, testing the prediction that protein atomic content is associated with species ecology and with protein expression levels.<h4>Results</h4>Elements varied predictably along multivariate axes. Species were broadly similar, with the D. willistoni proteome a clear outlier. As expected, individual protein atomic content within proteomes was influenced by protein function and amino acid biochemistry. Evolution in elemental composition across the phylogeny followed less predictable patterns, but was associated with broad ecological variation in diet. Using expression data available for D. melanogaster, we found evidence consistent with selection for efficient usage of elements within the proteome: as expected, nitrogen content was reduced in highly expressed proteins in most tissues, most strongly in the gut, where nutrients are assimilated, and least strongly in the germline.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The patterns identified here using GRASP provide a foundation on which to base future research into the evolution of atomic composition in Drosophila and other taxa.",False,True,,0.7160359,,grasp,30.99851197,ok,,genomic resource access for stoichioproteomics,,spacy+v2,0.99851197,GRASP [Genomic Resource Access for Stoichioproteomics],True,False,False,GRASP,http://www.graspdb.net,http://www.graspdb.net,True,"...ossible under this framework, we introduce GRASP (http://www.graspdb.net), a public bioinformatic knowledgebase containing...",1,True,True,True
24030781,IQdb: an intelligence quotient score-associated gene resource for human intelligence.,"Intelligence quotient (IQ) is the most widely used phenotype to characterize human cognitive abilities. Recent advances in studies on human intelligence have identified many new susceptibility genes. However, the genetic mechanisms involved in IQ score and the relationship between IQ score and the risk of mental disorders have won little attention. To address the genetic complexity of IQ score, we have developed IQdb (http://IQdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn), a publicly available database for exploring IQ-associated human genes. In total, we collected 158 experimental verified genes from literature as a core dataset in IQdb. In addition, 46 genomic regions related to IQ score have been curated from literature. Based on the core dataset and 46 confirmed linked genomic regions, more than 6932 potential IQ-related genes are expanded using data of protein-protein interactions. A systematic gene ranking approach was applied to all the collected and expanded genes to represent the relative importance of all the 7090 genes in IQdb. Our further systematic pathway analysis reveals that IQ-associated genes are significantly enriched in multiple signal events, especially related to cognitive systems. Of the 158 genes in the core dataset, 81 are involved in various psychotic and mental disorders. This comprehensive gene resource illustrates the importance of IQdb to our understanding on human intelligence, and highlights the utility of IQdb for elucidating the functions of IQ-associated genes and the cross-talk mechanisms among cognition-related pathways in some mental disorders for community.

29774137,Saudi anti-human cancer plants database (SACPD): A collection of plants with anti-human cancer activities.,"Several anticancer drugs have been developed from natural products such as plants. Successful experiments in inhibiting the growth of human cancer cell lines using Saudi plants were published over the last three decades. Up to date, there is no Saudi anticancer plants database as a comprehensive source for the interesting data generated from these experiments. Therefore, there was a need for creating a database to collect, organize, search and retrieve such data. As a result, the current paper describes the generation of the <i>Saudi anti-human cancer plants database</i> (SACPD). The database contains most of the reported information about the naturally growing Saudi anticancer plants. SACPD comprises the scientific and local names of 91 plant species that grow naturally in Saudi Arabia. These species belong to 38 different taxonomic families. In Addition, 18 species that represent16 family of medicinal plants and are intensively sold in the local markets in Saudi Arabia were added to the database. The website provides interesting details, including plant part containing the anticancer bioactive compounds, plants locations and cancer/cell type against which they exhibit their anticancer activity. Our survey revealed that breast, liver and leukemia were the most studied cancer cell lines in Saudi Arabia with percentages of 27%, 19% and 15%, respectively. The current SACPD represents a nucleus around which more development efforts can expand to accommodate all future submissions about new Saudi plant species with anticancer activities.

The WallProtDB database has been designed as a tool to facilitate the inventory, the interpretation of cell wall proteomics data and the comparisons between cell wall proteomes.<h4>Results</h4>WallProtDB (http://www.polebio.lrsv.ups-tlse.fr/WallProtDB/) presently contains 2170 proteins and ESTs identified experimentally in 36 cell wall proteomics studies performed on 11 different plant species. Two criteria have to be met for entering WallProtDB. First one is related to the identification of proteins. Only proteins identified in plant with available genomic or ESTs data are considered to ensure unambiguous identification. Second criterion is related to the difficulty to obtain clean cell wall fractions. Indeed, since cell walls constitute an open compartment difficult to isolate, numerous proteins predicted to be intracellular and/or having functions inside the cell have been identified in cell wall extracts. Then, except proteins predicted to be plasma membrane proteins, only proteins having a predicted signal peptide and no known intracellular retention signal are included in the database. In addition, WallProtDB contains information about the strategies used to obtain cell wall protein extracts and to identify proteins by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Mass spectrometry data are included when available.

26424082,RegNetwork: an integrated database of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory networks in human and mouse.,"Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is of fundamental importance to numerous biological processes. Nowadays, an increasing amount of gene regulatory relationships have been documented in various databases and literature. However, to more efficiently exploit such knowledge for biomedical research and applications, it is necessary to construct a genome-wide regulatory network database to integrate the information on gene regulatory relationships that are widely scattered in many different places. Therefore, in this work, we build a knowledge-based database, named 'RegNetwork', of gene regulatory networks for human and mouse by collecting and integrating the documented regulatory interactions among transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and target genes from 25 selected databases. Moreover, we also inferred and incorporated potential regulatory relationships based on transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs into RegNetwork. As a result, RegNetwork contains a comprehensive set of experimentally observed or predicted transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory relationships, and the database framework is flexibly designed for potential extensions to include gene regulatory networks for other organisms in the future. Based on RegNetwork, we characterized the statistical and topological properties of genome-wide regulatory networks for human and mouse, we also extracted and interpreted simple yet important network motifs that involve the interplays between TF-miRNA and their targets. In summary, RegNetwork provides an integrated resource on the prior information for gene regulatory relationships, and it enables us to further investigate context-specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory interactions based on domain-specific experimental data.

24175918,RegPrecise 3.0--a resource for genome-scale exploration of transcriptional regulation in bacteria.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genome-scale prediction of gene regulation and reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in prokaryotes is one of the critical tasks of modern genomics. Bacteria from different taxonomic groups, whose lifestyles and natural environments are substantially different, possess highly diverged transcriptional regulatory networks. The comparative genomics approaches are useful for in silico reconstruction of bacterial regulons and networks operated by both transcription factors (TFs) and RNA regulatory elements (riboswitches).<h4>Description</h4>RegPrecise (http://regprecise.lbl.gov) is a web resource for collection, visualization and analysis of transcriptional regulons reconstructed by comparative genomics. We significantly expanded a reference collection of manually curated regulons we introduced earlier. RegPrecise 3.0 provides access to inferred regulatory interactions organized by phylogenetic, structural and functional properties. Taxonomy-specific collections include 781 TF regulogs inferred in more than 160 genomes representing 14 taxonomic groups of Bacteria. TF-specific collections include regulogs for a selected subset of 40 TFs reconstructed across more than 30 taxonomic lineages. Novel collections of regulons operated by RNA regulatory elements (riboswitches) include near 400 regulogs inferred in 24 bacterial lineages. RegPrecise 3.0 provides four classifications of the reference regulons implemented as controlled vocabularies: 55 TF protein families; 43 RNA motif families; ~150 biological processes or metabolic pathways; and ~200 effectors or environmental signals. Genome-wide visualization of regulatory networks and metabolic pathways covered by the reference regulons are available for all studied genomes. A separate section of RegPrecise 3.0 contains draft regulatory networks in 640 genomes obtained by an conservative propagation of the reference regulons to closely related genomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RegPrecise 3.0 gives access to the transcriptional regulons reconstructed in bacterial genomes. Analytical capabilities include exploration of: regulon content, structure and function; TF binding site motifs; conservation and variations in genome-wide regulatory networks across all taxonomic groups of Bacteria. RegPrecise 3.0 was selected as a core resource on transcriptional regulation of the Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase, an emerging software and data environment designed to enable researchers to collaboratively generate, test and share new hypotheses about gene and protein functions, perform large-scale analyses, and model interactions in microbes, plants, and their communities.",False,True,,0.7190432,regprecise,,30.9844494,ok,,prokaryotes | egprecise,,spacy+v2,0.9844494,,True,False,False,RegPrecise,http://regprecise.lbl.gov,http://regprecise.lbl.gov,True,"...ts (riboswitches).<h4>Description</h4>RegPrecise (http://regprecise.lbl.gov) is a web resource for collection, visualization...",1,False,True,True

23448274,PASmiR: a literature-curated database for miRNA molecular regulation in plant response to abiotic stress.,"<h4>Background</h4>Over 200 published studies of more than 30 plant species have reported a role for miRNAs in regulating responses to abiotic stresses. However, data from these individual reports has not been collected into a single database. The lack of a curated database of stress-related miRNAs limits research in this field, and thus a cohesive database system should necessarily be constructed for data deposit and further application.<h4>Description</h4>PASmiR, a literature-curated and web-accessible database, was developed to provide detailed, searchable descriptions of miRNA molecular regulation in different plant abiotic stresses. PASmiR currently includes data from ~200 published studies, representing 1038 regulatory relationships between 682 miRNAs and 35 abiotic stresses in 33 plant species. PASmiR's interface allows users to retrieve miRNA-stress regulatory entries by keyword search using plant species, abiotic stress, and miRNA identifier. Each entry upon keyword query contains detailed regulation information for a specific miRNA, including species name, miRNA identifier, stress name, miRNA expression pattern, detection method for miRNA expression, a reference literature, and target gene(s) of the miRNA extracted from the corresponding reference or miRBase. Users can also contribute novel regulatory entries by using a web-based submission page.

With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, uncovering cellular heterogeneity of different tissues for different diseases has become feasible by profiling transcriptomes across cell types at the cellular level. In particular, comparing gene expression profiles between different cell types and identifying cell-type-specific genes in various diseases offers new possibilities to address biological and medical questions. However, systematic, hierarchical and vast databases of gene expression profiles in human diseases at the cellular level are lacking. Thus, we reviewed the literature prior to March 2020 for studies which used scRNA-seq to study diseases with human samples, and developed the SC2disease database to summarize all the data by different diseases, tissues and cell types. SC2disease documents 946 481 entries, corresponding to 341 cell types, 29 tissues and 25 diseases. Each entry in the SC2disease database contains comparisons of differentially expressed genes between different cell types, tissues and disease-related health status. Furthermore, we reanalyzed gene expression matrix by unified pipeline to improve the comparability between different studies.

While past literature has utilized a variety of methods to identify ADP-ribosylated proteins, recent proteomics studies bring the power of mass spectrometry to determine sites of the modification. To appreciate the diverse roles of ADP-ribosylation across the proteome, we have created ADPriboDB - a database of ADP-ribosylated proteins (http://ADPriboDB.leunglab.org). Each entry of ADPriboDB is annotated manually by at least two independent curators from the literature between January 1975 and July 2015.

26644461,ALCOdb: Gene Coexpression Database for Microalgae.,"In the era of energy and food shortage, microalgae have gained much attention as promising sources of biofuels and food ingredients. However, only a small fraction of microalgal genes have been functionally characterized. Here, we have developed the Algae Gene Coexpression database (ALCOdb; http://alcodb.jp), which provides gene coexpression information to survey gene modules for a function of interest. ALCOdb currently supports two model algae: the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Users can retrieve coexpression information for genes of interest through three unique data pages: (i) Coexpressed Gene List; (ii) Gene Information; and (iii) Coexpressed Gene Network.

31725861,PCOSBase: a manually curated database of polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the main causes of infertility and affects 5-20% women of reproductive age. Despite the increased prevalence of PCOS, the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology remains unclear. The expansion of omics on studying the mechanisms of PCOS has lead into vast amounts of proteins related to PCOS resulting to a challenge in collating and depositing this deluge of data into one place. A knowledge-based repository named as PCOSBase was developed to systematically store all proteins related to PCOS. These proteins were compiled from various online databases and published expression studies. Rigorous criteria were developed to identify those that were highly related to PCOS. They were manually curated and analysed to provide additional information on gene ontologies, pathways, domains, tissue localizations and diseases that associate with PCOS. Other proteins that might interact with PCOS-related proteins identified from this study were also included. Currently, 8185 PCOS-related proteins were identified and assigned to 13 237 gene ontology vocabulary, 1004 pathways, 7936 domains, 29 disease classes, 1928 diseases, 91 tissues and 320 472 interactions. All publications related to PCOS are also indexed in PCOSBase. Data entries are searchable in the main page, search, browse and datasets tabs. Protein advanced search is provided to search for specific proteins. To date, PCOSBase has the largest collection of PCOS-related proteins.

27800578,SCEGRAM: An image database for semantic and syntactic inconsistencies in scenes.,"Our visual environment is not random, but follows compositional rules according to what objects are usually found where. Despite the growing interest in how such semantic and syntactic rules - a scene grammar - enable effective attentional guidance and object perception, no common image database containing highly-controlled object-scene modifications has been publically available. Such a database is essential in minimizing the risk that low-level features drive high-level effects of interest, which is being discussed as possible source of controversial study results. To generate the first database of this kind - SCEGRAM - we took photographs of 62 real-world indoor scenes in six consistency conditions that contain semantic and syntactic (both mild and extreme) violations as well as their combinations. Importantly, always two scenes were paired, so that an object was semantically consistent in one scene (e.g., ketchup in kitchen) and inconsistent in the other (e.g., ketchup in bathroom). Low-level salience did not differ between object-scene conditions and was generally moderate. Additionally, SCEGRAM contains consistency ratings for every object-scene condition, as well as object-absent scenes and object-only images. Finally, a cross-validation using eye-movements replicated previous results of longer dwell times for both semantic and syntactic inconsistencies compared to consistent controls. In sum, the SCEGRAM image database is the first to contain well-controlled semantic and syntactic object-scene inconsistencies that can be used in a broad range of cognitive paradigms (e.g., verbal and pictorial priming, change detection, object identification, etc.) including paradigms addressing developmental aspects of scene grammar.

Intrinsic radiosensitivity is an important factor underlying the radiotherapeutic efficacy of this precise treatment. During the past decades, great efforts have been made to improve radiotherapy treatment through multiple strategies. However, invaluable data remains buried in the extensive radiotherapy literature, making it difficult to obtain an overall view of the detailed mechanisms leading to radiosensitivity, thus limiting advances in radiotherapy. To address this issue, we collected data from the relevant literature contained in the PubMed database and developed a literature-based database that we term the cancer radiosensitivity regulation factors database (dbCRSR). dbCRSR is a manually curated catalogue of radiosensitivity, containing multiple radiosensitivity regulation factors (395 coding genes, 119 non-coding RNAs and 306 chemical compounds) with appropriate annotation. To illustrate the value of the data we collected, data mining was performed including functional annotation and network analysis. In summary, dbCRSR is the first literature-based database to focus on radiosensitivity and provides a resource to better understand the detailed mechanisms of radiosensitivity.

Owing to the importance of RBPs in gene regulation, a great number of studies have been conducted, resulting in a large amount of RNA-Seq datasets. However, these datasets usually do not have structured organization of metadata, which limits their potentially wide use. To bridge this gap, the metadata of a comprehensive set of publicly available mouse RNA-Seq datasets with perturbed RBPs were collected and integrated into a database called RBPMetaDB. This database contains 292 mouse RNA-Seq datasets for a comprehensive list of 187 RBPs. These RBPs account for only ∼10% of all known RBPs annotated in Gene Ontology, indicating that most are still unexplored using high-throughput sequencing. This negative information provides a great pool of candidate RBPs for biologists to conduct future experimental studies. In addition, we found that DNA-binding activities are significantly enriched among RBPs in RBPMetaDB, suggesting that prior studies of these DNA- and RNA-binding factors focus more on DNA-binding activities instead of RNA-binding activities. This result reveals the opportunity to efficiently reuse these data for investigation of the roles of their RNA-binding activities.

24700709,The Developmental Brain Disorders Database (DBDB): a curated neurogenetics knowledge base with clinical and research applications.,"The number of single genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders has increased dramatically over the past decade. The identification of causative genes for these disorders is important to clinical outcome as it allows for accurate assessment of prognosis, genetic counseling, delineation of natural history, inclusion in clinical trials, and in some cases determines therapy. Clinicians face the challenge of correctly identifying neurodevelopmental phenotypes, recognizing syndromes, and prioritizing the best candidate genes for testing. However, there is no central repository of definitions for many phenotypes, leading to errors of diagnosis. Additionally, there is no system of levels of evidence linking genes to phenotypes, making it difficult for clinicians to know which genes are most strongly associated with a given condition. We have developed the Developmental Brain Disorders Database (DBDB: https://www.dbdb.urmc.rochester.edu/home), a publicly available, online-curated repository of genes, phenotypes, and syndromes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. DBDB contains the first referenced ontology of developmental brain phenotypes, and uses a novel system of levels of evidence for gene-phenotype associations. It is intended to assist clinicians in arriving at the correct diagnosis, select the most appropriate genetic test for that phenotype, and improve the care of patients with developmental brain disorders. For researchers interested in the discovery of novel genes for developmental brain disorders, DBDB provides a well-curated source of important genes against which research sequencing results can be compared.

32679723,Comparative Assessment of Protein Kinase Inhibitors in Public Databases and in PKIDB.,"Since the first approval of a protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001, 55 new PKIs have reached the market, and many inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This is a clear indication that protein kinases still represent major drug targets for the pharmaceutical industry. In a previous work, we have introduced PKIDB, a publicly available database, gathering PKIs that have already been approved (Phase 4), as well as those currently in clinical trials (Phases 0 to 3). This database is updated frequently, and an analysis of the new data is presented here. In addition, we compared the set of PKIs present in PKIDB with the PKIs in early preclinical studies found in ChEMBL, the largest publicly available chemical database. For each dataset, the distribution of physicochemical descriptors related to drug-likeness is presented. From these results, updated guidelines to prioritize compounds for targeting protein kinases are proposed. The results of a principal component analysis (PCA) show that the PKIDB dataset is fully encompassed within all PKIs found in the public database. This observation is reinforced by a principal moments of inertia (PMI) analysis of all molecules. Interestingly, we notice that PKIs in clinical trials tend to explore new 3D chemical space. While a great majority of PKIs is located on the area of ""flatland"", we find few compounds exploring the 3D structural space. Finally, a scaffold diversity analysis of the two datasets, based on frequency counts was performed. The results give insight into the chemical space of PKIs, and can guide researchers to reach out new unexplored areas.

The TIA pathway operates in a complex metabolic network that steers plant growth and survival. Pathway databases and metabolic networks reconstructed from 'omics' sequence data can help to discover missing enzymes, study metabolic pathway evolution and, ultimately, engineer metabolic pathways. To date, such databases have mainly been built for model plant species with sequenced genomes. Although genome sequence data are not available for most medicinal plant species, next-generation sequencing is now extensively employed to create comprehensive medicinal plant transcriptome sequence resources. Here we report on the construction of CathaCyc, a detailed metabolic pathway database, from C. roseus RNA-Seq data sets. CathaCyc (version 1.0) contains 390 pathways with 1,347 assigned enzymes and spans primary and secondary metabolism. Curation of the pathways linked with the synthesis of TIAs and triterpenoids, their primary metabolic precursors, and their elicitors, the jasmonate hormones, demonstrated that RNA-Seq resources are suitable for the construction of pathway databases. CathaCyc is accessible online (http://www.cathacyc.org) and offers a range of tools for the visualization and analysis of metabolic networks and 'omics' data. Overlay with expression data from publicly available RNA-Seq resources demonstrated that two well-characterized C. roseus terpenoid pathways, those of TIAs and triterpenoids, are subject to distinct regulation by both developmental and environmental cues.

EPD primarily serves biologists interested in analysing the motif content, chromatin structure or DNA methylation status of co-regulated promoter subsets. Initially, promoter evidence came from TSS mapping experiments targeted at single genes and published in journal articles. Today, the TSS positions provided by EPD are inferred from next-generation sequencing data distributed in electronic form. Traditionally, EPD has been a high-quality database with low coverage. The focus of recent efforts has been to reach complete gene coverage for important model organisms.

It has now been adopted to study a wide range of biological questions, including various developmental processes (in particular root, symbiotic nodule and seed development), symbiotic (nitrogen-fixing and arbuscular mycorrhizal endosymbioses) and pathogenic interactions, as well as responses to abiotic stress. With a number of tools and resources set up in M. truncatula for omics, genetics and reverse genetics approaches, massive amounts of data have been produced, as well as four genome sequence releases. Many of these data were generated with heterogeneous tools, notably for transcriptomics studies, and are consequently difficult to integrate. This issue is addressed by the LeGOO (for Legume Graph-Oriented Organizer) knowledge base (https://www.legoo.org), which finds the correspondence between the multiple identifiers of the same gene. Furthermore, an important goal of LeGOO is to collect and represent biological information from peer-reviewed publications, whatever the technical approaches used to obtain this information. The information is modeled in a graph-oriented database, which enables flexible representation, with currently over 200,000 relations retrieved from 298 publications. LeGOO also provides the user with mining tools, including links to the Mt5.0 genome browser and associated information (on gene functional annotation, expression, methylome, natural diversity and available insertion mutants), as well as tools to navigate through different model species.

30985146,ProteinExplorer: A Repository-Scale Resource for Exploration of Protein Detection in Public Mass Spectrometry Data Sets.,"High-throughput tandem mass spectrometry has enabled the detection and identification of over 75% of all proteins predicted to result in translated gene products in the human genome. In fact, the galloping rate of data acquisition and sharing of mass spectrometry data has led to the current availability of many tens of terabytes of public data in thousands of human data sets. The systematic reanalysis of these public data sets has been used to build a community-scale spectral library of 2.1 million precursors for over 1 million unique sequences from over 19,000 proteins (including spectra of synthetic peptides). However, it has remained challenging to find and inspect spectra of peptides covering functional protein regions or matching novel proteins. ProteinExplorer addresses these challenges with an intuitive interface mapping tens of millions of identifications to functional sites on nearly all human proteins while maintaining provenance for every identification back to the original data set and data file. Additionally, ProteinExplorer facilitates the selection and inspection of HPP-compliant peptides whose spectra can be matched to spectra of synthetic peptides and already includes HPP-compliant evidence for 107 missing (PE2, PE3, and PE4) and 23 dubious (PE5) proteins. Finally, ProteinExplorer allows users to rate spectra and to contribute to a community library of peptides entitled PrEdict (Protein Existance dictionary) mapping to novel proteins but whose preliminary identities have not yet been fully established with community-scale false discovery rates and synthetic peptide spectra.

A summary of validated ubiquitination substrates have been presented and a prediction of new substrates have been conducted in yeast. However, a systematic summary of human ubiquitination substrates containing experimental evidence and the enzymatic cascade of each substrate is not available. In the present study, hUbiquitome web resource is introduced, a public resource for the retrieval of experimentally verified human ubiquitination enzymes and substrates. hUbiquitome is the first comprehensive database of human ubiquitination cascades. Currently, hUbiquitome has in its repertoire curated data comprising 1 E1 enzyme, 12 E2 enzymes, 138 E3 ligases or complexes, 279 different substrate proteins and 17 deubiquitination enzyme terms. The biological functions of substrates from different kinds of E3s were analyzed using the collected data. The findings show that substrates ubiquitinated by RING (Really Interesting New Gene) E3s are enriched most in apoptosis-related processes, whereas substrates ubiquitinated by other E3s are enriched in gene expression-associated processes. An analysis of the data demonstrates the biological process preferences of the different kinds of E3s. hUbiquitome is the first database to systematically collect experimentally validated ubiquitinated proteins and related ubiquitination cascade enzymes which might be helpful in the field of ubiquitination-modification research.

Although the genetic epidemiology of eating disorder is becoming increasingly clear with accumulated studies, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Recently, integration of various high-throughput data expanded the range of candidate genes and started to generate hypotheses for understanding potential pathogenesis in complex diseases. This article presents EDdb (Eating Disorder database), the first evidence-based gene resource for eating disorder. Fifty-nine experimentally validated genes from the literature in relation to eating disorder were collected as the core dataset. Another four datasets with 2824 candidate genes across 601 genome regions were expanded based on the core dataset using different criteria (e.g., protein-protein interactions, shared cytobands, and related complex diseases). Based on human protein-protein interaction data, we reconstructed a potential molecular sub-network related to eating disorder. Furthermore, with an integrative pathway enrichment analysis of genes in EDdb, we identified an extended adipocytokine signaling pathway in eating disorder. Three genes in EDdb (ADIPO (adiponectin), TNF (tumor necrosis factor) and NR3C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1)) link the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) ""adipocytokine signaling pathway"" with the BioCarta ""visceral fat deposits and the metabolic syndrome"" pathway to form a joint pathway.

To enable the secure sharing of case records by clinicians and rare disease scientists, we have developed the PhenomeCentral portal (https://phenomecentral.org). Each record includes a phenotypic description and relevant genetic information (exome or candidate genes). PhenomeCentral identifies similar patients in the database based on semantic similarity between clinical features, automatically prioritized genes from whole-exome data, and candidate genes entered by the users, enabling both hypothesis-free and hypothesis-driven matchmaking. Users can then contact other submitters to follow up on promising matches. PhenomeCentral incorporates data for over 1,000 patients with rare genetic diseases, contributed by the FORGE and Care4Rare Canada projects, the US NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the EU Neuromics and ANDDIrare projects, as well as numerous independent clinicians and scientists.

Despite numerous candidate biomarkers in literature, the costly and lengthy process of validation hampers their clinical translation. Existing omics databases are not suitable for <i>in silico</i> validation due to the ignorance of critical factors, i.e., study design, clinical context of biomarker application, and statistical power. To address the unmet need, we have developed the Molecular Prognostic Indicators in Cirrhosis (MPIC) database as a representative example of an omics database tailored for prognostic biomarker validation. MPIC consists of (i) a molecular and clinical database structured by defined disease context and specific clinical outcome and annotated with employed study design and anticipated statistical power by disease domain experts, (ii) a bioinformatics analysis engine for user-provided gene-signature- or gene-based prognostic prediction, and (iii) a user interface for interactive exploration of relevant clinical cohort/scenario and assessment of significance and reliability of the result for prognostic prediction. MPIC assists cost-effective prognostic biomarker development by facilitating the process of validation, and will transform the care of chronic diseases such as cirrhosis.

29997612,CDG: An Online Server for Detecting Biologically Closest Disease-Causing Genes and its Application to Primary Immunodeficiency.,"High-throughput genomic technologies yield about 20,000 variants in the protein-coding exome of each individual. A commonly used approach to select candidate disease-causing variants is to test whether the associated gene has been previously reported to be disease-causing. In the absence of known disease-causing genes, it can be challenging to associate candidate genes with specific genetic diseases. To facilitate the discovery of novel gene-disease associations, we determined the putative biologically closest known genes and their associated diseases for 13,005 human genes not currently reported to be disease-associated. We used these data to construct the closest disease-causing genes (CDG) server, which can be used to infer the closest genes with an associated disease for a user-defined list of genes or diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the CDG server in five immunodeficiency patient exomes across different diseases and modes of inheritance, where CDG dramatically reduced the number of candidate genes to be evaluated. This resource will be a considerable asset for ascertaining the potential relevance of genetic variants found in patient exomes to specific diseases of interest.

24675620,TIBS: a web database to browse gene expression in irritable bowel syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder. Its symptoms include chronic abdominal pain, bloating gas, diarrhea and constipation. Many IBS patients also have psychological symptoms like depression or anxiety. These unpleasant symptoms significantly lower patients׳ quality of life. The prevalence of IBS in Europe and North America is about 10-15% of the population, which makes IBS a disorder with a high social cost. The pathophysiology of IBS is considered to be multifactorial and the exact cause of the disease remains poorly understood. Recently, a genome-wide expression microarray technique has been applied to investigate the possible mechanisms of IBS. However, a user-friendly database that allows scientists without bioinformatics background to query gene expression levels in these data sets and compare gene expression patterns across different tissues has not yet been established. Therefore, we have integrated four public expression microarray data (320 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases into an online database called Transcriptome of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (TIBS). The gene expression change in IBS patients compared to healthy volunteers or UC patients in jejunum, sigmoid colon, rectum, and descending colon can be queried by gene symbols. Users can compare gene expression levels of IBS patients across these tissues. Sex difference of gene expression in IBS patients was also shown in the database. The current version of TIBS database contains 42,400 annotated gene probe sets represented on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 platform.

21177659,TMPad: an integrated structural database for helix-packing folds in transmembrane proteins.,"α-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins play an important role in many critical and diverse biological processes, and specific associations between TM helices are important determinants for membrane protein folding, dynamics and function. In order to gain insights into the above phenomena, it is necessary to investigate different types of helix-packing modes and interactions. However, such information is difficult to obtain because of the experimental impediment and a lack of a well-annotated source of helix-packing folds in TM proteins. We have developed the TMPad (TransMembrane Protein Helix-Packing Database) which addresses the above issues by integrating experimentally observed helix-helix interactions and related structural information of membrane proteins. Specifically, the TMPad offers pre-calculated geometric descriptors at the helix-packing interface including residue backbone/side-chain contacts, interhelical distances and crossing angles, helical translational shifts and rotational angles. The TMPad also includes the corresponding sequence, topology, lipid accessibility, ligand-binding information and supports structural classification, schematic diagrams and visualization of the above structural features of TM helix-packing. Through detailed annotations and visualizations of helix-packing, this online resource can serve as an information gateway for deciphering the relationship between helix-helix interactions and higher levels of organization in TM protein structure and function.

In OGEE we collect not only experimentally tested essential and non-essential genes, but also associated gene properties that contributes to gene essentiality. We tagged conditionally essential genes that show variable essentiality statuses across datasets to highlight complex interplays between gene functions and environmental/experimental perturbations. OGEE v3 contains gene essentiality datasets for 91 species; almost doubled from 48 species in previous version. To accommodate recent advances on human cancer essential genes (as known as tumor dependency genes) that could serve as targets for cancer treatment and/or drug development, we expanded the collection of human essential genes from 16 cell lines in previous to 581. These human cancer cell lines were tested with high-throughput experiments such as CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi; in total, 150 of which were tested by both techniques.

33938221,D3DistalMutation: a Database to Explore the Effect of Distal Mutations on Enzyme Activity.,"Enzyme activity is affected by amino acid mutations, particularly mutations near the active site. Increasing evidence has shown that distal mutations more than 10 Å away from the active site may significantly affect enzyme activity. However, it is difficult to study the enzyme regulation mechanism of distal mutations due to the lack of a systematic collection of three-dimensional (3D) structures, highlighting distal mutation site and the corresponding enzyme activity change. Therefore, we constructed a distal mutation database, namely, D3DistalMutation, which relates the distal mutation to enzyme activity. As a result, we observed that approximately 80% of distal mutations could affect enzyme activity and 72.7% of distal mutations would decrease or abolish enzyme activity in D3DistalMutation. Only 6.6% of distal mutations in D3DistalMutation could increase enzyme activity, which have great potential to the industrial field. Among these mutations, the Y to F, S to D, and T to D mutations are most likely to increase enzyme activity, which sheds some light on industrial catalysis. Distal mutations decreasing enzyme activity in the allosteric pocket play an indispensable role in allosteric drug design. In addition, the pockets in the enzyme structures are provided to explore the enzyme regulation mechanism of distal mutations.

Construction of gene correlation networks from microarray or RNA-seq expression data has been widely applied to study transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and metabolic pathways under specific conditions. Furthermore, since transcription factors (TFs) are critical regulators of gene expression, it is worth investigating TFs on the promoters of co-expressed genes. Although co-expressed genes and their related metabolic pathways can be easily identified from previous resources, such as EXPath and EXPath Tool, this information is not simultaneously available to identify their regulatory TFs. EXPath 2.0 is an updated database for the investigation of regulatory mechanisms in various plant metabolic pathways with 1,881 microarray and 978 RNA-seq samples. There are six significant improvements in EXPath 2.0: (i) the number of species has been extended from three to six to include Arabidopsis, rice, maize, Medicago, soybean and tomato; (ii) gene expression at various developmental stages have been added; (iii) construction of correlation networks according to a group of genes is available; (iv) hierarchical figures of the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms are accessible; (v) promoter analysis of genes in a metabolic pathway or correlation network is provided; and (vi) user's gene expression data can be uploaded and analyzed.

24678734,Research resource: EPSLiM: ensemble predictor for short linear motifs in nuclear hormone receptors.,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of transcription factors central to regulating many biological processes, including cell growth, death, metabolism, and immune responses. NR-mediated gene expression can be modulated by coactivators and corepressors through direct physical interaction or protein complexes with functional domains in NRs. One class of these domains includes short linear motifs (SLiMs), which facilitate protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and ligand binding primarily in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins. Across all proteins, the number of known SLiMs is limited due to the difficulty in studying IDRs experimentally. Computational tools provide a systematic and data-driven approach for predicting functional motifs that can be used to prioritize experimental efforts. Accordingly, several tools have been developed based on sequence conservation or biophysical features; however, discrepancies in predictions make it difficult to determine the true candidate SLiMs. In this work, we present the ensemble predictor for short linear motifs (EPSLiM), a novel strategy to prioritize the residues that are most likely to be SLiMs in IDRs. EPSLiM applies a generalized linear model to integrate predictions from individual methodologies. We show that EPSLiM outperforms individual predictors, and we apply our method to NRs. The androgen receptor is an example with an N-terminal domain of 559 disordered amino acids that contains several validated SLiMs important for transcriptional activation.

34107869,PINIR: a comprehensive information resource for Pin-II type protease inhibitors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Serine protease inhibitors belonging to the Potato type-II Inhibitor family Protease Inhibitors (Pin-II type PIs) are essential plant defense molecules. They are characterized by multiple inhibitory repeat domains, conserved disulfide bond pattern, and a tripeptide reactive center loop. These features of Pin-II type PIs make them potential molecules for protein engineering and designing inhibitors for agricultural and therapeutic applications. However, the diversity in these PIs remains unexplored due to the lack of annotated protein sequences and their functional attributes in the available databases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a database, PINIR (Pin-II type PIs Information Resource), by systematic collection and manual annotation of 415 Pin-II type PI protein sequences. For each PI, the number and position for signature sequences are specified: 695 domains, 75 linkers, 63 reactive center loops, and 10 disulfide bond patterns are identified and mapped. Database analysis revealed novel subcategories of PIs, species-correlated occurrence of inhibitory domains, reactive center loops, and disulfide bond patterns. By analyzing linker regions, we predict that alternative processing at linker regions could generate PI variants in the Solanaceae family.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PINIR ( https://pinir.ncl.res.in ) provides a web interface for browsing and analyzing the protein sequences of Pin-II type PIs. Information about signature sequences, spatio-temporal expression, biochemical properties, gene sequences, and literature references are provided. Analysis of PINIR depicts conserved species-specific features of Pin-II type PI protein sequences. Diversity in the sequence of inhibitory domains and reactive loops directs potential applications to engineer Pin-II type PIs.

Over the last decades, this species has gone through an observable decline, mostly due to environmental factors. Deciphering the mechanisms of cork oak's response to the environment and getting a deep insight into its biology are crucial to counteract biotic and abiotic stresses compromising the stability of a unique ecosystem. In the light of these setbacks, the publication of the genome in 2018 was a major step towards understanding the genetic make-up of this species. In an effort to integrate this information in a comprehensive, accessible and intuitive format, we have developed The Cork Oak Genome Database Portal (CorkOakDB). The CorkOakDB is supported by the BioData.pt e-infrastructure, the Portuguese ELIXIR node for biological data. The portal gives public access to search and explore the curated genomic and transcriptomic data on this species.

24931982,GRASP: analysis of genotype-phenotype results from 1390 genome-wide association studies and corresponding open access database.,"<h4>Summary</h4>We created a deeply extracted and annotated database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results. GRASP v1.0 contains >6.2 million SNP-phenotype association from among 1390 GWAS studies. We re-annotated GWAS results with 16 annotation sources including some rarely compared to GWAS results (e.g. RNAediting sites, lincRNAs, PTMs).<h4>Motivation</h4>To create a high-quality resource to facilitate further use and interpretation of human GWAS results in order to address important scientific questions.<h4>Results</h4>GWAS have grown exponentially, with increases in sample sizes and markers tested, and continuing bias toward European ancestry samples. GRASP contains >100 000 phenotypes, roughly: eQTLs (71.5%), metabolite QTLs (21.2%), methylation QTLs (4.4%) and diseases, biomarkers and other traits (2.8%). cis-eQTLs, meQTLs, mQTLs and MHC region SNPs are highly enriched among significant results. After removing these categories, GRASP still contains a greater proportion of studies and results than comparable GWAS catalogs. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors pre-dominate remaining GWAS results, followed by immunological, neurological and cancer traits. Significant results in GWAS display a highly gene-centric tendency. Sex chromosome X (OR = 0.18[0.16-0.20]) and Y (OR = 0.003[0.001-0.01]) genes are depleted for GWAS results. Gene length is correlated with GWAS results at nominal significance (P ≤ 0.05) levels. We show this gene-length correlation decays at increasingly more stringent P-value thresholds. Potential pleotropic genes and SNPs enriched for multi-phenotype association in GWAS are identified. However, we note possible population stratification at some of these loci. Finally, via re-annotation we identify compelling functional hypotheses at GWAS loci, in some cases unrealized in studies to date.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pooling summary-level GWAS results and re-annotating with bioinformatics predictions and molecular features provides a good platform for new insights.<h4>Availability</h4>The GRASP database is available at http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp.",False,True,,0.6148085,,grasp,27.99768174,ok,,,,spacy+v2,0.99768174,GRASP,True,True,True,GRASP,http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp,http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp,True,...ailability</h4>The GRASP database is available at http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp.,1,False,True,True

Thus it is of high interest to know which kinase can phosphorylate which proteins. Comprehensive information about phosphorylation sites in Arabidopsis proteins is hosted within the PhosPhAt database (http://phosphat.mpimp-golm.mpg.de). However, our knowledge of the kinases that phosphorylate those sites is dispersed throughout the literature and very difficult to access, particularly for investigators seeking to interpret large scale and high-throughput experiments. Therefore, we aimed to compile information on kinase-substrate interactions and kinase-specific regulatory information and make this available via a new functionality embedded in PhosPhAt. Our approach involved systematic surveying of the literature for regulatory information on the members of the major kinase families in Arabidopsis thaliana, such as CDPKs, MPK(KK)s, AGC kinases and SnRKs, as well as individual kinases from other families. To date, we have researched more than 4450 kinase-related publications, which collectively contain information on about 289 kinases.

And numerous studies have examined gene targets for herbs/ingredients, and link herbs/ingredients to various modern diseases. However, there is currently no systematic database organizing these data for TCM. Therefore, we built HERB, a high-throughput experiment- and reference-guided database of TCM, with its Chinese name as BenCaoZuJian. We re-analyzed 6164 gene expression profiles from 1037 high-throughput experiments evaluating TCM herbs/ingredients, and generated connections between TCM herbs/ingredients and 2837 modern drugs by mapping the comprehensive pharmacotranscriptomics dataset in HERB to CMap, the largest such dataset for modern drugs. Moreover, we manually curated 1241 gene targets and 494 modern diseases for 473 herbs/ingredients from 1966 references published recently, and cross-referenced this novel information to databases containing such data for drugs. Together with database mining and statistical inference, we linked 12 933 targets and 28 212 diseases to 7263 herbs and 49 258 ingredients and provided six pairwise relationships among them in HERB.

After pneumonia, diarrhea remains the second leading cause of neonatal deaths. Numerous viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteric pathogens are associated with diarrhea. With increasing antibiotic resistance among enteric pathogens, there is an urgent need for global surveillance of the mutations and resistance genes primarily responsible for resistance to antibiotic treatment. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms are important in this regard as they have a vast potential to be utilized as molecular diagnostics for gene-disease or pharmacogenomics association studies linking genotype to phenotype. DBDiaSNP is a comprehensive repository of mutations and resistance genes among various diarrheal pathogens and hosts to advance breakthroughs that will find applications from development of sequence-based diagnostic tools to drug discovery. It contains information about 946 mutations and 326 resistance genes compiled from literature and various web resources. As of March 2015, it houses various pathogen genes and the mutations responsible for antibiotic resistance. The pathogens include, for example, DEC (Diarrheagenic E.coli), Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Shigella spp., Clostridium difficile, Aeromonas spp., Helicobacter pylori, Entamoeba histolytica, Vibrio cholera, and viruses. It also includes mutations from hosts (e.g., humans, pigs, others) that render them either susceptible or resistant to a certain type of diarrhea. DBDiaSNP is therefore intended as an integrated open access database for researchers and clinicians working on diarrheal diseases. Additionally, we note that the DBDiaSNP is one of the first antibiotic resistance databases for the diarrheal pathogens covering mutations and resistance genes that have clinical relevance from a broad range of pathogens and hosts.

Drug resistance is a common phenomenon of pathogens, creating a serious problem of inactivation of drugs and antibiotics resulting in occurrence of diseases. Apart from other factors, the MDR genes present in pathogens are shown to be responsible for multidrug resistance. Much of the unorganized information on MDR genes is scattered across the literature and other web resources. Thus, consolidation of such knowledge about MDR genes into one database will make the drug discovery research more efficient. Mining of text for MDR genes has resulted into a large number of publications but in scattered and unorganized form. This information was compiled into a database, which enables a user not only to look at a particular MDR gene but also to find out putative homologs based on sequence similarity, conserved domains, and motifs in proteins encoded by MDR genes more efficiently.

However, most studies and available resources such as Gene Ontology provide only gene-level function annotations, and therefore lose the differential information at the isoform level. Here we report MIsoMine, a high-resolution portal to multiple levels of functional information of alternatively spliced isoforms in the mouse. This data portal provides tissue-specific expression patterns and co-expression networks, along with such previously published functional genomic data as protein domains, predicted isoform-level functions and functional relationships. The core utility of MIsoMine is allowing users to explore a preprocessed, quality-controlled set of RNA-seq data encompassing diverse tissues and cell lineages. Tissue-specific co-expression networks were established, allowing a 2D ranking of isoforms and tissues by co-expression patterns. The results of the multiple isoforms of the same gene are presented in parallel to facilitate direct comparison, with cross-talking to prioritized functions at the isoform level. MIsoMine provides the first isoform-level resolution effort at genome-scale.

Drought is the major abiotic stress restricting plant growth worldwide. A number of genes involved in drought stress response have already been characterized, mainly in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. However, with the aim to produce drought tolerant crop varieties, it is of importance to identify the respective orthologs for each species. We have developed DroughtDB, a manually curated compilation of molecularly characterized genes that are involved in drought stress response. DroughtDB includes information about the originally identified gene, its physiological and/or molecular function and mutant phenotypes and provides detailed information about computed orthologous genes in nine model and crop plant species including maize and barley. All identified orthologs are interlinked with the respective reference entry in MIPS/PGSB PlantsDB, which allows retrieval of additional information like genome context and sequence information. Thus, DroughtDB is a valuable resource and information tool for researchers working on drought stress and will facilitate the identification, analysis and characterization of genes involved in drought stress tolerance in agriculturally important crop plants.

The HSPs are essential for the survival of all living organisms, as they protect the conformations of proteins on exposure to various stress conditions. They are a highly conserved group of proteins involved in diverse physiological functions, including de novo folding, disaggregation and protein trafficking. Moreover, their critical role in the control of disease progression made them a prime target of research. Presently, limited information is available on HSPs in reference to their identification and structural classification across genera. To that extent, HSPIR provides manually curated information on sequence, structure, classification, ontology, domain organization, localization and possible biological functions extracted from UniProt, GenBank, Protein Data Bank and the literature. The database offers interactive search with incorporated tools, which enhances the analysis.

PCC6803 is one of the best studied cyanobacteria and an important model organism for our understanding of photosynthesis. The early availability of its complete genome sequence initiated numerous transcriptome studies, which have generated a wealth of expression data. Analysis of the accumulated data can be a powerful tool to study transcription in a comprehensive manner and to reveal underlying regulatory mechanisms, as well as to annotate genes whose functions are yet unknown. However, use of divergent microarray platforms, as well as distributed data storage make meta-analyses of Synechocystis expression data highly challenging, especially for researchers with limited bioinformatic expertise and resources.

Hence, there is a constant need for finding new treatment strategies for Trypanosomiasis. Combination therapy and repurposing or redesigning of existing inhibitors for new drugs are of high importance to address these hurdles, particularly the drug resistance. Hence, here we report TrypInDB, a searchable online resource of small molecule inhibitors having a varying degree of activity towards Trypanosoma sp. Information of about >14,000 small molecules from >700 published research articles was collected and made as an easy-to-search database. Four major sets of information were made available for each collected inhibitors viz., General information (activity values; source of the inhibitors; enzyme targets; etc.,), Structural information, Toxicity information, and Literature information. More than 25 different information about each inhibitor were collected or predicted and made accessible for searching. The database is designed to be queried easily with multiple-field filters with the provisions to perform sub-structure search and similar FDA approved drug searches.

25332392,lncRNASNP: a database of SNPs in lncRNAs and their potential functions in human and mouse.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in various cellular contexts and diseases by diverse mechanisms. With the rapid growth of identified lncRNAs and disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), there is a great demand to study SNPs in lncRNAs. Aiming to provide a useful resource about lncRNA SNPs, we systematically identified SNPs in lncRNAs and analyzed their potential impacts on lncRNA structure and function. In total, we identified 495,729 and 777,095 SNPs in more than 30,000 lncRNA transcripts in human and mouse, respectively. A large number of SNPs were predicted with the potential to impact on the miRNA-lncRNA interaction. The experimental evidence and conservation of miRNA-lncRNA interaction, as well as miRNA expressions from TCGA were also integrated to prioritize the miRNA-lncRNA interactions and SNPs on the binding sites. Furthermore, by mapping SNPs to GWAS results, we found that 142 human lncRNA SNPs are GWAS tagSNPs and 197,827 lncRNA SNPs are in the GWAS linkage disequilibrium regions. All these data for human and mouse lncRNAs were imported into lncRNASNP database (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/lncRNASNP/), which includes two sub-databases lncRNASNP-human and lncRNASNP-mouse.

30397019,iProteinDB: An Integrative Database of <i>Drosophila</i> Post-translational Modifications.,"Post-translational modification (PTM) serves as a regulatory mechanism for protein function, influencing their stability, interactions, activity and localization, and is critical in many signaling pathways. The best characterized PTM is phosphorylation, whereby a phosphate is added to an acceptor residue, most commonly serine, threonine and tyrosine in metazoans. As proteins are often phosphorylated at multiple sites, identifying those sites that are important for function is a challenging problem. Considering that any given phosphorylation site might be non-functional, prioritizing evolutionarily conserved phosphosites provides a general strategy to identify the putative functional sites. To facilitate the identification of conserved phosphosites, we generated a large-scale phosphoproteomics dataset from <i>Drosophila</i> embryos collected from six closely-related species. We built iProteinDB (https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/iproteindb/), a resource integrating these data with other high-throughput PTM datasets, including vertebrates, and manually curated information for <i>Drosophila</i> At iProteinDB, scientists can view the PTM landscape for any <i>Drosophila</i> protein and identify predicted functional phosphosites based on a comparative analysis of data from closely-related <i>Drosophila</i> species.

No procedure could satisfactorily cover all the structures of the natural products. The misconverted structures had to be corrected manually. However, a nonnegligible number of mistakes were also observed even after manual curation, so a self-checking system was developed and introduced to our work flow.

Although over 200 RBPs are predicted from the Arabidopsis genome alone, relatively little is known about these proteins in plants as many exhibit no homology to known RBPs in other eukaryotes. Furthermore, RBPs likely have low expression levels making them difficult to identify and study. As part of our continuing efforts to understand plant cytosolic gene expression and the factors involved, we employed a combination of affinity chromatography and proteomic techniques to enrich for low abundance RBPs in developing rice seed. Our results have been compiled into RiceRBP (http://www.bioinformatics2.wsu.edu/RiceRBP), a database that contains 257 experimentally identified proteins, many of which have not previously been predicted to be RBPs.

30357390,ALEdb 1.0: a database of mutations from adaptive laboratory evolution experimentation.,"Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) has emerged as an experimental approach to discover causal mutations that confer desired phenotypic functions. ALE not only represents a controllable experimental approach to systematically discover genotype-phenotype relationships, but also allows for the revelation of the series of genetic alterations required to acquire the new phenotype. Numerous ALE studies have been published, providing a strong impetus for developing databases to warehouse experimental evolution information and make it retrievable for large-scale analysis. Here, the first step towards establishing this resource is presented: ALEdb (http://aledb.org). This initial release contains over 11 000 mutations that have been discovered from eleven ALE publications. ALEdb (i) is a web-based platform that comprehensively reports on ALE acquired mutations and their conditions, (ii) reports key mutations using previously established trends, (iii) enables a search-driven workflow to enhance user mutation functional analysis through mutation cross-reference, (iv) allows exporting of mutation query results for custom analysis, (v) includes a bibliome describing the databased experiment publications and (vi) contains experimental evolution mutations from multiple model organisms.

The current dataset is the largest assembled for echinoderm phylogeny and transcriptomics. We used RNA-Seq to profile adult tissues from 42 echinoderm specimens from 24 orders and 37 families. In order to achieve sampling members of clades that span key evolutionary divergence, many of our exemplars were collected from deep and polar seas.<h4>Description</h4>A small fraction of the transcriptome data we produced is being used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Thus to make a larger dataset available to researchers with a wide variety of interests, we made a web-based application, EchinoDB (http://echinodb.uncc.edu). EchinoDB is a repository of orthologous transcripts from echinoderms that is searchable via keywords and sequence similarity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>From transcripts we identified 749,397 clusters of orthologous loci. We have developed the information technology to manage and search the loci their annotations with respect to the Sea Urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) genome. Several users have already taken advantage of these data for spin-off projects in developmental biology, gene family studies, and neuroscience.

Single-target drugs may not always produce desired physiological effects on the entire biological system, even if they have successfully regulated the activities of their designated targets. On the other hand, multicomponent therapy, in which two or more agents simultaneously interact with multiple targets, has attracted growing attention. Many drug combinations consisting of multiple agents have already entered clinical practice, especially in treating complex and refractory diseases. Drug combination database (DCDB), launched in 2010, is the first available database that collects and organizes information on drug combinations, with an aim to facilitate systems-oriented new drug discovery. Here, we report the second major release of DCDB (Version 2.0), which includes 866 new drug combinations (1363 in total), consisting of 904 distinctive components. These drug combinations are curated from ∼140,000 clinical studies and the food and drug administration (FDA) electronic orange book.

While it is impractical to solve all the mutated protein structures experimentally, it is quite feasible to model the mutated structures in silico. Toward this goal, we built a publicly available structure database resource (SNP2Structure, https://apps.icbi.georgetown.edu/snp2structure) focusing on missense mutations, msSNP. Compared with web portals with similar aims, SNP2Structure has the following major advantages. First, our portal offers direct comparison of two related 3D structures. Second, the protein models include all interacting molecules in the original PDB structures, so users are able to determine regions of potential interaction changes when a protein mutation occurs. Third, the mutated structures are available to download locally for further structural and functional analysis.

Hum Mutat 2012; 33:1547-1556.), with interactive tools. The database has been populated with mentions of mutations extracted from full text papers, alignments and structural models. In the new version of the database we aimed to collect the effect of mutations from databases including ClinVar. Because of the low number of available data, even in the case of the widely studied disease-causing ABC proteins, we also included the possible effects of mutations based on SNAP2 and PROVEAN predictions. To aid the interpretation of variations in non-coding regions, the database was supplemented with related DNA level information. Our results emphasize the importance of in silico predictions because of the sparse information available on variants and suggest that mutations at analogous positions in homologous ABC proteins have a strong predictive power for the effects of mutations.

Ectocarpus siliculosus is a model to study the biology of these organisms. Its genome has been sequenced and a number of post-genomic tools have been implemented. Based on this knowledge, we report the reconstruction and analysis of a genome-scale metabolic network for E. siliculosus, EctoGEM (http://ectogem.irisa.fr). This atlas of metabolic pathways consists of 1866 reactions and 2020 metabolites, and its construction was performed by means of an integrative computational approach for identifying metabolic pathways, gap filling and manual refinement. The capability of the network to produce biomass was validated by flux balance analysis. EctoGEM enabled the reannotation of 56 genes within the E. siliculosus genome, and shed light on the evolution of metabolic processes. For example, E. siliculosus has the potential to produce phenylalanine and tyrosine from prephenate and arogenate, but does not possess a phenylalanine hydroxylase, as is found in other stramenopiles. It also possesses the complete eukaryote molybdenum co-factor biosynthesis pathway, as well as a second molybdopterin synthase that was most likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer from cyanobacteria by a common ancestor of stramenopiles.

Unlike well-known PTMs like phosphorylation, glycosylation, SUMOylation, no bioinformatics resources are available for enzymes associated with novel and unusual PTMs. Therefore, we have developed the novPTMenzy database which catalogs information on the sequence, structure, active site and genomic neighborhood of experimentally characterized enzymes involved in five novel PTMs, namely AMPylation, Eliminylation, Sulfation, Hydroxylation and Deamidation. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the sequence and structural features of these known PTM catalyzing enzymes, we have created Hidden Markov Model profiles for the identification of similar PTM catalyzing enzymatic domains in genomic sequences. We have also created predictive rules for grouping them into functional subfamilies and deciphering their mechanistic details by structure-based analysis of their active site pockets. These analytical modules have been made available as user friendly search interfaces of novPTMenzy database. It also has a specialized analysis interface for some PTMs like AMPylation and Eliminylation.

The Orchidaceae is a large family of Angiosperms that exhibits extraordinary biodiversity in terms of both the number of species and their distribution worldwide. Orchids exhibit many unique biological features; however, investigation of these traits is currently constrained due to the limited availability of genomic information. Transcriptome information for five orchid species and one commercial hybrid has been included in the Orchidstra database. Altogether, these comprise >380,000 non-redundant orchid transcript sequences, of which >110,000 are protein-coding genes. Sequences from the transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) were obtained either from output reads from next-generation sequencing technologies assembled into contigs, or from conventional cDNA library approaches. An annotation pipeline using Gene Ontology, KEGG and Pfam was built to assign gene descriptions and functional annotation to protein-coding genes. Deep sequencing of small RNA was also performed for Phalaenopsis aphrodite to search for microRNAs (miRNAs), extending the information archived for this species to miRNA annotation, precursors and putative target genes. The P. aphrodite transcriptome information was further used to design probes for an oligonucleotide microarray, and expression profiling analysis was carried out. The intensities of hybridized probes derived from microarray assays of various tissues were incorporated into the database as part of the functional evidence.

26220682,SpirPro: A Spirulina proteome database and web-based tools for the analysis of protein-protein interactions at the metabolic level in Spirulina (Arthrospira) platensis C1.,"<h4>Background</h4>Spirulina (Arthrospira) platensis is the only cyanobacterium that in addition to being studied at the molecular level and subjected to gene manipulation, can also be mass cultivated in outdoor ponds for commercial use as a food supplement. Thus, encountering environmental changes, including temperature stresses, is common during the mass production of Spirulina. The use of cyanobacteria as an experimental platform, especially for photosynthetic gene manipulation in plants and bacteria, is becoming increasingly important. Understanding the mechanisms and protein-protein interaction networks that underlie low- and high-temperature responses is relevant to Spirulina mass production. To accomplish this goal, high-throughput techniques such as OMICs analyses are used. Thus, large datasets must be collected, managed and subjected to information extraction. Therefore, databases including (i) proteomic analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and (ii) domain/motif visualization tools are required for potential use in temperature response models for plant chloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria.<h4>Descriptions</h4>A web-based repository was developed including an embedded database, SpirPro, and tools for network visualization. Proteome data were analyzed integrated with protein-protein interactions and/or metabolic pathways from KEGG. The repository provides various information, ranging from raw data (2D-gel images) to associated results, such as data from interaction and/or pathway analyses. This integration allows in silico analyses of protein-protein interactions affected at the metabolic level and, particularly, analyses of interactions between and within the affected metabolic pathways under temperature stresses for comparative proteomic analysis.

Therefore, an integral resource of PTM-disease associations (PDAs) would be a great help for both academic research and clinical use. In this work, we reported PTMD, a well-curated database containing PTMs that are associated with human diseases. We manually collected 1950 known PDAs in 749 proteins for 23 types of PTMs and 275 types of diseases from the literature. Database analyses show that phosphorylation has the largest number of disease associations, whereas neurologic diseases have the largest number of PTM associations. We classified all known PDAs into six classes according to the PTM status in diseases and demonstrated that the upregulation and presence of PTM events account for a predominant proportion of disease-associated PTM events. By reconstructing a disease-gene network, we observed that breast cancers have the largest number of associated PTMs and AKT1 has the largest number of PTMs connected to diseases. Finally, the PTMD database was developed with detailed annotations and can be a useful resource for further analyzing the relations between PTMs and human diseases.

Nonetheless, the global pandemic was taken up as a challenge by researchers across the globe to discover an effective cure, either in the form of a drug or vaccine. This resulted in an unprecedented surge of experimental and computational data and publications, which often translated their findings in the form of databases (DBs) and tools. Over 160 such DBs and more than 80 software tools were developed, which are uncharacterized, unannotated, deployed at different universal resource locators and are challenging to reach out through a normal web search. Besides, most of the DBs/tools are present on preprints and are either underutilized or unrecognized because of their inability to make it to top Google search hits. Henceforth, there was a need to crawl and characterize these DBs and create a compendium for easy referencing. The current article is one such concerted effort in this direction to create a COVID-19 resource compendium (COVIDium) that would facilitate the researchers to find suitable DBs and tools for their research studies. COVIDium tries to classify the DBs and tools into 11 broad categories for quick navigation. It also provides end-users some generic hit terms to filter the DB entries for quick access to the resources.

30045691,CIGene: a literature-based online resource for cancer initiation genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cancer initiation genes (CIGs) are genes that can directly promote cell proliferation or induce cancer. There are thousands of published studies identifying various CIGs; however, no systematic collection or description is available.<h4>Results</h4>To construct a CIG reference for genetic screening, we have collected 177 human genes curated from 1507 PubMed abstracts. To facilitate data queries and browsing, the identified CIGs along with extensive bioinformatic annotations were stored in an online database called CIGene. Initial functional analysis revealed an overlooked role for cell motility in cancer initiation. Subsequent cross-referencing of known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes against the 177 CIGs identified 96 and 81 CIGs with and without known oncogenic roles, respectively. Successive network analyses of all 177 CIGs determined that the two groups of genes were more likely to link within their group. The distinct molecular functions for these groups were also confirmed with functional studies. While the 96 known oncogenic genes had fundamental roles in gene regulation and signaling, the remaining 81 genes possessed more ancillary functions, such enhancer binding. Further network and mutational analysis of the 96 known oncogenic genes revealed that mutations in these genes were highly prevalent in multiple cancers. By focusing on breast cancer, we found that 32 of the 96 genes with mutations in breast cancers were significantly associated with patient survival.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As the first literature-based online resource for CIGs, CIGene will serve as a useful gateway for the systematic analysis of cancer initiation.

Our recent analysis revealed that ligand binding residues had a significantly higher mutation rate than other parts of the protein. Here, we built mutLBSgeneDB (mutated Ligand Binding Site gene DataBase) available at http://zhaobioinfo.org/mutLBSgeneDB We collected and curated over 2300 genes (mutLBSgenes) having ∼12 000 somatic mutations at ∼10 000 LBSs across 16 cancer types and selected 744 drug targetable genes (targetable_mutLBSgenes) by incorporating kinases, transcription factors, pharmacological genes, and cancer driver genes. We analyzed LBS mutation information, differential gene expression network, drug response correlation with gene expression, and protein stability changes for all mutLBSgenes using integrated genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, network and functional information.

PeptideAtlas is based on published mass spectrometry (MS) data collected through ProteomeXchange and reanalyzed through a uniform processing and metadata annotation pipeline. All matched MS-derived peptide data are linked to spectral, technical, and biological metadata. Nearly 40 million out of ∼143 million MS/MS (tandem MS) spectra were matched to the reference genome Araport11, identifying ∼0.5 million unique peptides and 17,858 uniquely identified proteins (only isoform per gene) at the highest confidence level (false discovery rate 0.0004; 2 non-nested peptides ≥9 amino acid each), assigned canonical proteins, and 3,543 lower-confidence proteins. Physicochemical protein properties were evaluated for targeted identification of unobserved proteins. Additional proteins and isoforms currently not in Araport11 were identified that were generated from pseudogenes, alternative start, stops, and/or splice variants, and small Open Reading Frames; these features should be considered when updating the Arabidopsis genome. Phosphorylation can be inspected through a sophisticated PTM viewer. PeptideAtlas is integrated with community resources including TAIR, tracks in JBrowse, PPDB, and UniProtKB.

22629346,arrayMap: a reference resource for genomic copy number imbalances in human malignancies.,"<h4>Background</h4>The delineation of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs) from cancer samples has been instrumental for identification of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes and proven useful for clinical marker detection. An increasing number of projects have mapped CNAs using high-resolution microarray based techniques. So far, no single resource does provide a global collection of readily accessible oncogenomic array data.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>We here present arrayMap, a curated reference database and bioinformatics resource targeting copy number profiling data in human cancer. The arrayMap database provides a platform for meta-analysis and systems level data integration of high-resolution oncogenomic CNA data. To date, the resource incorporates more than 40,000 arrays in 224 cancer types extracted from several resources, including the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), EBI's ArrayExpress (AE), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), publication supplements and direct submissions. For the majority of the included datasets, probe level and integrated visualization facilitate gene level and genome wide data review. Results from multi-case selections can be connected to downstream data analysis and visualization tools.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>To our knowledge, currently no data source provides an extensive collection of high resolution oncogenomic CNA data which readily could be used for genomic feature mining, across a representative range of cancer entities. arrayMap represents our effort for providing a long term platform for oncogenomic CNA data independent of specific platform considerations or specific project dependence.

22140215,RAC: Repository of Antibiotic resistance Cassettes.,"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is often due to acquisition of resistance genes associated with different mobile genetic elements. In Gram-negative bacteria, many resistance genes are found as part of small mobile genetic elements called gene cassettes, generally found integrated into larger elements called integrons. Integrons carrying antibiotic resistance gene cassettes are often associated with mobile elements and here are designated 'mobile resistance integrons' (MRIs). More than one cassette can be inserted in the same integron to create arrays that contribute to the spread of multi-resistance. In many sequences in databases such as GenBank, only the genes within cassettes, rather than whole cassettes, are annotated and the same gene/cassette may be given different names in different entries, hampering analysis. We have developed the Repository of Antibiotic resistance Cassettes (RAC) website to provide an archive of gene cassettes that includes alternative gene names from multiple nomenclature systems and allows the community to contribute new cassettes. RAC also offers an additional function that allows users to submit sequences containing cassettes or arrays for annotation using the automatic annotation system Attacca. Attacca recognizes features (gene cassettes, integron regions) and identifies cassette arrays as patterns of features and can also distinguish minor cassette variants that may encode different resistance phenotypes (aacA4 cassettes and bla cassettes-encoding β-lactamases). Gaps in annotations are manually reviewed and those found to correspond to novel cassettes are assigned unique names. While there are other websites dedicated to integrons or antibiotic resistance genes, none includes a complete list of antibiotic resistance gene cassettes in MRI or offers consistent annotation and appropriate naming of all of these cassettes in submitted sequences. RAC thus provides a unique resource for researchers, which should reduce confusion and improve the quality of annotations of gene cassettes in integrons associated with antibiotic resistance.

The Pakistani population has a high ratio of first degree consanguinity, which is why it is a rich source for various kinds of genetic disorders. Due to the heterogeneous composition of Pakistani population, the likelihood of genetic heterogeneity for each disorder is high. Therefore, the compilation and organization of such vast genetic data is necessary to facilitate access for analysis and interpretation to researchers and medical geneticists. The increased research on Pakistani ethnic families for disease gene identification has revealed many mutations, which has led us to develop a Pakistani mutome database entitled ""Pakistan Genetic Mutation Database (PGMD)"". In PGMD, the medico-genetic information about diseases are mainly compiled into Syndromic and Non-syndromic disorders. It is a public database, which can be freely accessed from http://www.pakmutation.com.

The compiled gene information is organized to facilitate direct comparisons with quantitative trait locus (QTL) information in the Q-TARO database. Comparison of genomic locations between functionally characterized genes and the QTLs revealed that QTL clusters were often co-localized with high-density gene regions, and that the genes associated with the QTLs in these clusters were different genes, suggesting that these QTL clusters are likely to be explained by tightly linked but distinct genes.

The database has two interfaces: a table containing gene information, and a genome viewer that allows users to compare the locations of QTLs and functionally characterized genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OGRO on Q-TARO will facilitate a candidate-gene approach to identifying the genes responsible for QTLs. Because the QTL descriptions in Q-TARO contain information on agronomic traits, such comparisons will also facilitate the annotation of functionally characterized genes in terms of their effects on traits important for rice breeding.

26272709,GenomewidePDB 2.0: A Newly Upgraded Versatile Proteogenomic Database for the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project.,"Since the launch of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) in 2012, the number of ""missing"" proteins has fallen to 2932, down from ∼5932 since the number was first counted in 2011. We compared the characteristics of missing proteins with those of already annotated proteins with respect to transcriptional expression pattern and the time periods in which newly identified proteins were annotated. We learned that missing proteins commonly exhibit lower levels of transcriptional expression and less tissue-specific expression compared with already annotated proteins. This makes it more difficult to identify missing proteins as time goes on. One of the C-HPP goals is to identify alternative spliced product of proteins (ASPs), which are usually difficult to find by shot-gun proteomic methods due to their sequence similarities with the representative proteins. To resolve this problem, it may be necessary to use a targeted proteomics approach (e.g., selected and multiple reaction monitoring [S/MRM] assays) and an innovative bioinformatics platform that enables the selection of target peptides for rarely expressed missing proteins or ASPs. Given that the success of efforts to identify missing proteins may rely on more informative public databases, it was necessary to upgrade the available integrative databases. To this end, we attempted to improve the features and utility of GenomewidePDB by integrating transcriptomic information (e.g., alternatively spliced transcripts), annotated peptide information, and an advanced search interface that can find proteins of interest when applying a targeted proteomics strategy. This upgraded version of the database, GenomewidePDB 2.0, may not only expedite identification of the remaining missing proteins but also enhance the exchange of information among the proteome community.

29776332,TelNet - a database for human and yeast genes involved in telomere maintenance.,"<h4>Background</h4>The ends of linear chromosomes, the telomeres, comprise repetitive DNA sequences in complex with proteins that protects them from being processed by the DNA repair machinery. Cancer cells need to counteract the shortening of telomere repeats during replication for their unlimited proliferation by reactivating the reverse transcriptase telomerase or by using the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. The different telomere maintenance (TM) mechanisms appear to involve hundreds of proteins but their telomere repeat length related activities are only partly understood. Currently, a database that integrates information on TM relevant genes is missing.<h4>Description</h4>To provide a resource for studies that dissect TM features, we here introduce the TelNet database at http://www.cancertelsys.org/telnet/ . It offers a comprehensive compilation of more than 2000 human and 1100 yeast genes linked to telomere maintenance. These genes were annotated in terms of TM mechanism, associated specific functions and orthologous genes, a TM significance score and information from peer-reviewed literature. This TM information can be retrieved via different search and view modes and evaluated for a set of genes as demonstrated for an exemplary application.<h4>Conclusion</h4>TelNet supports the annotation of genes identified from bioinformatics analysis pipelines to reveal possible connections with TM networks.

Integrative analysis based on this resource revealed that top-ranked genes derived from TCGA tumour and adjacent normal samples share an overwhelming part of biological processes, which are quite different than those from CCLE and GTEx. The most active miRNAs predicted to target CDS and promoter regions are largely overlapped. These findings corroborate that adjacent normal tissues might have undergone significant molecular transformations towards oncogenesis before phenotypic and histological change; and there probably exists a small yet critical set of miRNAs that profoundly influence various cancer hallmark processes. miRactDB provides a unique resource for the cancer and genomics communities to screen, prioritize and rationalize their candidates of miRNA-gene interactions, in both normal and cancer scenarios.",False,True,,0.67158085,miractdb,,24.99910307,ok,,,tcga,spacy+v2,0.99910307,,True,False,False,miRactDB,https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB,https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB,True,"...RactDB, a database for miRNA-gene interaction, at https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB, to provide a versatile resource and platform for...",1,True,True,True

23951158,FmMDb: a versatile database of foxtail millet markers for millets and bioenergy grasses research.,"The prominent attributes of foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) including its small genome size, short life cycle, inbreeding nature, and phylogenetic proximity to various biofuel crops have made this crop an excellent model system to investigate various aspects of architectural, evolutionary and physiological significances in Panicoid bioenergy grasses. After release of its whole genome sequence, large-scale genomic resources in terms of molecular markers were generated for the improvement of both foxtail millet and its related species. Hence it is now essential to congregate, curate and make available these genomic resources for the benefit of researchers and breeders working towards crop improvement. In view of this, we have constructed the Foxtail millet Marker Database (FmMDb; http://www.nipgr.res.in/foxtail.html), a comprehensive online database for information retrieval, visualization and management of large-scale marker datasets with unrestricted public access.

21729256,RASOnD-a comprehensive resource and search tool for RAS superfamily oncogenes from various species.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Ras superfamily plays an important role in the control of cell signalling and division. Mutations in the Ras genes convert them into active oncogenes. The Ras oncogenes form a major thrust of global cancer research as they are involved in the development and progression of tumors. This has resulted in the exponential growth of data on Ras superfamily across different public databases and in literature. However, no dedicated public resource is currently available for data mining and analysis on this family. The present database was developed to facilitate straightforward accession, retrieval and analysis of information available on Ras oncogenes from one particular site.<h4>Description</h4>We have developed the RAS Oncogene Database (RASOnD) as a comprehensive knowledgebase that provides integrated and curated information on a single platform for oncogenes of Ras superfamily. RASOnD encompasses exhaustive genomics and proteomics data existing across diverse publicly accessible databases. This resource presently includes overall 199,046 entries from 101 different species. It provides a search tool to generate information about their nucleotide and amino acid sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms, chromosome positions, orthologies, motifs, structures, related pathways and associated diseases. We have implemented a number of user-friendly search interfaces and sequence analysis tools. At present the user can (i) browse the data (ii) search any field through a simple or advance search interface and (iii) perform a BLAST search and subsequently CLUSTALW multiple sequence alignment by selecting sequences of Ras oncogenes. The Generic gene browser, GBrowse, JMOL for structural visualization and TREEVIEW for phylograms have been integrated for clear perception of retrieved data. External links to related databases have been included in RASOnD.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This database is a resource and search tool dedicated to Ras oncogenes. It has utility to cancer biologists and cell molecular biologists as it is a ready source for research, identification and elucidation of the role of these oncogenes. The data generated can be used for understanding the relationship between the Ras oncogenes and their association with cancer.

Focusing on snail species Cochlicella acuta and Helix aspersa and reticulated slugs Deroceras invadens, Deroceras reticulatum, Lehmannia nyctelia and Milax gagates, we obtained a total of 367,869,636 high-quality reads and compared them with existing CNS transcript resources for the invasive Mediterranean snail, Theba pisana. In total, we obtained 419,289 unique transcripts (unigenes) from 1,410,569 assembled contigs, with blast search analysis of multiple protein databases leading to the annotation of 124,268 unigenes, of which 92,544 mapped to ncbi nonredundant protein databases. We found that these transcriptomes have representatives in most biological functions, based on comparison of gene ontology, kegg pathway and protein family contents, demonstrating a high range of transcripts responsible for regulating metabolic activities and molecular functions occurring within the CNS. To provide an accessible genetic resource, we also demonstrate the presence of 66,687 microsatellites and 304,693 single-nucleotide variants, which can be used for the design of potentially thousands of unique primers for functional screening.

Inaccurate and delayed diagnoses increase the risk, especially in developing countries. Studies have indicated the significant roles of genetic elements in ILDs pathogenesis. Therefore, the first genetic knowledge resource, ILDgenDB, has been developed with an objective to provide ILDs genetic data and their integrated analyses for the better understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of diagnostics-based biomarkers. This resource contains literature-curated disease candidate genes (DCGs) enriched with various regulatory elements that have been generated using an integrated bioinformatics workflow of databases searches, literature-mining and DCGs-microRNA (miRNAs)-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analyses. To provide statistical significance to disease-gene association, ILD-specificity index and hypergeomatric test scores were also incorporated. Association analyses of miRNAs, SNPs and pathways responsible for the pathogenesis of different sub-classes of ILDs were also incorporated. Manually verified 299 DCGs and their significant associations with 1932 SNPs, 2966 miRNAs and 9170 miR-polymorphisms were also provided. Furthermore, 216 literature-mined and proposed biomarkers were identified. The ILDgenDB resource provides user-friendly browsing and extensive query-based information retrieval systems. Additionally, this resource also facilitates graphical view of predicted DCGs-SNPs/miRNAs and literature associated DCGs-ILDs interactions for each ILD to facilitate efficient data interpretation.

Since the release of SelenoDB 1.0 many new animal genomes have been sequenced. The annotations of selenoproteins in new genomes usually contain many errors in major databases. For this reason, we have now fully annotated selenoprotein genes in 58 animal genomes. We provide manually curated annotations for human selenoproteins, whereas we use an automatic annotation pipeline to annotate selenoprotein genes in other animal genomes. In addition, we annotate the homologous genes containing cysteine (Cys) instead of Sec. Finally, we have surveyed genetic variation in the annotated genes in humans. We use exon capture and resequencing approaches to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms in more than 50 human populations around the world.

Besides ATG proteins, numerous regulators together with various post-translational modifications (PTMs) are also involved in autophagy. In this work, we collected 4,237 experimentally identified proteins regulated in autophagy and cell death pathways from the literature. Then we computationally identified potential orthologs of known proteins, and developed a comprehensive database of The Autophagy, Necrosis, ApopTosis OrchestratorS (THANATOS, http://thanatos.biocuckoo.org ), containing 191,543 proteins potentially associated with autophagy and cell death pathways in 164 eukaryotes. We performed an evolutionary analysis of ATG genes, and observed that ATGs required for the autophagosome formation are highly conserved across eukaryotes. Further analyses revealed that known cancer genes and drug targets were overrepresented in human autophagy proteins, which were significantly associated in a number of signaling pathways and human diseases. By reconstructing a human kinase-substrate phosphorylation network for ATG proteins, our results confirmed that phosphorylation play a critical role in regulating autophagy. In total, we mapped 65,015 known sites of 11 types of PTMs to collected proteins, and revealed that all types of PTM substrates were enriched in human autophagy. In addition, we observed multiple types of PTM regulators such as protein kinases and ubiquitin E3 ligases or adaptors were significantly associated with human autophagy, and again the results emphasized the importance of PTM regulations in autophagy.

Despite the advances in protein structure alignment algorithms, some of the local conformationally similar regions are mislabeled as structurally variable regions (SVRs). These regions are not well superimposed because of differences in their spatial orientations. The Database of Structural Alignments (DoSA) addresses this gap in identification of local structural similarities obscured in global protein structural alignments by realigning SVRs using an algorithm based on protein blocks. A set of protein blocks is a structural alphabet that abstracts protein structures into 16 unique local structural motifs. DoSA provides unique information about 159,780 conformationally similar and 56,140 conformationally dissimilar SVRs in 74 705 pairwise structural alignments of homologous proteins. The information provided on conformationally similar and dissimilar SVRs can be helpful to model loop regions. It is also conceivable that conformationally similar SVRs with conserved residues could potentially contribute toward functional integrity of homologues, and hence identifying such SVRs could be helpful in understanding the structural basis of protein function.

Emerging global mapping by Chromatin ImmnoPrecipitation (ChIP)-based high-throughput experiments indicate that YY1 binds to a vast number of loci genome-wide. However, the information is widely scattered in many disparate poorly cross-indexed literatures; a large portion was only published recently by the ENCODE consortium with limited annotation. A centralized database, which annotates and organizes YY1-binding loci and target motifs in a systematic way with easy access, will be valuable resources for the research community. We therefore implemented a web-based YY1 Target loci Database (YY1TargetDB).

29145823,dbMDEGA: a database for meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes in autism spectrum disorder.,"<h4>Background</h4>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are hereditary, heterogeneous and biologically complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Individual studies on gene expression in ASD cannot provide clear consensus conclusions. Therefore, a systematic review to synthesize the current findings from brain tissues and a search tool to share the meta-analysis results are urgently needed.<h4>Methods</h4>Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of brain gene expression profiles in the current reported human ASD expression datasets (with 84 frozen male cortex samples, 17 female cortex samples, 32 cerebellum samples and 4 formalin fixed samples) and knock-out mouse ASD model expression datasets (with 80 collective brain samples). Then, we applied R language software and developed an interactive shared and updated database (dbMDEGA) displaying the results of meta-analysis of data from ASD studies regarding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain.<h4>Results</h4>This database, dbMDEGA ( https://dbmdega.shinyapps.io/dbMDEGA/ ), is a publicly available web-portal for manual annotation and visualization of DEGs in the brain from data from ASD studies. This database uniquely presents meta-analysis values and homologous forest plots of DEGs in brain tissues. Gene entries are annotated with meta-values, statistical values and forest plots of DEGs in brain samples. This database aims to provide searchable meta-analysis results based on the current reported brain gene expression datasets of ASD to help detect candidate genes underlying this disorder.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This new analytical tool may provide valuable assistance in the discovery of DEGs and the elucidation of the molecular pathogenicity of ASD.

Autophagy can serve as an antiviral defense mechanism but also as a proviral process during infection. Atg8-family proteins play a central role in the autophagy process due to their ability to interact with components of the autophagy machinery as well as selective autophagy receptors and adaptor proteins. Such interactions are usually mediated through LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs. So far, only one viral protein has been experimentally shown to have a functional LIR motif, leaving open a vast field for investigation. Here, we have developed the iLIR@viral database ( http://ilir.uk/virus/ ) as a freely accessible web resource listing all the putative canonical LIR motifs identified in viral proteins.

33306800,CEG 2.0: an updated database of clusters of essential genes including eukaryotic organisms.,"Essential genes are key elements for organisms to maintain their living. Building databases that store essential genes in the form of homologous clusters, rather than storing them as a singleton, can provide more enlightening information such as the general essentiality of homologous genes in multiple organisms. In 2013, the first database to store prokaryotic essential genes in clusters, CEG (Clusters of Essential Genes), was constructed. Afterward, the amount of available data for essential genes increased by a factor >3 since the last revision. Herein, we updated CEG to version 2, including more prokaryotic essential genes (from 16 gene datasets to 29 gene datasets) and newly added eukaryotic essential genes (nine species), specifically the human essential genes of 12 cancer cell lines. For prokaryotes, information associated with drug targets, such as protein structure, ligand-protein interaction, virulence factor and matched drugs, is also provided. Finally, we provided the service of essential gene prediction for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

22080561,GABI-Kat SimpleSearch: new features of the Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA mutant database.,"T-DNA insertion mutants are very valuable for reverse genetics in Arabidopsis thaliana. Several projects have generated large sequence-indexed collections of T-DNA insertion lines, of which GABI-Kat is the second largest resource worldwide. User access to the collection and its Flanking Sequence Tags (FSTs) is provided by the front end SimpleSearch (http://www.GABI-Kat.de). Several significant improvements have been implemented recently. The database now relies on the TAIRv10 genome sequence and annotation dataset. All FSTs have been newly mapped using an optimized procedure that leads to improved accuracy of insertion site predictions. A fraction of the collection with weak FST yield was re-analysed by generating new FSTs. Along with newly found predictions for older sequences about 20,000 new FSTs were included in the database. Information about groups of FSTs pointing to the same insertion site that is found in several lines but is real only in a single line are included, and many problematic FST-to-line links have been corrected using new wet-lab data.

33121433,circVAR database: genome-wide archive of genetic variants for human circular RNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in regulating gene expression through binding miRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Genetic variation of circRNAs may affect complex traits/diseases by changing their binding efficiency to target miRNAs and proteins. There is a growing demand for investigations of the functions of genetic changes using large-scale experimental evidence. However, there is no online genetic resource for circRNA genes.<h4>Results</h4>We performed extensive genetic annotation of 295,526 circRNAs integrated from circBase, circNet and circRNAdb. All pre-computed genetic variants were presented at our online resource, circVAR, with data browsing and search functionality. We explored the chromosome-based distribution of circRNAs and their associated variants. We found that, based on mapping to the 1000 Genomes and ClinVAR databases, chromosome 17 has a relatively large number of circRNAs and associated common and health-related genetic variants. Following the annotation of genome wide association studies (GWAS)-based circRNA variants, we found many non-coding variants within circRNAs, suggesting novel mechanisms for common diseases reported from GWAS studies. For cancer-based somatic variants, we found that chromosome 7 has many highly complex mutations that have been overlooked in previous research.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We used the circVAR database to collect SNPs and small insertions and deletions (INDELs) in putative circRNA regions and to identify their potential phenotypic information.

The main feature in this version is the inclusion of newly sequenced genotypes and their meta-information, giving a total of 217 accessions of 19 wild Oryza species (O. rufipogon, O. barthii, O. longistaminata, O. meridionalis, O. glumaepatula, O. punctata, O. minuta, O. officinalis, O. rhizomatis, O. eichingeri, O. latifolia, O. alta, O. grandiglumis, O. australiensis, O. brachyantha, O. granulata, O. meyeriana, O. ridleyi, and O. longiglumis). These 19 wild species belong to 9 genome types (AA, BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG, and HHJJ), representing wide genomic diversity in the genus. Using the genotype information, we analyzed the genome diversity of Oryza species. Other features of OryzaGenome facilitate the use of information on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between O. sativa and its wild progenitor O. rufipogon in rice research, including breeding as well as basic science. For example, we provide Variant Call Format (VCF) files for genome-wide SNPs of 33 O. rufipogon accessions against the O. sativa reference genome, IRGSP1.0. In addition, we provide a new SNP Effect Table function, allowing users to identify SNPs or small insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the 33 O. rufipogon accessions and to search for the effect of these polymorphisms on protein function if they reside in the coding region (e.g., are missense or nonsense mutations). Furthermore, the SNP Viewer for 446 O. rufipogon accessions was updated by implementing new tracks for possible selective sweep regions and highly mutated regions that were potentially exposed to selective pressures during the process of domestication.<h4>Conclusion</h4>OryzaGenome2.1 focuses on comparative genomic analysis of diverse wild Oryza accessions collected around the world and on the development of resources to speed up the identification of critical trait-related genes, especially from O. rufipogon.

The healthy effects of tea are attributed to a wealthy of different chemical components from tea. Thousands of studies on the chemical constituents of tea had been reported. However, data from these individual reports have not been collected into a single database. The lack of a curated database of related information limits research in this field, and thus a cohesive database system should necessarily be constructed for data deposit and further application.<h4>Description</h4>The Tea Metabolome database (TMDB), a manually curated and web-accessible database, was developed to provide detailed, searchable descriptions of small molecular compounds found in Camellia spp. esp. in the plant Camellia sinensis and compounds in its manufactured products (different kinds of tea infusion). TMDB is currently the most complete and comprehensive curated collection of tea compounds data in the world. It contains records for more than 1393 constituents found in tea with information gathered from 364 published books, journal articles, and electronic databases.

The Text-mined Hypertension, Obesity and Diabetes candidate gene database (T-HOD) is developed to help trace existing research on three kinds of cardiovascular diseases: hypertension, obesity and diabetes, with the last disease categorized into Type 1 and Type 2, by regularly and semiautomatically extracting HOD-related genes from newly published literature. Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for hypertension, obesity and diabetes, respectively. T-HOD employed the state-of-art text-mining technologies, including a gene/disease identification system and a disease-gene relation extraction system, which can be used to affirm the association of genes with three diseases and provide more evidence for further studies. The primary inputs of T-HOD are the three kinds of diseases, and the output is a list of disease-related genes that can be ranked based on their number of appearance, protein-protein interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Unlike manually constructed disease gene databases, the content of T-HOD is regularly updated by our text-mining system and verified by domain experts. The interface of T-HOD facilitates easy browsing for users and allows T-HOD curators to verify data efficiently.

22493526,IntDb: A comprehensive database for classified introns of saccharomyces & human.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Introns (intra-genic) are non-coding regions of several eukaryotic genes. However, their role in regulation of transcription, embryonic development, stimulate gene (HEG) is apparent in recent years. Thus current research focuses on mutation in introns and their influence in causing various diseases. Though many available intron databases like YIDB, IDB, ExInt, GISSD, FUGOID, etc. discusses on various aspects of introns but none of them have classified the introns where identification of start intron is found to be important which mainly regulates the various activities of protein at gene level. This lead to an idea for development of ""Intdb""; a database meant for classifying introns as start, middle and stop on the basis of position of specific consensus site. Information provided in IntDb is useful for gene prediction, determination of splicing sites and identification of diseases. In addition, the main focus is on violation of consensus rule and frequency of other deviations observed in classified introns. Further, GC content, length variations according to the biased residues and occurrence of consensus pattern to discover potential role of introns is also emphasized in IntDb.<h4>Availability</h4>The database is available for free at http://introndb.bicpu.edu.in/",False,True,,0.6994483,,intdb,23.9971026,ok,,,i | ntdb,spacy+v2,0.9971026,IntDb,True,True,True,IntDb,http://introndb.bicpu.edu.in/,http://introndb.bicpu.edu.in/,True,...ability</h4>The database is available for free at http://introndb.bicpu.edu.in/,1,True,True,True
21622657,BAR-PLUS: the Bologna Annotation Resource Plus for functional and structural annotation of protein sequences.,"We introduce BAR-PLUS (BAR(+)), a web server for functional and structural annotation of protein sequences. BAR(+) is based on a large-scale genome cross comparison and a non-hierarchical clustering procedure characterized by a metric that ensures a reliable transfer of features within clusters. In this version, the method takes advantage of a large-scale pairwise sequence comparison of 13,495,736 protein chains also including 988 complete proteomes. Available sequence annotation is derived from UniProtKB, GO, Pfam and PDB. When PDB templates are present within a cluster (with or without their SCOP classification), profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are computed on the basis of sequence to structure alignment and are cluster-associated (Cluster-HMM). Therefrom, a library of 10,858 HMMs is made available for aligning even distantly related sequences for structural modelling. The server also provides pairwise query sequence-structural target alignments computed from the correspondent Cluster-HMM. BAR(+) in its present version allows three main categories of annotation: PDB [with or without SCOP (*)] and GO and/or Pfam; PDB (*) without GO and/or Pfam; GO and/or Pfam without PDB (*) and no annotation. Each category can further comprise clusters where GO and Pfam functional annotations are or are not statistically significant.

31612943,OHNOLOGS v2: a comprehensive resource for the genes retained from whole genome duplication in vertebrates.,"All vertebrates including human have evolved from an ancestor that underwent two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD). In addition, teleost fish underwent an additional third round of genome duplication (3R-WGD). The genes retained from these genome duplications, so-called ohnologs, have been instrumental in the evolution of vertebrate complexity, development and susceptibility to genetic diseases. However, the identification of vertebrate ohnologs has been challenging, due to lineage specific genome rearrangements since 2R- and 3R-WGD. We previously identified vertebrate ohnologs using a novel synteny comparison across multiple genomes. Here, we refine and apply this approach on 27 vertebrate genomes to identify ohnologs from both 2R- and 3R-WGD, while taking into account the phylogenetically biased sampling of available species. We assemble vertebrate ohnolog pairs and families in an expanded OHNOLOGS v2 database. We find that teleost fish have retained more 2R-WGD ohnologs than mammals and sauropsids, and that these 2R-ohnologs have retained significantly more ohnologs from the subsequent 3R-WGD than genes without 2R-ohnologs. Interestingly, species with fewer extant genes, such as sauropsids, have retained similar or higher proportions of ohnologs.

These molecules, currently found in more than 25 plant families and with a wide structural diversity, exert a variety of biological-pharmacological effects and are of high ethnopharmacological importance. However, information is scattered in literature, with different, often unstandardized, pharmacological methodologies being used. Therefore, a comprehensive NAA database (acronym: Alkamid) was constructed to collect the available structural and functional NAA data, linked to their occurrence in plants (family, tribe, species, genus).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>For loading information in the database, literature data was gathered over the period 1950-2010, by using several search engines.

Up to now, an index of known face databases, their features, and how to access them has not been available. This absence has had at least two negative repercussions: First, without alternatives, some researchers may have used face databases that are widely known but not optimal for their research. Second, a reliance on databases comprised only of young white faces will lead to science that isn't representative of all the people whose tax contributions, in many cases, make that research possible. The ""Face Image Meta-Database"" (fIMDb) provides researchers with the tools to find the face images best suited to their research, with filters to locate databases with people of a varied racial and ethnic backgrounds and ages. Problems of representation in face databases are not restricted to race and ethnicity or age - there is a dearth of databases with faces that have visible differences (e.g., scars, port wine stains, and cleft lip and palate). A well-characterized database is needed to support programmatic research into perceivers' attitudes, behaviors, and neural responses to anomalous faces.

22465851,Enhancing a Pathway-Genome Database (PGDB) to capture subcellular localization of metabolites and enzymes: the nucleotide-sugar biosynthetic pathways of Populus trichocarpa.,"Understanding how cellular metabolism works and is regulated requires that the underlying biochemical pathways be adequately represented and integrated with large metabolomic data sets to establish a robust network model. Genetically engineering energy crops to be less recalcitrant to saccharification requires detailed knowledge of plant polysaccharide structures and a thorough understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in forming and regulating cell-wall synthesis. Nucleotide-sugars are building blocks for synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides. The biosynthesis of nucleotide-sugars is catalyzed by a multitude of enzymes that reside in different subcellular organelles, and precise representation of these pathways requires accurate capture of this biological compartmentalization. The lack of simple localization cues in genomic sequence data and annotations however leads to missing compartmentalization information for eukaryotes in automatically generated databases, such as the Pathway-Genome Databases (PGDBs) of the SRI Pathway Tools software that drives much biochemical knowledge representation on the internet. In this report, we provide an informal mechanism using the existing Pathway Tools framework to integrate protein and metabolite sub-cellular localization data with the existing representation of the nucleotide-sugar metabolic pathways in a prototype PGDB for Populus trichocarpa. The enhanced pathway representations have been successfully used to map SNP abundance data to individual nucleotide-sugar biosynthetic genes in the PGDB. The manually curated pathway representations are more conducive to the construction of a computational platform that will allow the simulation of natural and engineered nucleotide-sugar precursor fluxes into specific recalcitrant polysaccharide(s).

25562198,ExcellmiRDB for translational genomics: a curated online resource for extracellular microRNAs.,"A large number of studies have suggested extracellular microRNAs (microRNAs in biofluids) as potential noninvasive biomarkers for pathophysiological conditions such as cancer. However, reported differentially expressed signatures of extracellular miRNAs in diseases are not uniformly consistent among studies. Here, we present ""ExcellmiRDB"", a curated online database that provides integrated information about miRNAs levels in biofluids in a user-friendly way. Although many miRNA databases, including disease-oriented databases, have been launched before, the ExcellmiRDB is so far the only one specialized for storing curated data on miRNA levels in biofluid samples. At present, ExcellmiRDB has 2773 disease-extracellular miRNAs and 1108 biofluid-extracellular miRNAs relationships curated from 108 articles selected from more than 600 surveyed PubMed abstracts. Information about 992 miRNAs, 82 diseases, 21 biofluids, 8 species, 63 normalization reference genes, 5 techniques, 14 GEO profiles accession numbers, 7 human ethnic groups, and 18 compared clinical biomarkers have been provided in the database. A user can query ExcellmiRDB by selecting a disease or a miRNA or a biofluid. Additionally, the database provides two online network graphs to visualize and interact with the content of the database. The first network shows disease-extracellular miRNAs relationships, along with expression patterns and number of articles for a relationship. The second network visualizes biofluid-extracellular miRNAs relationships showing miRNAs spectrum across different types of biofluids.

33507270,InSexBase: an annotated genomic resource of sex chromosomes and sex-biased genes in insects.,"Sex determination and the regulation of sexual dimorphism are among the most fascinating topics in modern biology. As the most species-rich group of sexually reproducing organisms on Earth, insects have multiple sex determination systems. Though sex chromosomes and sex-biased genes are well-studied in dozens of insects, their gene sequences are scattered in various databases. Moreover, a shortage of annotation hinders the deep mining of these data. Here, we collected the chromosome-level sex chromosome data of 49 insect species, including 34 X chromosomes, 15 Z chromosomes, 5 W chromosomes and 2 Y chromosomes. We also obtained Y-linked contigs of four insects species-Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila innubila, Drosophila yakuba and Tribolium castaneum. The unannotated chromosome-level sex chromosomes were annotated using a standard pipeline, yielding a total of 123 030 protein-coding genes, 2 159 427 repeat sequences, 894 miRNAs, 1574 rRNAs, 5105 tRNAs, 395 snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNA), 54 snRNAs (small nuclear RNA) and 5959 other ncRNAs (non-coding RNA). In addition, 36 781 sex-biased genes were identified by analyzing 62 RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) datasets. Together with 5707 sex-biased genes from the Drosophila genus collected from the Sex-Associated Gene Database, we obtained a total of 42 488 sex-biased genes from 13 insect species.

29548284,IDPM: an online database for ion distribution in protein molecules.,"<h4>Background</h4>Interactions between ions and proteins have been extensively studied, yet most of the studies focus on the ion binding site. The binding mechanism for many ion binding sites can be clearly described from high resolution structures. Although knowledge accumulated on a case-by-case basis is valuable, it is also important to study the ion-protein interaction statistically. From experimentally determined structures, it is possible to examine the ion distribution around each amino acid. Such distributions can reveal relation between ions and amino acids, so it is desirable to carry out a systematic survey of 'ion-amino acid' pairing interaction and share the information with a publicly available database.<h4>Results</h4>The survey in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) revealed that approximately 40% of molecules records contain at least one ion. To reduce the bias resulted from protein redundancy, the statistics were extracted from a non-redundant dataset by excluding the proteins with similar sequences. Based on the structures of protein molecules and the location of ions, the statistical distributions of ions around each proteinogenic amino acid type were investigated and further summarized in a database. To systematically quantify the interactions between ions and each amino acid, the positions of ions were mapped to the coordinate system centered at each neighboring amino acid. It was found that the distribution of ions follows the expected rules governed by the physicochemical interactions in general. Large variations were observed, reflecting the preference in 'ion-amino acid' interactions. The analysis program is written in the Python programming language. The statistical results and program are available from the online database: ion distribution in protein molecules (IDPM) at http://liulab.csrc.ac.cn/idpm/ .<h4>Conclusion</h4>The spatial distribution of ions around amino acids is documented and analyzed.

Recently, a large number of high-quality transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets for apple were made available to the public, which could be helpful in inferring gene regulatory relationships and thus predicting gene function at the genome level. Through integration of the available apple genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets, we constructed co-expression networks, identified functional modules, and predicted chromatin states. A total of 112 RNA-seq datasets were integrated to construct a global network and a conditional network (tissue-preferential network). Furthermore, a total of 1,076 functional modules with closely related gene sets were identified to assess the modularity of biological networks and further subjected to functional enrichment analysis. The results showed that the function of many modules was related to development, secondary metabolism, hormone response, and transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional regulation is closely related to epigenetic marks on chromatin. A total of 20 epigenomic datasets, which included ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and DNA methylation analysis datasets, were integrated and used to classify chromatin states. Based on the ChromHMM algorithm, the genome was divided into 620,122 fragments, which were classified into 24 states according to the combination of epigenetic marks and enriched-feature regions.

33942873,"CANNUSE, a database of traditional Cannabis uses-an opportunity for new research.","Cannabis is one of the most versatile genera in terms of plant uses and has been exploited by humans for millennia due to its medicinal properties, strong fibres, nutritious seeds and psychoactive resin. Nowadays, Cannabis is the centre of many scientific studies, which mainly focus on its chemical composition and medicinal properties. Unfortunately, while new applications of this plant are continuously being developed, some of its traditional uses are becoming rare and even disappearing altogether. Information on traditional uses of Cannabis is vast, but it is scattered across many publication sources in different formats, so synthesis and standardization of these data are increasingly important. The CANNUSE database provides an organized information source for scientists and general public interested in different aspects of Cannabis use. It contains over 2300 entries from 649 publications related to medicinal, alimentary, fibre and other uses from different geographical areas and cultures around the world.

30341991,The Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database.,"This dataset provides the Global Naturalized Alien Flora (GloNAF) database, version 1.2. GloNAF represents a data compendium on the occurrence and identity of naturalized alien vascular plant taxa across geographic regions (e.g. countries, states, provinces, districts, islands) around the globe. The dataset includes 13,939 taxa and covers 1,029 regions (including 381 islands). The dataset is based on 210 data sources. For each taxon-by-region combination, we provide information on whether the taxon is considered to be naturalized in the specific region (i.e. has established self-sustaining populations in the wild). Non-native taxa are marked as ""alien"", when it is not clear whether they are naturalized. To facilitate alignment with other plant databases, we provide for each taxon the name as given in the original data source and the standardized taxon and family names used by The Plant List Version 1.1 (http://www.theplantlist.org/). We provide an ESRI shapefile including polygons for each region and information on whether it is an island or a mainland region, the country and the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG) regions it is part of (TDWG levels 1-4). We also provide several variables that can be used to filter the data according to quality and completeness of alien taxon lists, which vary among the combinations of regions and data sources. A previous version of the GloNAF dataset (version 1.1) has already been used in several studies on, for example, historical spatial flows of taxa between continents and geographical patterns and determinants of naturalization across different taxonomic groups. We intend the updated and expanded GloNAF version presented here to be a global resource useful for studying plant invasions and changes in biodiversity from regional to global scales.

It is involved in many plant biological processes, such as plant growth, organ development, and plant immunology, by regulating or switching signaling and metabolic pathways. High-throughput experimental methods like mass spectrometry can easily characterize hundreds to thousands of phosphorylation events in a single experiment. With the increasing volume of the data sets, Plant Protein Phosphorylation DataBase (P3DB, http://p3db.org ) provides a comprehensive, systematic, and interactive online platform to deposit, query, analyze, and visualize these phosphorylation events in many plant species. It stores the protein phosphorylation sites in the context of identified mass spectra, phosphopeptides, and phosphoproteins contributed from various plant proteome studies. In addition, P3DB associates these plant phosphorylation sites to protein physicochemical information in the protein charts and tertiary structures, while various protein annotations from hierarchical kinase phosphatase families, protein domains, and gene ontology are also added into the database. P3DB not only provides rich information, but also interconnects and provides visualization of the data in networks, in systems biology context. Currently, P3DB includes the KiC (Kinase Client) assay network, the protein-protein interaction network, the kinase-substrate network, the phosphatase-substrate network, and the protein domain co-occurrence network. All of these are available to query for and visualize existing phosphorylation events. Although P3DB only hosts experimentally identified phosphorylation data, it provides a plant phosphorylation prediction model for any unknown queries on the fly.

To address this issue, we report DLGP (http://lcgbase.big.ac.cn/DLGP/) that stores the pre-calculated lineage-based gene pairs in currently available 134 animal and plant genomes and inspect them under the same analytical framework, bringing out a set of innovational features. First, the taxonomy or lineage has been classified into four levels such as Kingdom, Phylum, Class and Order. It adopts all-to-all comparison strategy to identify the possible conserved gene pairs in all species for each gene pair in certain species and reckon those that are conserved in over a significant proportion of species in a given lineage (e.g. Primates, Diptera or Poales) as the lineage-conserved gene pairs. Furthermore, it predicts the lineage-specific gene pairs by retaining the above-mentioned lineage-conserved gene pairs that are not conserved in any other lineages. Second, it carries out pairwise comparison for the gene pairs between two compared species and creates the table including all the conserved gene pairs and the image elucidating the conservation degree of gene pairs in chromosomal level. Third, it supplies gene order browser to extend gene pairs to gene clusters, allowing users to view the evolution dynamics in the gene context in an intuitive manner.

24408216,tbvar: A comprehensive genome variation resource for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, along with closely related species, commonly known as M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC), causes tuberculosis in humans and other organisms. Tuberculosis is a disease with high morbidity and mortality, especially in the third world. The genetic variability between clinical isolates of MTBC has been poorly understood, although recent years have seen the re-sequencing of a large number of clinical isolates of MTBC from around the world. The availability of genomic data of multiple isolates in public domain would potentially offer a unique opportunity toward understanding the variome of the organism and the functional consequences of the variations. This nevertheless has been limited by the lack of systematic curation and analysis of data sets available in public domain. In this report, we have re-analyzed re-sequencing data sets corresponding to >450 isolates of MTBC available in public domain to create a comprehensive variome map of MTBC comprising >29 000 single nucleotide variations. Using a systematic computational pipeline, we have annotated potential functional variants and drug-resistance-associated variants from the variome. We have made available this data set as a searchable database. Apart from a user-friendly interface, the database also has a novel option to annotate variants from clinical re-sequencing data sets of MTBC. To the best of our knowledge, tbvar is the largest and most comprehensive genome variation resources for MTBC.

27037912,GAMDB: a web resource to connect microRNAs with autophagy in gerontology.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ~23 nucleotides (nt) RNAs, regulating gene expression by pairing to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes to direct their post-transcriptional repression. Both in normal and aberrant activities, miRNAs contribute to a recurring paradigm of cellular behaviors in pathological settings, especially in gerontology. Autophagy, a multi-step lysosomal degradation process with function to degrade long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, has significant impact on gerontology. Thus, elucidating how miRNAs participate in autophagy may enlarge the scope of miRNA in autophagy and facilitate researches in gerontology.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Herein, based upon the published studies, predicted targets and gerontology-related diseases, we constructed a web resource named Gerontology-Autophagic-MicroRNA Database (GAMDB) (http://gamdb.liu-lab.com/index.php), which contained 836 autophagy-related miRNAs, 197 targeted genes/proteins and 56 aging-related diseases such as Parkinson' disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>We made use of large amounts of data to elucidate the intricate relationships between microRNA-regulated autophagic mechanisms and gerontology.

24339831,Circ2Traits: a comprehensive database for circular RNA potentially associated with disease and traits.,"Circular RNAs are new players in regulation of post transcriptional gene expression. Animal genomes express many circular RNAs from diverse genomic locations. A recent study has validated a fairly large number of circular RNAs in human, mouse, and nematode. Circular RNAs play a crucial role in fine tuning the level of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering the miRNAs. Their interaction with disease associated miRNAs indicates that circular RNAs are important for disease regulation. In this paper we studied the potential association of circular RNAs (circRNA) with human diseases in two different ways. Firstly, the interactions of circRNAs with disease associated miRNAs were identified, following which the likelihood of a circRNA being associated with a disease was calculated. For the miRNAs associated with individual diseases, we constructed a network of predicted interactions between the miRNAs and protein coding, long non-coding and circular RNA genes. We carried out gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the set of protein coding genes in the miRNA- circRNA interactome of individual diseases to check the enrichment of genes associated with particular biological processes. Secondly, disease associated SNPs were mapped on circRNA loci, and Argonaute (Ago) interaction sites on circular RNAs were identified.

Up to 70% of annotated genes in plants undergo APA. Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data. We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi.xmu.edu.cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants. PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions. Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing. In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation. More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets. To date, PlantAPA hosts the largest database of APA sites in plants, including Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

High heterozygosity combined with a long gestational period makes conventional breeding a cumbersome process. Therefore, marker-assisted breeding is a better alternative approach when compared with conventional breeding. Considering the large genome size of tea (~3 Gb), information about simple sequence repeat (SSR) is scanty. Thus, we have taken advantage of the recently published tea genomes to identify large numbers of SSR markers in the tea. Besides the genomic sequences, we identified SSRs from the other publicly available sequences such as RNA-seq, GSS, ESTs and organelle genomes (chloroplasts and mitochondrial) and also searched published literature to catalog validated set of tea SSR markers. The complete exercise yielded a total of 935 547 SSRs. Out of the total, 82 SSRs were selected for validation among a diverse set of tea genotypes. Six primers (each with four to six alleles, an average of five alleles per locus) out of the total 27 polymorphic primers were used for a diversity analysis in 36 tea genotypes with mean polymorphic information content of 0.61-0.76.

33653882,A Mycobacterial Systems Resource for the Research Community.,"Functional characterization of bacterial proteins lags far behind the identification of new protein families. This is especially true for bacterial species that are more difficult to grow and genetically manipulate than model systems such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> To facilitate functional characterization of mycobacterial proteins, we have established a Mycobacterial Systems Resource (MSR) using the model organism <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> This resource focuses specifically on 1,153 highly conserved core genes that are common to many mycobacterial species, including <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, in order to provide the most relevant information and resources for the mycobacterial research community. The MSR includes both biological and bioinformatic resources. The biological resource includes (i) an expression plasmid library of 1,116 genes fused to a fluorescent protein for determining protein localization; (ii) a library of 569 precise deletions of nonessential genes; and (iii) a set of 843 CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) plasmids specifically targeted to silence expression of essential core genes and genes for which a precise deletion was not obtained. The bioinformatic resource includes information about individual genes and a detailed assessment of protein localization. We anticipate that integration of these initial functional analyses and the availability of the biological resource will facilitate studies of these core proteins in many <i>Mycobacterium</i> species, including the less experimentally tractable pathogens <i>M. abscessus</i>, <i>M. avium</i>, <i>M. kansasii</i>, <i>M. leprae</i>, <i>M. marinum</i>, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, and <i>M. ulcerans</i><b>IMPORTANCE</b> Diseases caused by mycobacterial species result in millions of deaths per year globally, and present a substantial health and economic burden, especially in immunocompromised patients.

29688353,Fungal Stress Database (FSD)--a repository of fungal stress physiological data.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>The construction of the Fungal Stress Database (FSD) was initiated and fueled by two major goals. At first, some outstandingly important groups of filamentous fungi including the aspergilli possess remarkable capabilities to adapt to a wide spectrum of environmental stress conditions but the underlying mechanisms of this stress tolerance have remained yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, the lack of any satisfactory interlaboratory standardization of stress assays, e.g. the widely used stress agar plate experiments, often hinders the direct comparison and discussion of stress physiological data gained for various fungal species by different research groups. In order to overcome these difficulties and to promote multilevel, e.g. combined comparative physiology-based and comparative genomics-based, stress research in filamentous fungi, we constructed FSD, which currently stores 1412 photos taken on Aspergillus colonies grown under precisely defined stress conditions. This study involved altogether 18 Aspergillus strains representing 17 species with two different strains for Aspergillus niger and covered six different stress conditions. Stress treatments were selected considering the frequency of various stress tolerance studies published in the last decade in the aspergilli and included oxidative (H2O2, menadione sodium bisulphite), high-osmolarity (NaCl, sorbitol), cell wall integrity (Congo Red) and heavy metal (CdCl2) stress exposures. In the future, we would like to expand this database to accommodate further fungal species and stress treatments.

25058159,iRegulon: from a gene list to a gene regulatory network using large motif and track collections.,"Identifying master regulators of biological processes and mapping their downstream gene networks are key challenges in systems biology. We developed a computational method, called iRegulon, to reverse-engineer the transcriptional regulatory network underlying a co-expressed gene set using cis-regulatory sequence analysis. iRegulon implements a genome-wide ranking-and-recovery approach to detect enriched transcription factor motifs and their optimal sets of direct targets. We increase the accuracy of network inference by using very large motif collections of up to ten thousand position weight matrices collected from various species, and linking these to candidate human TFs via a motif2TF procedure. We validate iRegulon on gene sets derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data with increasing levels of noise, and we compare iRegulon with existing motif discovery methods. Next, we use iRegulon on more challenging types of gene lists, including microRNA target sets, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic perturbation data. In particular, we over-activate p53 in breast cancer cells, followed by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, and could identify an extensive up-regulated network controlled directly by p53. Similarly we map a repressive network with no indication of direct p53 regulation but rather an indirect effect via E2F and NFY. Finally, we generalize our computational framework to include regulatory tracks such as ChIP-seq data and show how motif and track discovery can be combined to map functional regulatory interactions among co-expressed genes. iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org.",False,True,,0.7133375,iregulon,,22.9935624,ok,,,encode,v2,0.9935624,iRegulon,True,True,True,,http://iregulon.aertslab.org,http://iregulon.aertslab.org,True,...iRegulon is available as a Cytoscape plugin from http://iregulon.aertslab.org.,1,False,False,False

The web-based Pathogen-annotated Tracking Resource Network (PATRN) system (www.patrn.net) was developed to address the data aggregation, analysis, and communication needs important to the global food safety community for the investigation of foodborne disease. PATRN incorporates a standard vocabulary for describing isolate metadata and provides a representational schema for a prototypic data exchange standard using a novel data loading wizard for aggregation of assay and attribution information. PATRN currently houses expert-curated, high-quality ""foundational datasets"" consisting of published experimental results from conventional assays and next generation analysis platforms for isolates of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio and Cronobacter species. A suite of computational tools for data mining, clustering, and graphical representation is available. Within PATRN, the public curated data repository is complemented by a secure private workspace for user-driven analyses, and for sharing data among collaborators. To demonstrate the data curation, loading wizard features, and analytical capabilities of PATRN, three use-case scenarios are presented. Use-case scenario one is a comparison of the distribution and prevalence of plasmid-encoded virulence factor genes among 249 Cronobacter strains with similar attributes to that of nine Cronobacter isolates from recent cases obtained between March and October, 2010-2011. To highlight PATRN's data management and trend finding tools, analysis of datasets, stored in PATRN as part of an ongoing surveillance project to identify the predominant molecular serogroups among Cronobacter sakazakii isolates observed in the USA is shown. Use-case scenario two demonstrates the secure workspace available for private users to upload and analyze sensitive data, and for collating cross-platform datasets to identify and validate congruent datapoints. SNP datasets from WGS assemblies and pan-genome microarrays are analyzed in a combinatorial fashion to determine relatedness of 33 Salmonella enterica strains to six strains collected as part of an outbreak investigation. Use-case scenario three utilizes published surveillance results that describe the incidence and sources of O157:H7 E. coli isolates associated with a produce pre-harvest surveillance study that occurred during 2002-2006.

However, a repository that houses all such ARD associations is lacking. The present work is aimed at filling this void. A database, dbAARD (database of Aging and Age Related Disorders) has been developed which hosts information on more than 3000 genetic variations significantly (p-value <0.05) associated with 51 ARDs. Furthermore, a machine learning based gene prediction tool AGP (Age Related Disorders Gene Prediction) has been constructed by employing rotation forest algorithm, to prioritize genes associated with ARDs.

However, with the increasing amenability of genetic disorders to diagnosis and better management, many previously underreported conditions are emerging as disorders of public health significance. In turn, the greater emphasis on noncommunicable disorders has generated a demand for comprehensive and relevant disease-based information from end-users, including clinicians, patients, genetic epidemiologists, health administrators and policymakers. To accommodate these demands, country-specific and disease-centric resources are required to complement the existing LSDBs and NEMDBs.

22672646,Biomine: predicting links between biological entities using network models of heterogeneous databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Biological databases contain large amounts of data concerning the functions and associations of genes and proteins. Integration of data from several such databases into a single repository can aid the discovery of previously unknown connections spanning multiple types of relationships and databases.<h4>Results</h4>Biomine is a system that integrates cross-references from several biological databases into a graph model with multiple types of edges, such as protein interactions, gene-disease associations and gene ontology annotations. Edges are weighted based on their type, reliability, and informativeness. We present Biomine and evaluate its performance in link prediction, where the goal is to predict pairs of nodes that will be connected in the future, based on current data. In particular, we formulate protein interaction prediction and disease gene prioritization tasks as instances of link prediction. The predictions are based on a proximity measure computed on the integrated graph. We consider and experiment with several such measures, and perform a parameter optimization procedure where different edge types are weighted to optimize link prediction accuracy. We also propose a novel method for disease-gene prioritization, defined as finding a subset of candidate genes that cluster together in the graph. We experimentally evaluate Biomine by predicting future annotations in the source databases and prioritizing lists of putative disease genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The experimental results show that Biomine has strong potential for predicting links when a set of selected candidate links is available. The predictions obtained using the entire Biomine dataset are shown to clearly outperform ones obtained using any single source of data alone, when different types of links are suitably weighted. In the gene prioritization task, an established reference set of disease-associated genes is useful, but the results show that under favorable conditions, Biomine can also perform well when no such information is available.The Biomine system is a proof of concept.

Since then thousands of application, articles and citation have proved 3-D QSAR as a valuable method to be used in drug design. Several other 3-D QSAR methods have appeared, but still CoMFA remains the most used and cited. Nevertheless from a survey on the Certara® web site it seems that CoMFA is no more available. Herein is presented a python implementation of the CoMFA (Py-CoMFA). Py-CoMFA is usable through the www.3d-qsar.com web applications suites portal by mean of any electronic device that can run a web browser. As benchmark, 30 different publicly available datasets were used to assess the Py-CoMFA usability and robustness. Comparisons with published results proved Py-COMFA to be in very good agreement with those obtained with the original CoMFA.

27246819,The BioHub Knowledge Base: Ontology and Repository for Sustainable Biosourcing.,"<h4>Background</h4>The motivation for the BioHub project is to create an Integrated Knowledge Management System (IKMS) that will enable chemists to source ingredients from bio-renewables, rather than from non-sustainable sources such as fossil oil and its derivatives.<h4>Method</h4>The BioHubKB is the data repository of the IKMS; it employs Semantic Web technologies, especially OWL, to host data about chemical transformations, bio-renewable feedstocks, co-product streams and their chemical components. Access to this knowledge base is provided to other modules within the IKMS through a set of RESTful web services, driven by SPARQL queries to a Sesame back-end. The BioHubKB re-uses several bio-ontologies and bespoke extensions, primarily for chemical feedstocks and products, to form its knowledge organisation schema.<h4>Results</h4>Parts of plants form feedstocks, while various processes generate co-product streams that contain certain chemicals. Both chemicals and transformations are associated with certain qualities, which the BioHubKB also attempts to capture. Of immediate commercial and industrial importance is to estimate the cost of particular sets of chemical transformations (leading to candidate surfactants) performed in sequence, and these costs too are captured. Data are sourced from companies' internal knowledge and document stores, and from the publicly available literature. Both text analytics and manual curation play their part in populating the ontology.

30217829,Observed Antibody Space: A Resource for Data Mining Next-Generation Sequencing of Antibody Repertoires.,"Abs are immune system proteins that recognize noxious molecules for elimination. Their sequence diversity and binding versatility have made Abs the primary class of biopharmaceuticals. Recently, it has become possible to query their immense natural diversity using next-generation sequencing of Ig gene repertoires (Ig-seq). However, Ig-seq outputs are currently fragmented across repositories and tend to be presented as raw nucleotide reads, which means nontrivial effort is required to reuse the data for analysis. To address this issue, we have collected Ig-seq outputs from 55 studies, covering more than half a billion Ab sequences across diverse immune states, organisms (primarily human and mouse), and individuals. We have sorted, cleaned, annotated, translated, and numbered these sequences and make the data available via our Observed Antibody Space (OAS) resource at http://antibodymap.org The data within OAS will be regularly updated with newly released Ig-seq datasets.

The location of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on TM proteins is associated with their functional roles in various cellular processes. Given the importance of PTMs in the functioning of TM proteins, this study developed topPTM (available online at http://topPTM.cse.yzu.edu.tw), a new dbPTM module that provides a public resource for identifying the functional PTM sites on TM proteins with structural topology. Experimentally verified TM topology data were integrated from TMPad, TOPDB, PDBTM and OPM. In addition to the PTMs obtained from dbPTM, experimentally verified PTM sites were manually extracted from research articles by text mining. In an attempt to provide a full investigation of PTM sites on TM proteins, all UniProtKB protein entries containing annotations related to membrane localization and TM topology were considered potential TM proteins. Two effective tools were then used to annotate the structural topology of the potential TM proteins. The TM topology of TM proteins is represented by graphical visualization, as well as by the PTM sites. To delineate the structural correlation between the PTM sites and TM topologies, the tertiary structure of PTM sites on TM proteins was visualized by Jmol program. Given the support of research articles by manual curation and the investigation of domain-domain interactions in Protein Data Bank, 1347 PTM substrate sites are associated with protein-protein interactions for 773 TM proteins.

23283513,EuLoc: a web-server for accurately predict protein subcellular localization in eukaryotes by incorporating various features of sequence segments into the general form of Chou's PseAAC.,"The function of a protein is generally related to its subcellular localization. Therefore, knowing its subcellular localization is helpful in understanding its potential functions and roles in biological processes. This work develops a hybrid method for computationally predicting the subcellular localization of eukaryotic protein. The method is called EuLoc and incorporates the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method, homology search approach and the support vector machines (SVM) method by fusing several new features into Chou's pseudo-amino acid composition. The proposed SVM module overcomes the shortcoming of the homology search approach in predicting the subcellular localization of a protein which only finds low-homologous or non-homologous sequences in a protein subcellular localization annotated database. The proposed HMM modules overcome the shortcoming of SVM in predicting subcellular localizations using few data on protein sequences. Several features of a protein sequence are considered, including the sequence-based features, the biological features derived from PROSITE, NLSdb and Pfam, the post-transcriptional modification features and others. The overall accuracy and location accuracy of EuLoc are 90.5 and 91.2 %, respectively, revealing a better predictive performance than obtained elsewhere. Although the amounts of data of the various subcellular location groups in benchmark dataset differ markedly, the accuracies of 12 subcellular localizations of EuLoc range from 82.5 to 100 %, indicating that this tool is much more balanced than other tools. EuLoc offers a high, balanced predictive power for each subcellular localization.

It compiles the structural information related to orthosteric inhibitors and their target [i.e. related 3D structures available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)] and provides links to other useful databases. 2P2Idb includes all interactions for which both the protein-protein and protein-inhibitor complexes have been structurally characterized. Since its first release in 2010, the database has grown constantly and the current version contains 27 protein-protein complexes and 274 protein-inhibitor complexes corresponding to 242 unique small molecule inhibitors which represent almost a 5-fold increase compared to the previous version. A number of new data have been added, including new protein-protein complexes, binding affinities, molecular descriptors, precalculated interface parameters and links to other webservers. A new query tool has been implemented to search for inhibitors within the database using standard molecular descriptors. A novel version of the 2P2I-inspector tool has been implemented to calculate a series of physical and chemical parameters of the protein interfaces. Several geometrical parameters including planarity, eccentricity and circularity have been added as well as customizable distance cutoffs. This tool has also been extended to protein-ligand interfaces.

21474551,CycADS: an annotation database system to ease the development and update of BioCyc databases.,"In recent years, genomes from an increasing number of organisms have been sequenced, but their annotation remains a time-consuming process. The BioCyc databases offer a framework for the integrated analysis of metabolic networks. The Pathway tool software suite allows the automated construction of a database starting from an annotated genome, but it requires prior integration of all annotations into a specific summary file or into a GenBank file. To allow the easy creation and update of a BioCyc database starting from the multiple genome annotation resources available over time, we have developed an ad hoc data management system that we called Cyc Annotation Database System (CycADS). CycADS is centred on a specific database model and on a set of Java programs to import, filter and export relevant information. Data from GenBank and other annotation sources (including for example: KAAS, PRIAM, Blast2GO and PhylomeDB) are collected into a database to be subsequently filtered and extracted to generate a complete annotation file. This file is then used to build an enriched BioCyc database using the PathoLogic program of Pathway Tools. The CycADS pipeline for annotation management was used to build the AcypiCyc database for the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) whose genome was recently sequenced. The AcypiCyc database webpage includes also, for comparative analyses, two other metabolic reconstruction BioCyc databases generated using CycADS: TricaCyc for Tribolium castaneum and DromeCyc for Drosophila melanogaster. Linked to its flexible design, CycADS offers a powerful software tool for the generation and regular updating of enriched BioCyc databases. The CycADS system is particularly suited for metabolic gene annotation and network reconstruction in newly sequenced genomes. Because of the uniform annotation used for metabolic network reconstruction, CycADS is particularly useful for comparative analysis of the metabolism of different organisms.

Genetic mapping has been conducted in intraspecific crosses of onion (Allium cepa L.), A. fistulosum and interspecific crosses between A. roylei and these two species, but it has not been possible to access genetic maps and underlying data from these studies easily.<h4>Description</h4>An online comparative genomics database, AlliumMap, has been developed based on the GMOD CMap tool at http://alliumgenetics.org. It has been populated with curated data linking genetic maps with underlying markers and sequence data from multiple studies. It includes data from multiple onion mapping populations as well as the most closely related species A. roylei and A. fistulosum. Further onion EST-derived markers were evaluated in the A. cepa x A. roylei interspecific population, enabling merging of the AFLP-based maps. In addition, data concerning markers assigned in multiple studies to the Allium physical map using A. cepa-A. fistulosum alien monosomic addition lines have been compiled. The compiled data reveal extensive synteny between onion and A. fistulosum.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The database provides the first online resource providing genetic map and marker data from multiple Allium species and populations. The additional markers placed on the interspecific Allium map confirm the value of A. roylei as a valuable bridge between the genetics of onion and A. fistulosum and as a means to conduct efficient mapping of expressed sequence markers in Allium.

Quantitative data are available for each protein according to their accumulation profile during the germination process. These proteins can be retrieved either in list format or directly on scanned 2DE maps. These proteomic data reveal that 40% of seed proteins maintain a stable abundance over germination, up to radicle protrusion. During sensu stricto germination (24 h upon imbibition) about 50% of the proteins display quantitative variations, exhibiting an increased abundance (35%) or a decreasing abundance (15%). Moreover, during radicle protrusion (24-48 h upon imbibition), 41% proteins display quantitative variations with an increased (23%) or a decreasing abundance (18%). In addition, an analysis of the seed proteome revealed the importance of protein post-translational modifications as demonstrated by the poor correlation (r(2) = 0.29) between the theoretical (predicted from Arabidopsis genome) and the observed protein isoelectric points. Secondly, the SPWP is a relevant technical resource for protocols specifically dedicated to Arabidopsis seed proteome studies.

28830355,"The porcine translational research database: a manually curated, genomics and proteomics-based research resource.","<h4>Background</h4>The use of swine in biomedical research has increased dramatically in the last decade. Diverse genomic- and proteomic databases have been developed to facilitate research using human and rodent models. Current porcine gene databases, however, lack the robust annotation to study pig models that are relevant to human studies and for comparative evaluation with rodent models. Furthermore, they contain a significant number of errors due to their primary reliance on machine-based annotation. To address these deficiencies, a comprehensive literature-based survey was conducted to identify certain selected genes that have demonstrated function in humans, mice or pigs.<h4>Results</h4>The process identified 13,054 candidate human, bovine, mouse or rat genes/proteins used to select potential porcine homologs by searching multiple online sources of porcine gene information.

32369809,Introducing the Bird Chromosome Database: An Overview of Cytogenetic Studies in Birds.,"Bird chromosomes, which have been investigated scientifically for more than a century, present a number of unique features. In general, bird karyotypes have a high diploid number (2n) of typically around 80 chromosomes that are divided into macro- and microchromosomes. In recent decades, FISH studies using whole chromosome painting probes have shown that the macrochromosomes evolved through both inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements. However, chromosome painting data are available for only a few bird species, which hinders a more systematic approach to the understanding of the evolutionary history of the enigmatic bird karyotype. Thus, we decided to create an innovative database through compilation of the cytogenetic data available for birds, including chromosome numbers and the results of chromosome painting with chicken (Gallus gallus) probes. The data were obtained through an extensive literature review, which focused on cytogenetic studies published up to 2019. In the first version of the ""Bird Chromosome Database (BCD)"" (https://sites.unipampa.edu.br/birdchromosomedatabase) we have compiled data on the chromosome numbers of 1,067 bird species and chromosome painting data on 96 species. We found considerable variation in the diploid numbers, which ranged from 40 to 142, although most (around 50%) of the species studied up to now have between 78 and 82 chromosomes. Despite its importance for cytogenetic research, chromosome painting has been applied to less than 1% of all bird species.

Each gene page provides detailed information about its resistance mechanisms, while antibiotic page consists of summary, chemical description and structural descriptors with links to external public databases like GO, CDD, DEG, Ecocyc, KEGG, Drug Bank, PubChem and UniProt. Moreover, the database integrates this reductive information to holistic data such as strain-specific and segment-specific pathogenic islands and operons. In addition, the database offers rich user interface for the visualisation and retrieval of information using various search criteria such as sequence, keyword, image and class search.<h4>Conclusions</h4>u-CARE is aimed to cater to the needs of researchers working in the field of antimicrobial drug resistance with minimal knowledge of bioinformatics.

23893746,FlyPrimerBank: an online database for Drosophila melanogaster gene expression analysis and knockdown evaluation of RNAi reagents.,"The evaluation of specific endogenous transcript levels is important for understanding transcriptional regulation. More specifically, it is useful for independent confirmation of results obtained by the use of microarray analysis or RNA-seq and for evaluating RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown. Designing specific and effective primers for high-quality, moderate-throughput evaluation of transcript levels, i.e., quantitative, real-time PCR (qPCR), is nontrivial. To meet community needs, predefined qPCR primer pairs for mammalian genes have been designed and sequences made available, e.g., via PrimerBank. In this work, we adapted and refined the algorithms used for the mammalian PrimerBank to design 45,417 primer pairs for 13,860 Drosophila melanogaster genes, with three or more primer pairs per gene. We experimentally validated primer pairs for ~300 randomly selected genes expressed in early Drosophila embryos, using SYBR Green-based qPCR and sequence analysis of products derived from conventional PCR. All relevant information, including primer sequences, isoform specificity, spatial transcript targeting, and any available validation results and/or user feedback, is available from an online database (www.flyrnai.org/flyprimerbank). At FlyPrimerBank, researchers can retrieve primer information for fly genes either one gene at a time or in batch mode. Importantly, we included the overlap of each predicted amplified sequence with RNAi reagents from several public resources, making it possible for researchers to choose primers suitable for knockdown evaluation of RNAi reagents (i.e., to avoid amplification of the RNAi reagent itself).

22942020,Assignment of protein sequences to existing domain and family classification systems: Pfam and the PDB.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Automating the assignment of existing domain and protein family classifications to new sets of sequences is an important task. Current methods often miss assignments because remote relationships fail to achieve statistical significance. Some assignments are not as long as the actual domain definitions because local alignment methods often cut alignments short. Long insertions in query sequences often erroneously result in two copies of the domain assigned to the query. Divergent repeat sequences in proteins are often missed.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a multilevel procedure to produce nearly complete assignments of protein families of an existing classification system to a large set of sequences. We apply this to the task of assigning Pfam domains to sequences and structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We found that HHsearch alignments frequently scored more remotely related Pfams in Pfam clans higher than closely related Pfams, thus, leading to erroneous assignment at the Pfam family level. A greedy algorithm allowing for partial overlaps was, thus, applied first to sequence/HMM alignments, then HMM-HMM alignments and then structure alignments, taking care to join partial alignments split by large insertions into single-domain assignments. Additional assignment of repeat Pfams with weaker E-values was allowed after stronger assignments of the repeat HMM. Our database of assignments, presented in a database called PDBfam, contains Pfams for 99.4% of chains >50 residues.<h4>Availability</h4>The Pfam assignment data in PDBfam are available at http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/ProtCid/PDBfam, which can be searched by PDB codes and Pfam identifiers.

In a previous in vitro study using mass spectrometry, we identified 43 proteins that interact with histatin 1. Six previously documented interactors were confirmed and 37 novel partners were identified. In this tutorial, we aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of the STRING database for studying protein-protein interactions.

However, numerous environmental contaminants also find their way into human milk, making up the major part of a newborn's external exposome. While there are chemical regulations in India and scientific literature on environmental contaminants is available, the systematic compilation, monitoring, and risk management of human milk contaminants are inadequate. We have harnessed the potential of this large body of literature to develop the Exposome of Human Milk across India (ExHuMId) version 1.0 containing detailed information on 101 environmental contaminants detected in human milk samples across 13 Indian states, compiled from 36 research articles. ExHuMId also compiles the detected concentrations of the contaminants, structural and physicochemical properties, and factors associated with the donor of the sample. We also present findings from a three-pronged analysis of ExHuMId and two other resources on human milk contaminants, with a focus on the Indian scenario. Through a comparative analysis with global chemical regulations and guidelines, we identify human milk contaminants of high concern, such as potential carcinogens, endocrine disruptors and neurotoxins. We then study the physicochemical properties of the contaminants to gain insights on their propensity to transfer into human milk. Lastly, we employ a systems biology approach to shed light on potential effects of human milk contaminants on maternal and infant health, by identifying contaminant-gene interactions associated with lactation, cytokine signalling and production, and protein-mediated transport.

26010234,SEGEL: A Web Server for Visualization of Smoking Effects on Human Lung Gene Expression.,"Cigarette smoking is a major cause of death worldwide resulting in over six million deaths per year. Cigarette smoke contains complex mixtures of chemicals that are harmful to nearly all organs of the human body, especially the lungs. Cigarette smoking is considered the major risk factor for many lung diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and lung cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of smoking-induced lung injury associated with these lung diseases still remain largely unknown. Expression microarray techniques have been widely applied to detect the effects of smoking on gene expression in different human cells in the lungs. These projects have provided a lot of useful information for researchers to understand the potential molecular mechanism(s) of smoke-induced pathogenesis. However, a user-friendly web server that would allow scientists to fast query these data sets and compare the smoking effects on gene expression across different cells had not yet been established. For that reason, we have integrated eight public expression microarray data sets from trachea epithelial cells, large airway epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophage into an online web server called SEGEL (Smoking Effects on Gene Expression of Lung). Users can query gene expression patterns across these cells from smokers and nonsmokers by gene symbols, and find the effects of smoking on the gene expression of lungs from this web server. Sex difference in response to smoking is also shown. The relationship between the gene expression and cigarette smoking consumption were calculated and are shown in the server. The current version of SEGEL web server contains 42,400 annotated gene probe sets represented on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 platform.

The eHOMD provides well-curated 16S rRNA gene reference sequences linked to available genomes and enables assignment of species-level taxonomy to most next-generation sequences derived from diverse aerodigestive tract sites, including the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth. Using minimum entropy decomposition coupled with the RDP Classifier and our eHOMD V1-V3 training set, we reanalyzed 16S rRNA V1-V3 sequences from the nostrils of 210 Human Microbiome Project participants at the species level, revealing four key insights. First, we discovered that Lawsonella clevelandensis, a recently named bacterium, and <i>Neisseriaceae</i> [G-1] HMT-174, a previously unrecognized bacterium, are common in adult nostrils. Second, just 19 species accounted for 90% of the total sequences from all participants. Third, 1 of these 19 species belonged to a currently uncultivated genus. Fourth, for 94% of the participants, 2 to 10 species constituted 90% of their sequences, indicating that the nostril microbiome may be represented by limited consortia. These insights highlight the strengths of the nostril microbiome as a model system for studying interspecies interactions and microbiome function. Also, in this cohort, three common nasal species (Dolosigranulum pigrum and two <i>Corynebacterium</i> species) showed positive differential abundance when the pathobiont Staphylococcus aureus was absent, generating hypotheses regarding colonization resistance. By facilitating species-level taxonomic assignment to microbes from the human aerodigestive tract, the eHOMD is a vital resource enhancing clinical relevance of microbiome studies. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The eHOMD (http://www.ehomd.org) is a valuable resource for researchers, from basic to clinical, who study the microbiomes and the individual microbes in body sites in the human aerodigestive tract, which includes the nasal passages, sinuses, throat, esophagus, and mouth, and the lower respiratory tract, in health and disease.

Gephebase aims to compile studies where the genotype-phenotype association (based on linkage mapping, association mapping or a candidate gene approach) is relatively well supported. Human clinical traits and aberrant mutant phenotypes in laboratory organisms are not included and can be found in other databases (e.g. OMIM, OMIA, Monarch Initiative). Gephebase contains more than 1700 entries. Each entry corresponds to an allelic difference at a given gene and its associated phenotypic change(s) between two species or two individuals of the same species, and is enriched with molecular details, taxonomic information, and bibliographic information. Users can easily browse entries and perform searches at various levels using boolean operators (e.g. transposable elements, snakes, carotenoid content, Doebley). Data is exportable in spreadsheet format. This database allows to perform meta-analyses to extract global trends about the living world and the research fields. Gephebase should also help breeders, conservationists and others to identify promising target genes for crop improvement, parasite/pest control, bioconservation and genetic diagnostic.

In the latest version, H-InvDB 8.0, a total of 244 709 human complementary DNA was mapped onto the hg19 reference genome and 43 829 gene loci, including nonprotein-coding ones, were identified. Of these loci, 35 631 were identified as potential protein-coding genes, and 22 898 of these were identical to known genes. In our analysis, 19 309 annotated genes were specific to H-InvDB and not found in RefSeq and Ensembl. In fact, 233 genes of the 19 309 turned out to have protein functions in this version of H-InvDB; they were annotated as unknown protein functions in the previous version. Furthermore, 11 genes were identified as known Mendelian disorder genes. It is advantageous that many biologically functional genes are hidden in the H-InvDB unique genes. As large-scale proteomic projects have been conducted to elucidate the functions of all human proteins, we have enhanced the proteomic information with an advanced protein view and new subdatabase of protein complexes (Protein Complex Database with quality index).

22084200,AH-DB: collecting protein structure pairs before and after binding.,"This work presents the Apo-Holo DataBase (AH-DB, http://ahdb.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ and http://ahdb.csbb.ntu.edu.tw/), which provides corresponding pairs of protein structures before and after binding. Conformational transitions are commonly observed in various protein interactions that are involved in important biological functions. For example, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which destroys free superoxide radicals in the body, undergoes a large conformational transition from an 'open' state (apo structure) to a 'closed' state (holo structure). Many studies have utilized collections of apo-holo structure pairs to investigate the conformational transitions and critical residues. However, the collection process is usually complicated, varies from study to study and produces a small-scale data set. AH-DB is designed to provide an easy and unified way to prepare such data, which is generated by identifying/mapping molecules in different Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries. Conformational transitions are identified based on a refined alignment scheme to overcome the challenge that many structures in the PDB database are only protein fragments and not complete proteins. There are 746,314 apo-holo pairs in AH-DB, which is about 30 times those in the second largest collection of similar data. AH-DB provides sophisticated interfaces for searching apo-holo structure pairs and exploring conformational transitions from apo structures to the corresponding holo structures.",False,True,,0.7244042,,ah-db,20.9976598,ok,,apo-holo database,pdb,v2,0.9976598,AH-DB,True,True,True,AH-DB,http://ahdb.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ | http://ahdb.csbb.ntu.edu.tw/,http://ahdb.ee.ncku.edu.tw/,True,"This work presents the Apo-Holo DataBase (AH-DB, http://ahdb.ee.ncku.edu.tw/ and http://ahdb.csbb.ntu.edu.tw/), which provides...",1,True,True,True
34415997,The Breeding Information Management System (BIMS): an online resource for crop breeding.,"In this era of big data, breeding programs are producing ever larger amounts of data. This necessitates access to efficient management systems to keep track of cross, performance, pedigree, geographical and image-based data, as well as genotyping data. In this article, we report the progress on the Breeding Information Management System (BIMS), a free, secure and online breeding management system that allows breeders to store, manage, archive and analyze their private breeding data. BIMS is the first publicly available database system that enables individual breeders to integrate their private phenotypic and genotypic data with public data and, at the same time, have complete control of their own breeding data along with access to tools such as data import/export, data analysis and data archiving. The integration of breeding data with publicly available genomic and genetic data enhances genetic understanding of important traits and maximizes the marker-assisted breeding utility for breeders and allied scientists. BIMS incorporates the use of the Android App Field Book, open-source phenotype data collection software for phones and tablets that allows breeders to replace hard copy field books, thus alleviating the possibility of transcription errors while providing faster access to the collected data. BIMS comes with training materials and support for individual or small group training and is currently implemented in the Genome Database for Rosaceae, CottonGEN, the Citrus Genome Database, the Pulse Crop Database, and the Genome Database for Vaccinium.

However, the comparison of morphological and genetic data is sometimes hindered by the lack of cultures of several cyanobacterial morphospecies and inadequate morphological data of sequenced strains (Rajaniemi et al. 2005). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity within defined taxa, the variability observed in cultures has to be compared to the range in natural variation (Komárek and Mareš 2012). Thus, new tools are needed to aggregate, link and process data in a meaningful way, in order to properly study and understand cyanodiversity.<h4>New information</h4>An online database on cyanobacteria has been created, namely the Cyanobacteria culture collection (CCC) (http://cyanobacteria.myspecies.info/) using as case studies cyanobacterial strains isolated from lakes of Greece, which are part of the AUTH culture collection (School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki).

It is able to rank submitted structural models of a protein through an explicit use of evolutionary information, a criterion differing from structural or energetic considerations commonly used in other assessment programs. The idea behind BeEP (Best Evolutionary Pattern) is to benefit from the substitution pattern derived from structural constraints present in a set of homologous proteins adopting a given protein conformation. The BeEP method uses a model of protein evolution that takes into account the structure of a protein to build site-specific substitution matrices. The suitability of these substitution matrices is assessed through maximum likelihood calculations from which position-specific and global scores can be derived. These scores estimate how well the structural constraints derived from each structural model are represented in a sequence alignment of homologous proteins. Our assessment on a subset of proteins from the Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment has shown that BeEP is capable of discriminating the models and selecting one or more native-like structures.

COVID-ONE-hi is based on the data that contain the IgG/IgM responses to 24 full-length/truncated proteins corresponding to 20 of 28 known SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 199 spike protein peptides against 2360 serum samples collected from 783 COVID-19 patients. In addition, 96 clinical parameters for the 2360 serum samples and basic information for the 783 patients are integrated into the database. Furthermore, COVID-ONE-hi provides a dashboard for defining samples and a one-click analysis pipeline for a single group or paired groups. A set of samples of interest is easily defined by adjusting the scale bars of a variety of parameters. After the ""START"" button is clicked, one can readily obtain a comprehensive analysis report for further interpretation.

31125569,Updates to Binding MOAD (Mother of All Databases): Polypharmacology Tools and Their Utility in Drug Repurposing.,"The goal of Binding MOAD is to provide users with a data set focused on high-quality x-ray crystal structures that have been solved with biologically relevant ligands bound. Where available, experimental binding affinities (K<sub>a</sub>, K<sub>d</sub>, K<sub>i</sub>, IC<sub>50</sub>) are provided from the primary literature of the crystal structure. The database has been updated regularly since 2005, and this most recent update has added nearly 7000 new structures (growth of 21%). MOAD currently contains 32,747 structures, composed of 9117 protein families and 16,044 unique ligands. The data are freely available on www.BindingMOAD.org. This paper outlines updates to the data in Binding MOAD as well as improvements made to both the website and its contents. The NGL viewer has been added to improve visualization of the ligands and protein structures. MarvinJS has been implemented, over the outdated MarvinView, to work with JChem for small molecule searching in the database. To add tools for predicting polypharmacology, we have added information about sequence, binding-site, and ligand similarity between entries in the database. A main premise behind polypharmacology is that similar binding sites will bind similar ligands. The large amount of protein-ligand information available in Binding MOAD allows us to compute pairwise ligand and binding-site similarities. Lists of similar ligands and similar binding sites have been added to allow users to identify potential polypharmacology pairs. To show the utility of the polypharmacology data, we detail a few examples from Binding MOAD of drug repurposing targets with their respective similarities.",False,True,,0.72432417,,moad,20.96376806,ok,,binding moad | marvinjs,,v2,0.96376806,Updates to Binding MOAD,True,False,False,,http://www.BindingMOAD.org,http://www.BindingMOAD.org,True,,1,False,False,False

However, the Middle Eastern population is underrepresented in current databases. Accordingly, we established Iranome database (www.iranome.com) by performing whole exome sequencing on 800 individuals from eight major Iranian ethnic groups representing the second largest population of Middle East. We identified 1,575,702 variants of which 308,311 were novel (19.6%). Also, by presenting higher frequency for 37,384 novel or known rare variants, Iranome database can improve the power of molecular diagnosis. Moreover, attainable clinical information makes this database a good resource for classifying pathogenicity of rare variants. Principal components analysis indicated that, apart from Iranian-Baluchs, Iranian-Turkmen, and Iranian-Persian Gulf Islanders, who form their own clusters, rest of the population were genetically linked, forming a super-population. Furthermore, only 0.6% of novel variants showed counterparts in ""Greater Middle East Variome Project"", emphasizing the value of Iranome at national level by releasing a comprehensive catalog of Iranian genomic variations and also filling another gap in the catalog of human genome variations at international level.

Here, to comprehensively identify protein complexes in photosynthetic organisms, we applied the recently developed approach of blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) coupled with LC-MS/MS to the thylakoid proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana and the whole cell proteins of whole cell proteins of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We identified 245 proteins from the purified Arabidopsis thylakoid membranes and 1,458 proteins from the whole cells of Synechocystis using the method. Next, we generated protein migration profiles that were assessed by plotting the label-free estimations of protein abundances versus migration distance in BN-PAGE. Comparisons between the migration profiles of the major photosynthetic complexes and their band patterns showed that the protein migration profiles were well correlated. Thus, the protein migration profiles allowed us to estimate the molecular size of each protein complex and to identify co-migrated proteins with the proteins of interest by determining the protein pairs that contained peaks in the same gel slice. Finally, we built the protein co-migration database for photosynthetic organisms (PCoM-DB: http://pcomdb.lowtem.hokudai.ac.jp/proteins/top) to make our data publicly accessible online, which stores the analyzed data with a user-friendly interface to compare the migration profiles of proteins of interest.

24574116,MGDB: crossing the marker genes of a user microarray with a database of public-microarrays marker genes.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The microarrays performed by scientific teams grow exponentially. These microarray data could be useful for researchers around the world, but unfortunately they are underused. To fully exploit these data, it is necessary (i) to extract these data from a repository of the high-throughput gene expression data like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and (ii) to make the data from different microarrays comparable with tools easy to use for scientists. We have developed these two solutions in our server, implementing a database of microarray marker genes (Marker Genes Data Base). This database contains the marker genes of all GEO microarray datasets and it is updated monthly with the new microarrays from GEO. Thus, researchers can see whether the marker genes of their microarray are marker genes in other microarrays in the database, expanding the analysis of their microarray to the rest of the public microarrays. This solution helps not only to corroborate the conclusions regarding a researcher's microarray but also to identify the phenotype of different subsets of individuals under investigation, to frame the results with microarray experiments from other species, pathologies or tissues, to search for drugs that promote the transition between the studied phenotypes, to detect undesirable side effects of the treatment applied, etc. Thus, the researcher can quickly add relevant information to his/her studies from all of the previous analyses performed in other studies as long as they have been deposited in public repositories.<h4>Availability</h4>Marker-gene database tool: http://ibb.uab.es/mgdb",False,True,,0.71974105,,mgdb,20.87216043,ok,geo | gene expression omnibus,gene expression omnibus | arker genes data base | ene database,geo,spacy+v2,0.87216043,MGDB,True,True,True,MGDB,http://ibb.uab.es/mgdb,http://ibb.uab.es/mgdb,True,...s.<h4>Availability</h4>Marker-gene database tool: http://ibb.uab.es/mgdb,1,False,True,True

31506471,ePath: an online database towards comprehensive essential gene annotation for prokaryotes.,"Experimental techniques for identification of essential genes (EGs) in prokaryotes are usually expensive, time-consuming and sometimes unrealistic. Emerging in silico methods provide alternative methods for EG prediction, but often possess limitations including heavy computational requirements and lack of biological explanation. Here we propose a new computational algorithm for EG prediction in prokaryotes with an online database (ePath) for quick access to the EG prediction results of over 4,000 prokaryotes ( https://www.pubapps.vcu.edu/epath/ ). In ePath, gene essentiality is linked to biological functions annotated by KEGG Ortholog (KO). Two new scoring systems, namely, E_score and P_score, are proposed for each KO as the EG evaluation criteria. E_score represents appearance and essentiality of a given KO in existing experimental results of gene essentiality, while P_score denotes gene essentiality based on the principle that a gene is essential if it plays a role in genetic information processing, cell envelope maintenance or energy production. The new EG prediction algorithm shows prediction accuracy ranging from 75% to 91% based on validation from five new experimental studies on EG identification.

Nearly a decade ago, the 12 Drosophila genomes project expanded D. melanogaster's breadth as a comparative model through the community-development of an unprecedented genus- and genome-wide comparative resource. However, since its inception, these datasets for evolutionary inference and biological discovery have become increasingly outdated, outmoded, and inaccessible. Here, we provide an updated and upgradable comparative genomics resource of Drosophila divergence and selection, flyDIVaS, based on the latest genomic assemblies, curated FlyBase annotations, and recent OrthoDB orthology calls. flyDIVaS is an online database containing D. melanogaster-centric orthologous gene sets, CDS and protein alignments, divergence statistics (% gaps, dN, dS, dN/dS), and codon-based tests of positive Darwinian selection. Out of 13,920 protein-coding D. melanogaster genes, ∼80% have one aligned ortholog in the closely related species, D. simulans, and ∼50% have 1-1 12-way alignments in the original 12 sequenced species that span over 80 million yr of divergence. Genes and their orthologs can be chosen from four different taxonomic datasets differing in phylogenetic depth and coverage density, and visualized via interactive alignments and phylogenetic trees. Users can also batch download entire comparative datasets. A functional survey finds conserved mitotic and neural genes, highly diverged immune and reproduction-related genes, more conspicuous signals of divergence across tissue-specific genes, and an enrichment of positive selection among highly diverged genes. flyDIVaS will be regularly updated and can be freely accessed at www.flydivas.info We encourage researchers to regularly use this resource as a tool for biological inference and discovery, and in their classrooms to help train the next generation of biologists to creatively use such genomic big data resources in an integrative manner.",False,True,,0.7212183,flydivas,,19.99907255,ok,,flybase | orthodb,,v2,0.99907255,flyDIVaS,True,True,True,,http://www.flydivas.info,http://www.flydivas.info,True,,1,False,False,False
31032841,YeasTSS: an integrative web database of yeast transcription start sites.,"The transcription initiation landscape of eukaryotic genes is complex and highly dynamic. In eukaryotes, genes can generate multiple transcript variants that differ in 5' boundaries due to usages of alternative transcription start sites (TSSs), and the abundance of transcript isoforms are highly variable. Due to a large number and complexity of the TSSs, it is not feasible to depict details of transcript initiation landscape of all genes using text-format genome annotation files. Therefore, it is necessary to provide data visualization of TSSs to represent quantitative TSS maps and the core promoters (CPs). In addition, the selection and activity of TSSs are influenced by various factors, such as transcription factors, chromatin remodeling and histone modifications. Thus, integration and visualization of functional genomic data related to these features could provide a better understanding of the gene promoter architecture and regulatory mechanism of transcription initiation. Yeast species play important roles for the research and human society, yet no database provides visualization and integration of functional genomic data in yeast. Here, we generated quantitative TSS maps for 12 important yeast species, inferred their CPs and built a public database, YeasTSS (www.yeastss.org).

As the number of specific and validated affinity reagents that target this subproteome are limited, mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches will continue to play a critical role in enabling discovery and quantitation of these molecules. Given the technical considerations that make MS-based cell surface proteome studies uniquely challenging, it can be difficult to select an appropriate experimental approach. To this end, we have integrated multiple prediction strategies and annotations into a single online resource, <i>C</i>ompiled <i>I</i>nteractive <i>R</i>esource <i>f</i>or <i>E</i>xtracellular and <i>S</i>urface <i>S</i>tudies (CIRFESS). CIRFESS enables rapid interrogation of the human proteome to reveal the cell surface proteome theoretically detectable by current approaches and highlights where current prediction strategies provide concordant and discordant information. We applied CIRFESS to identify the percentage of various subsets of the proteome which are expected to be captured by targeted enrichment strategies, including two established methods and one that is possible but not yet demonstrated. These results will inform the selection of available proteomic strategies and development of new strategies to enhance coverage of the cell surface and extracellular proteome.

A total of 534 complete chloroplast genome sequences (as on 18 September 2014) of Viridiplantae are available at NCBI organelle genome resource. It provides opportunity to mine these genomes for the detection of SSRs and store them in the form of a database. In an attempt to properly manage and retrieve chloroplastic SSRs, we designed ChloroSSRdb which is a relational database developed using SQL server 2008 and accessed through ASP.NET. It provides information of all the three types (perfect, imperfect and compound) of SSRs. At present, ChloroSSRdb contains 124 430 mined SSRs, with majority lying in non-coding region. Out of these, PCR primers were designed for 118 249 SSRs. Tetranucleotide repeats (47 079) were found to be the most frequent repeat type, whereas hexanucleotide repeats (6414) being the least abundant. Additionally, in each species statistical analyses were performed to calculate relative frequency, correlation coefficient and chi-square statistics of perfect and imperfect SSRs. In accordance with the growing interest in SSR studies, ChloroSSRdb will prove to be a useful resource in developing genetic markers, phylogenetic analysis, genetic mapping, etc. Moreover, it will serve as a ready reference for mined SSRs in available chloroplast genomes of green plants.

27318307,Comprehensive analysis of the N-glycan biosynthetic pathway using bioinformatics to generate UniCorn: A theoretical N-glycan structure database.,"Glycan structures attached to proteins are comprised of diverse monosaccharide sequences and linkages that are produced from precursor nucleotide-sugars by a series of glycosyltransferases. Databases of these structures are an essential resource for the interpretation of analytical data and the development of bioinformatics tools. However, with no template to predict what structures are possible the human glycan structure databases are incomplete and rely heavily on the curation of published, experimentally determined, glycan structure data. In this work, a library of 45 human glycosyltransferases was used to generate a theoretical database of N-glycan structures comprised of 15 or less monosaccharide residues. Enzyme specificities were sourced from major online databases including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Glycan, Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy), GlycoGene DataBase (GGDB) and BRENDA. Based on the known activities, more than 1.1 million theoretical structures and 4.7 million synthetic reactions were generated and stored in our database called UniCorn. Furthermore, we analyzed the differences between the predicted glycan structures in UniCorn and those contained in UniCarbKB (www.unicarbkb.org), a database which stores experimentally described glycan structures reported in the literature, and demonstrate that UniCorn can be used to aid in the assignment of ambiguous structures whilst also serving as a discovery database.",False,True,,0.7065806,unicorn,,19.99788594,ok,,kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes | unicarbkb,kegg | cazy | ggdb | brenda,v2,0.99788594,Comprehensive analysis of the N-glycan biosynthetic pathway using bioinformatics to generate UniCorn,True,False,False,,http://www.unicarbkb.org,http://www.unicarbkb.org,True,,1,False,False,False

Low cost, ease of experimental manipulations, and sufficient behavioral complexity make zebrafish a valuable tool for high-throughput studies in biomedicine. To complement the available repositories for zebrafish genetic information, there is a growing need for the collection of zebrafish neurobehavioral and neurological phenotypes. For this, we are establishing the Zebrafish Neurophenome Database (ZND; www.tulane.edu/∼znpindex/search ) as a new dynamic online open-access data repository for behavioral and related physiological data. ZND, currently focusing on adult zebrafish, combines zebrafish neurophenotypic data with a simple, easily searchable user interface, which allow scientists to view and compare results obtained by other laboratories using various treatments in different testing paradigms.

25378312,T3DB: the toxic exposome database.,"The exposome is defined as the totality of all human environmental exposures from conception to death. It is often regarded as the complement to the genome, with the interaction between the exposome and the genome ultimately determining one's phenotype. The 'toxic exposome' is the complete collection of chronically or acutely toxic compounds to which humans can be exposed. Considerable interest in defining the toxic exposome has been spurred on by the realization that most human injuries, deaths and diseases are directly or indirectly caused by toxic substances found in the air, water, food, home or workplace. The Toxin-Toxin-Target Database (T3DB--www.t3db.ca) is a resource that was specifically designed to capture information about the toxic exposome. Originally released in 2010, the first version of T3DB contained data on nearly 2900 common toxic substances along with detailed information on their chemical properties, descriptions, targets, toxic effects, toxicity thresholds, sequences (for both targets and toxins), mechanisms and references. To more closely align itself with the needs of epidemiologists, toxicologists and exposome scientists, the latest release of T3DB has been substantially upgraded to include many more compounds (>3600), targets (>2000) and gene expression datasets (>15,000 genes). It now includes extensive data on 'normal' toxic compound concentrations in human biofluids as well as detailed chemical taxonomies, informative chemical ontologies and a large number of referential NMR, MS/MS and GC-MS spectra.

There are several useful online resources documenting hERG inhibition by known drugs and bioactives. However, their utilities remain somewhat limited because they are biased toward well-studied compounds and their number of data points tends to be much smaller than many commercial compound libraries.

These conditions can be life-threatening and are almost universally associated with long-term morbidity. Understanding the aetiology of these conditions requires multicentre collaboration and expertise, most often across national boundaries, with the capacity for long-term follow-up. The EuRRECa (European Registries for Rare Endocrine Conditions) project ( www.eurreca.net ), funded by the EU Health Programme, aims to support the needs of the wider endocrine community by maximising the opportunity for collaboration between patients, health care professionals and researchers across Europe and beyond. At the heart of the EuRRECa collaboration is a Core Endocrine Registry that collects a core dataset for all rare endocrine conditions that are covered within Endo-ERN. The registry incorporates patient reported markers of clinical outcome and will signpost participants to high-quality, disease-specific registries. Furthermore, an electronic surveillance programme (e-REC) captures clinical activity and epidemiology for these rare conditions. EuRRECa receives guidance compliant with the highest ethical standards from Expert Working Groups that align with the Main Thematic Groups of Endo-ERN. Security, data quality and data governance are cornerstones of this platform. Clear policies that are acceptable to patients, researchers and industry for data governance coupled with widespread dissemination and knowledge exchange through closely affiliated stakeholders will ensure sustainability beyond the current lifetime of the project.

The number of beta-lactamases and their variants is steadily increasing. The horizontal gene transfer likely plays a major role in dissemination of these markers to new environments and hosts. Moreover, information about the beta-lactamase classes and their variants was scattered. Categorizing all these classes and their associated variants along with their epidemiology and resistance pattern information on one platform could be helpful to the researcher working on multidrug-resistant bacteria. Thus, the beta-lactamase database (BLAD) has been developed to provide comprehensive information (epidemiology and resistance pattern) on beta-lactamases. Beta-lactamase gene sequences in BLAD are linked with structural data, phenotypic data (i.e. antibiotic resistance) and literature references to experimental studies. In summary, BLAD integrates information that may provide insight into the epidemiology of multidrug resistance and enable the designing of novel drug candidates.<h4>Availability</h4>The database can be accessed from the website www.blad.co.in.",False,True,,0.69423914,,blad,19.9972717,ok,,beta-lactamase database,,v2,0.9972717,BLAD,True,True,True,,http://www.blad.co.in,http://www.blad.co.in,True,,1,False,False,False

The semantic search paradigm of Go3R makes use of expert knowledge on 3Rs methods and regulatory toxicology, laid down in the ontology, a network of concepts, terms, and synonyms, to recognize the contents of documents. Search results are automatically sorted into a dynamic table of contents presented alongside the list of documents retrieved. This table of contents allows the user to quickly filter the set of documents by topics of interest. Documents containing hazard information are automatically assigned to a user interface following the endpoint-specific IUCLID5 categorization scheme required, e.g. for REACH registration dossiers. For this purpose, complex endpoint-specific search queries were compiled and integrated into the search engine (based upon a gold standard of 310 references that had been assigned manually to the different endpoint categories). Go3R sorts 87% of the references concordantly into the respective IUCLID5 categories. Currently, Go3R searches in the 22 million documents available in the PubMed and TOXNET databases.

Information for splicing is recognized by several factors that bind pre-mRNA sequence and, through coordinated interaction, yield mature transcripts. Some in silico methods have been developed to predict if a mutation leads to aberrant splicing patterns. We previously created SpliceAid tool that is able to minimize false positive predictions because it adopts strictly experimental RNA target motifs bound by splicing proteins in humans. In order to improve prediction accuracy and better understand the splicing outcome, the tissue specificity of each splicing regulatory factor has to be taken into account. Here, we have developed SpliceAid 2 by adding the expression data related to the splicing factors extracted from the main proteomic and transcriptomic databases, true 5' and 3' splice sites, polypyrimidine tracts, and branch point sequences. The new version collects 2,220 target sites of 62 human splicing proteins and their expression data in 320 tissues per cell.

29023571,PICKLE 2.0: A human protein-protein interaction meta-database employing data integration via genetic information ontology.,"It has been acknowledged that source databases recording experimentally supported human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) exhibit limited overlap. Thus, the reconstruction of a comprehensive PPI network requires appropriate integration of multiple heterogeneous primary datasets, presenting the PPIs at various genetic reference levels. Existing PPI meta-databases perform integration via normalization; namely, PPIs are merged after converted to a certain target level. Hence, the node set of the integrated network depends each time on the number and type of the combined datasets. Moreover, the irreversible a priori normalization process hinders the identification of normalization artifacts in the integrated network, which originate from the nonlinearity characterizing the genetic information flow. PICKLE (Protein InteraCtion KnowLedgebasE) 2.0 implements a new architecture for this recently introduced human PPI meta-database. Its main novel feature over the existing meta-databases is its approach to primary PPI dataset integration via genetic information ontology. Building upon the PICKLE principles of using the reviewed human complete proteome (RHCP) of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as the reference protein interactor set, and filtering out protein interactions with low probability of being direct based on the available evidence, PICKLE 2.0 first assembles the RHCP genetic information ontology network by connecting the corresponding genes, nucleotide sequences (mRNAs) and proteins (UniProt entries) and then integrates PPI datasets by superimposing them on the ontology network without any a priori transformations. Importantly, this process allows the resulting heterogeneous integrated network to be reversibly normalized to any level of genetic reference without loss of the original information, the latter being used for identification of normalization biases, and enables the appraisal of potential false positive interactions through PPI source database cross-checking. The PICKLE web-based interface (www.pickle.gr) allows for the simultaneous query of multiple entities and provides integrated human PPI networks at either the protein (UniProt) or the gene level, at three PPI filtering modes.",False,True,,0.7176881,,pickle,19.99655414,ok,,uniprotkb | uniprot | rotein interaction knowledgebase,,v2,0.99655414,PICKLE,True,True,True,,http://www.pickle.gr,http://www.pickle.gr,True,,1,False,False,False

34715518,GeneCoNet: A web application server for constructing cancer patient-specific gene correlation networks with prognostic gene pairs.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>Most prognostic gene signatures that have been known for cancer are either individual genes or combination of genes. Both individual genes and combination of genes do not provide information on gene-gene relations, and often have less prognostic significance than random genes associated with cell proliferation. Several methods for generating sample-specific gene networks have been proposed, but programs implementing the methods are not publicly available.<h4>Methods</h4>We have developed a method that builds gene correlation networks specific to individual cancer patients and derives prognostic gene correlations from the networks. A gene correlation network specific to a patient is constructed by identifying gene-gene relations that are significantly different from normal samples. Prognostic gene pairs are obtained by carrying out the Cox proportional hazards regression and the log-rank test for every gene pair.<h4>Results</h4>We built a web application server called GeneCoNet with thousands of tumor samples in TCGA. Given a tumor sample ID of TCGA, GeneCoNet dynamically constructs a gene correlation network specific to the sample as output. As an additional output, it provides information on prognostic gene correlations in the network. GeneCoNet found several prognostic gene correlations for six types of cancer, but there were no prognostic gene pairs common to multiple cancer types.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Extensive analysis of patient-specific gene correlation networks suggests that patients with a larger subnetwork of prognostic gene pairs have shorter survival time than the others and that patients with a subnetwork that contains more genes participating in prognostic gene pairs have shorter survival time than the others. GeneCoNet can be used as a valuable resource for generating gene correlation networks specific to individual patients and for identifying prognostic gene correlations.

23735058,AllerTOP--a server for in silico prediction of allergens.,"<h4>Background</h4>Allergy is a form of hypersensitivity to normally innocuous substances, such as dust, pollen, foods or drugs. Allergens are small antigens that commonly provoke an IgE antibody response. There are two types of bioinformatics-based allergen prediction. The first approach follows FAO/WHO Codex alimentarius guidelines and searches for sequence similarity. The second approach is based on identifying conserved allergenicity-related linear motifs. Both approaches assume that allergenicity is a linearly coded property. In the present study, we applied ACC pre-processing to sets of known allergens, developing alignment-independent models for allergen recognition based on the main chemical properties of amino acid sequences.<h4>Results</h4>A set of 684 food, 1,156 inhalant and 555 toxin allergens was collected from several databases. A set of non-allergens from the same species were selected to mirror the allergen set. The amino acids in the protein sequences were described by three z-descriptors (z1, z2 and z3) and by auto- and cross-covariance (ACC) transformation were converted into uniform vectors. Each protein was presented as a vector of 45 variables. Five machine learning methods for classification were applied in the study to derive models for allergen prediction. The methods were: discriminant analysis by partial least squares (DA-PLS), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), naïve Bayes (NB) and k nearest neighbours (kNN). The best performing model was derived by kNN at k = 3. It was optimized, cross-validated and implemented in a server named AllerTOP, freely accessible at http://www.pharmfac.net/allertop. AllerTOP also predicts the most probable route of exposure. In comparison to other servers for allergen prediction, AllerTOP outperforms them with 94% sensitivity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AllerTOP is the first alignment-free server for in silico prediction of allergens based on the main physicochemical properties of proteins.

With the advance of next-generation sequencing technology, the number of completely sequenced chloroplast genomes is expected to increase exponentially, powerful computational tools annotating the genome sequences are in urgent need.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a web server CPGAVAS. The server accepts a complete chloroplast genome sequence as input. First, it predicts protein-coding and rRNA genes based on the identification and mapping of the most similar, full-length protein, cDNA and rRNA sequences by integrating results from Blastx, Blastn, protein2genome and est2genome programs. Second, tRNA genes and inverted repeats (IR) are identified using tRNAscan, ARAGORN and vmatch respectively. Third, it calculates the summary statistics for the annotated genome. Fourth, it generates a circular map ready for publication. Fifth, it can create a Sequin file for GenBank submission. Last, it allows the extractions of protein and mRNA sequences for given list of genes and species. The annotation results in GFF3 format can be edited using any compatible annotation editing tools. The edited annotations can then be uploaded to CPGAVAS for update and re-analyses repeatedly. Using known chloroplast genome sequences as test set, we show that CPGAVAS performs comparably to another application DOGMA, while having several superior functionalities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CPGAVAS allows the semi-automatic and complete annotation of a chloroplast genome sequence, and the visualization, editing and analysis of the annotation results.

Today, there is more biological information than ever but, unfortunately, the current status of many of these repositories is far from being optimal. Some of the most common problems are that the information is spread out in many small databases; frequently there are different standards among repositories and some databases are no longer supported or they contain too specific and unconnected information. In addition, data size is increasingly becoming an obstacle when accessing or storing biological data. All these issues make very difficult to extract and integrate information from different sources, to analyze experiments or to access and query this information in a programmatic way.

It can be achieved most accurately by explicit phylogenetic inference. More and more species are subjected to large-scale sequencing, but the resultant resources are scattered in independent project-based, and multi-species, but separate, web sites. This complicates data access and is becoming a serious barrier to the comprehensiveness of molecular phylogenetic analysis. aLeaves, launched to overcome this difficulty, collects sequences similar to an input query sequence from various data sources. The collected sequences can be passed on to the MAFFT sequence alignment server (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), which has been significantly improved in interactivity. This update enables to switch between (i) sequence selection using the Archaeopteryx tree viewer, (ii) multiple sequence alignment and (iii) tree inference.

Their primary function is to allow the host immune system to be able to distinguish between self and non-self peptides-e.g. derived from invading pathogens. However, these genes have also been implicated in immune-mediated adverse drug reactions (ADRs), presenting a problem to patients, clinicians and pharmaceutical companies. We have previously developed the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) that captures the allelic and haplotype frequencies for these HLA genes across many healthy populations from around the world. Here, we report the development and release of the HLA-ADR database that captures data from publications where HLA alleles and haplotypes have been associated with ADRs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis and drug-induced liver injury). HLA-ADR was created by using data obtained through systematic review of the literature and semi-automated literature mining. The database also draws on data already present in AFND allowing users to compare and analyze allele frequencies in both ADR patients and healthy populations.

However, accessing this wealth of plant diversity requires the characterization of this material using state-of-the-art genomic, phenomic and molecular technologies and the release of subsequent research data via a long-term stable, open-access portal. Although several international consortia and public resource centres offer services for plant research data management, valuable digital assets remains unpublished and thus inaccessible to the scientific community. Recently, the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research and the German Plant Phenotyping Network have jointly initiated the Plant Genomics and Phenomics Research Data Repository (PGP) as infrastructure to comprehensively publish plant research data. This covers in particular cross-domain datasets that are not being published in central repositories because of its volume or unsupported data scope, like image collections from plant phenotyping and microscopy, unfinished genomes, genotyping data, visualizations of morphological plant models, data from mass spectrometry as well as software and documents.The repository is hosted at Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research using e!DAL as software infrastructure and a Hierarchical Storage Management System as data archival backend. A novel developed data submission tool was made available for the consortium that features a high level of automation to lower the barriers of data publication. After an internal review process, data are published as citable digital object identifiers and a core set of technical metadata is registered at DataCite.

34710512,Development of a database and standardized approach for rpoB sequence-based subtyping and identification of aerobic spore-forming Bacillales.,"Aerobic spore-forming Bacillales are a highly diverse and ubiquitous group that includes organisms that cause foodborne illnesses and food spoilage. Classical microbiological and biochemical identification of members of the order Bacillales represents a challenge due to the diversity of organisms in this group as well as the fact that the phenotypic-based taxonomic assignment of some named species in this group is not consistent with their phylogenomic characteristics. DNA-sequencing-based tools, on the other hand, can be fast and cost-effective, and can provide for a more reliable identification and characterization of Bacillales isolates. In comparison to 16S rDNA, rpoB was shown to better discriminate between Bacillales isolates and to allow for improved taxonomic assignment to the species level. However, the lack of a publicly accessible rpoB database, as well as the lack of standardized protocols for rpoB-based typing and strain identification, is a major challenge. Here, we report (i) the curation of a DNA sequence database for rpoB-based subtype classification of Bacillales isolates; (ii) the development of standardized protocols for generating rpoB sequence data, and a scheme for rpoB-based initial taxonomic identification of Bacillales isolates at the species level; and (iii) the integration of the database in a publicly accessible online platform that allows for the analysis of rpoB sequence data from uncharacterized Bacillales isolates. Specifically, we curated a database of DNA sequences for a 632-nt internal variable region within the rpoB gene from representative Bacillales reference type strains and a large number of isolates that we have previously isolated and characterized through multiple projects. As of May 21, 2021, the rpoB database contained more than 8350 rpoB sequences representing 1902 distinct rpoB allelic types that can be classified into 160 different genera. The database also includes 1129 rpoB sequences for representative Bacillales reference type strains as available on May 21, 2021 in the NCBI database. The rpoB database is integrated into the online Food Microbe Tracker platform (www.foodmicrobetracker.com) and can be queried using the integrated BLAST tool to initially subtype and taxonomically identify aerobic and facultative anaerobic spore-formers. While whole-genome sequencing is increasingly used in bacterial taxonomy, the rpoB sequence-based identification scheme described here provides a valuable tool as it allows for rapid and cost-effective initial isolate characterization, which can help to identify and characterize foodborne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria. In addition, the database and primers described here can also be adopted for metagenomics approaches that include rpoB as a target, improving discriminatory power and identification over what can be achieved using 16S rDNA as a target.",False,True,,0.70269376,,rpob,19.98868513,ok,,,,v2,0.98868513,,True,False,False,,http://www.foodmicrobetracker.com,http://www.foodmicrobetracker.com,True,,1,False,False,False

The DDBJ Fast Annotation and Submission Tool (DFAST) is a newly developed genome annotation pipeline with quality and taxonomy assessment tools. To enable annotation of ready-to-submit quality, we also constructed curated reference protein databases tailored for lactic acid bacteria. DFAST was developed so that all the procedures required for DDBJ submission could be done seamlessly online. The online workspace would be especially useful for users not familiar with bioinformatics skills. In addition, we have developed a genome repository, DFAST Archive of Genome Annotation (DAGA), which currently includes 1,421 genomes covering 179 species and 18 subspecies of two genera, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Pediococcus</i>, obtained from both DDBJ/ENA/GenBank and Sequence Read Archive (SRA). All the genomes deposited in DAGA were annotated consistently and assessed using DFAST. To assess the taxonomic position based on genomic sequence information, we used the average nucleotide identity (ANI), which showed high discriminative power to determine whether two given genomes belong to the same species. We corrected mislabeled or misidentified genomes in the public database and deposited the curated information in DAGA. The repository will improve the accessibility and reusability of genome resources for lactic acid bacteria.

STRinNGS identifies sequence reads with STR loci by their flanking sequences, it analyses the STR sequence and the flanking regions, and generates a report with the assigned SNP-STR alleles. The main output file from STRinNGS contains all sequences with read counts above 1% of the total number of reads per locus. STR sequences are automatically named according to the nomenclature used previously and according to the repeat unit definitions in STRBase (http://www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/). The sequences are named with (1) the locus name, (2) the length of the repeat region divided by the length of the repeat unit, (3) the sequence(s) of the repeat unit(s) followed by the number of repeats and (4) variations in the flanking regions. Lower case letters in the main output file are used to flag sequences with previously unknown variations in the STRs. SNPs in the flanking regions are named by their ""rs"" numbers and the nucleotides in the SNP position. Data from 207 Danes sequenced with the Ion Torrent™ HID STR 10-plex that amplified nine STRs (CSF1PO, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D16S539, TH01, TPOX, vWA), and Amelogenin was analysed with STRinNGS. Sequencing uncovered five common SNPs near four STRs and revealed 20 new alleles in the 207 Danes. Three short homopolymers in the D8S1179 flanking regions caused frequent sequencing errors. In 29 of 3726 allele calls (0.8%), sequences with homopolymer errors were falsely assigned as true alleles. An in-house developed script in R compensated for these errors by compiling sequence reads that had identical STR sequences and identical nucleotides in the five common SNPs. In the output file from the R script, all SNP-STR haplotype calls were correct. The 207 samples and six additional samples were sequenced for D3S1358, D12S391, and D21S11 using the 454 GS Junior platform in this and a previous work. Overall, next generation sequencing (NGS) of the 11 STRs lowered the mean match probability 386 times and increased the typical paternity indexes (i.e. the geometric mean) for trios and duos 47 and 23 times, respectively, compared to the traditional PCR-CE typing of the same population.",False,True,,0.6070359,strinngs,,19.97382367,ok,,strbase,,v2,0.97382367,,True,False,False,,http://www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/,http://www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/,True,...ording to the repeat unit definitions in STRBase (http://www.cstl.nist.gov/strbase/).

34393586,"Kakila database: Towards a FAIR community approved database of cetacean presence in the waters of the Guadeloupe Archipelago, based on citizen science.","<h4>Background</h4>In the French West Indies, more than 20 species of cetaceans have been observed over the last decades. The recognition of this hotspot of biodiversity of marine mammals, observed in the French Exclusive Economic Zone of the West Indies, motivated the French government to create in 2010 a marine protected area (MPA) dedicated to the conservation of marine mammals: the Agoa Sanctuary. Threats that cetacean populations face are multiple, but well-documented. Cetacean conservation can only be achieved if relevant and reliable data are available, starting by occurrence data. In the Guadeloupe Archipelago and in addition to some data collected by the Agoa Sanctuary, occurrence data are mainly available through the contribution of citizen science and of local stakeholders (i.e. non-profit organisations (NPO) and whale-watchers). However, no observation network has been coordinated and no standards exist for cetacean presence data collection and management.<h4>New information</h4>In recent years, several whale watchers and NPOs regularly collected cetacean observation data around the Guadeloupe Archipelago. Our objective was to gather datasets from three Guadeloupean whale watchers, two NPOs and the Agoa Sanctuary, that agreed to share their data. These heterogeneous data went through a careful process of curation and standardisation in order to create a new extended database, using a newly-designed metadata set. This aggregated dataset contains a total of 4,704 records of 21 species collected in the Guadeloupe Archipelago from 2000 to 2019. The database was called Kakila (""who is there?"" in Guadeloupean Creole). The Kakila database was developed following the FAIR principles with the ultimate objective of ensuring sustainability. All these data were transferred into the PNDB repository (Pöle National de Données de Biodiversité, Biodiversity French Data Hub, https://www.pndb.fr).In the Agoa Sanctuary and surrounding waters, marine mammals have to interact with increasing anthropogenic pressure from growing human activities. In this context, the Kakila database fulfils the need for an organised system to structure marine mammal occurrences collected by multiple local stakeholders with a common objective: contribute to the knowledge and conservation of cetaceans living in the French Antilles waters. Much needed data analysis will enable us to identify high cetacean presence areas, to document the presence of rarer species and to determine areas of possible negative interactions with anthropogenic activities.",False,True,,0.658971,,kakila,19.91363263,ok,,,pndb,v2,0.91363263,Kakila database,True,False,False,,https://www.pndb.fr | http://www.pndb.fr,https://www.pndb.fr,True,"...es de Biodiversité, Biodiversity French Data Hub, https://www.pndb.fr).In the Agoa Sanctuary and surrounding waters, ma...",1,False,False,False

Much of the available data are being deposited in specialized databases, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for microarrays or the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for protein structures and coordinates. Data sets are also being described by their authors in publications archived in literature databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed Central. Currently, the curation of links between biological databases and the literature mainly relies on manual labour, which makes it a time-consuming and daunting task. Herein, we analysed the current state of link curation between GEO, PDB and MEDLINE. We found that the link curation is heterogeneous depending on the sources and databases involved, and that overlap between sources is low, <50% for PDB and GEO. Furthermore, we showed that text-mining tools can automatically provide valuable evidence to help curators broaden the scope of articles and database entries that they review. As a result, we made recommendations to improve the coverage of curated links, as well as the consistency of information available from different databases while maintaining high-quality curation.

However, sequence data alone is not sufficient to explain the biological behaviour of organisms, which arises largely from complex molecular interactions. There is a need to develop new platform technologies that can be applied to the investigation of whole-genome datasets in an efficient and cost-effective manner. One such approach is the transfer of existing knowledge from well-studied organisms to closely-related organisms.

33245626,"EffectorK, a comprehensive resource to mine for Ralstonia, Xanthomonas, and other published effector interactors in the Arabidopsis proteome.","Pathogens deploy effector proteins that interact with host proteins to manipulate the host physiology to the pathogen's own benefit. However, effectors can also be recognized by host immune proteins, leading to the activation of defence responses. Effectors are thus essential components in determining the outcome of plant-pathogen interactions. Despite major efforts to decipher effector functions, our current knowledge on effector biology is scattered and often limited. In this study, we conducted two systematic large-scale yeast two-hybrid screenings to detect interactions between Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and effectors from two vascular bacterial pathogens: Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum and Xanthomonas campestris. We then constructed an interactomic network focused on Arabidopsis and effector proteins from a wide variety of bacterial, oomycete, fungal, and invertebrate pathogens. This network contains our experimental data and protein-protein interactions from 2,035 peer-reviewed publications (48,200 Arabidopsis-Arabidopsis and 1,300 Arabidopsis-effector protein interactions). Our results show that effectors from different species interact with both common and specific Arabidopsis interactors, suggesting dual roles as modulators of generic and adaptive host processes. Network analyses revealed that effector interactors, particularly ""effector hubs"" and bacterial core effector interactors, occupy important positions for network organization, as shown by their larger number of protein interactions and centrality. These interactomic data were incorporated in EffectorK, a new graph-oriented knowledge database that allows users to navigate the network, search for homology, or find possible paths between host and/or effector proteins.

The yields and subspecies of sperm-borne RNAs isolated from sperm can vary drastically depending on the methods used, and no cross-species analyses of sperm RNA contents have ever been conducted using a standardized sperm RNA isolation protocol. To address these issues, we developed a simple RNA isolation method that is applicable to sperm of various species, thus allowing for reliable interspecies comparisons. Based on RNA-Seq analyses, we established SpermBase (www.spermbase.org), a database dedicated to sperm-borne RNA profiling of multiple species. Currently, SpermBase contains large and small RNA expression data for mouse, rat, rabbit and human total sperm and sperm heads.

24647222,openSNP--a crowdsourced web resource for personal genomics.,"Genome-Wide Association Studies are widely used to correlate phenotypic traits with genetic variants. These studies usually compare the genetic variation between two groups to single out certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked to a phenotypic variation in one of the groups. However, it is necessary to have a large enough sample size to find statistically significant correlations. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companies offer the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low cost without the need to consult a physician or geneticist. Over 100,000 people have already been genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies. However, this data is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in research. It seems reasonable to create a central open data repository for such data. Here we present the web platform openSNP, an open database which allows participants of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data at no cost along with phenotypic information.

25228549,LmTDRM database: a comprehensive database on thiol metabolic gene/gene products in Listeria monocytogenes EGDe.,"There are a number of databases on the Listeria species and about their genome. However, these databases do not specifically address a set of network that is important in defence mechanism of the bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes EGDe is a well-established intracellular model organism to study host pathogenicity because of its versatility in the host environment. Here, we have focused on thiol disulphide redox metabolic network proteins, specifically in L. monocytogenes EGDe. The thiol redox metabolism is involved in oxidative stress mechanism and is found in all living cells. It functions to maintain the thiol disulphide balance required for protein folding by providing reducing power. Nevertheless, they are involved in the reversible oxidation of thiol groups in biomolecules by creating disulphide bonds; therefore, the term thiol disulphide redox metabolism (TDRM). TDRM network genes play an important role in oxidative stress mechanism and during host&ndash;pathogen interaction. Therefore, it is essential to have detailed information on these proteins with regard to other bacteria and its genome analysis to understand the presence of tRNA, transposons, and insertion elements for horizontal gene transfer. LmTDRM database is a new comprehensive web-based database on thiol proteins and their functions. It includes: Description, Search, TDRM analysis, and genome viewer. The quality of these data has been evaluated before they were aggregated to produce a final representation.

24810851,e-RNA: a collection of web servers for comparative RNA structure prediction and visualisation.,"e-RNA offers a free and open-access collection of five published RNA sequence analysis tools, each solving specific problems not readily addressed by other available tools. Given multiple sequence alignments, Transat detects all conserved helices, including those expected in a final structure, but also transient, alternative and pseudo-knotted helices. RNA-Decoder uses unique evolutionary models to detect conserved RNA secondary structure in alignments which may be partly protein-coding. SimulFold simultaneously co-estimates the potentially pseudo-knotted conserved structure, alignment and phylogenetic tree for a set of homologous input sequences. CoFold predicts the minimum-free energy structure for an input sequence while taking the effects of co-transcriptional folding into account, thereby greatly improving the prediction accuracy for long sequences. R-chie is a program to visualise RNA secondary structures as arc diagrams, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of conserved base-pairs and quantitative features.

Dose-response and gene mutation data are frequently analysed by industry, academia and governmental agencies for regulatory evaluations and decision making. Over the years, a number of efforts at different institutions have led to the creation and curation of databases to house genetic toxicology data, largely, with the aim of providing public access to facilitate research and regulatory assessments. This article provides a brief introduction to a new genetic toxicology portal called Mutation Analysis Informatics Tools (MutAIT) (www.mutait.org) that provides easy access to two of the largest genetic toxicology databases, the Mammalian Gene Mutation Database (MGMD) and TransgenicDB. TransgenicDB is a comprehensive collection of transgenic rodent mutation data initially compiled and collated by Health Canada. The updated MGMD contains approximately 50 000 individual mutation spectral records from the published literature. The portal not only gives access to an enormous quantity of genetic toxicology data, but also provides statistical tools for dose-response analysis and calculation of benchmark dose. Two important R packages for dose-response analysis are provided as web-distributed applications with user-friendly graphical interfaces. The 'drsmooth' package performs dose-response shape analysis and determines various points of departure (PoD) metrics and the 'PROAST' package provides algorithms for dose-response modelling. The MutAIT statistical tools, which are currently being enhanced, provide users with an efficient and comprehensive platform to conduct quantitative dose-response analyses and determine PoD values that can then be used to calculate human exposure limits or margins of exposure.",False,True,,0.7159683,,mutait,18.99840266,ok,mgmd | mammalian gene mutation database,mutation analysis informatics tools | mammalian gene mutation database | transgenicdb,mgmd,v2,0.99840266,MutAIT,True,True,True,,http://www.mutait.org,http://www.mutait.org,True,,1,False,False,False

To provide collective knowledge with help from experts in tRNA researches, we added a column for enregistering comments to each tRNA. By grouping bacterial tRNAs with an identical sequence, we have found high phylogenetic preservation of tRNA sequences, especially at the phylum level. Since many species-unknown tRNAs from metagenomic sequences have sequences identical to those found in species-known prokaryotes, the identical sequence group (ISG) can provide phylogenetic markers to investigate the microbial community in an environmental ecosystem. This strategy can be applied to a huge amount of short sequences obtained from next-generation sequencers, as showing that tRNADB-CE is a well-timed database in the era of big sequence data.

23550212,The switches.ELM resource: a compendium of conditional regulatory interaction interfaces.,"Short linear motifs (SLiMs) are protein interaction sites that play an important role in cell regulation by controlling protein activity, localization, and local abundance. The functionality of a SLiM can be modulated in a context-dependent manner to induce a gain, loss, or exchange of binding partners, which will affect the function of the SLiM-containing protein. As such, these conditional interactions underlie molecular decision-making in cell signaling. We identified multiple types of pre- and posttranslational switch mechanisms that can regulate the function of a SLiM and thereby control its interactions. The collected examples of experimentally characterized SLiM-based switch mechanisms were curated in the freely accessible switches.ELM resource (http://switches.elm.eu.org). On the basis of these examples, we defined and integrated rules to analyze SLiMs for putative regulatory switch mechanisms. We applied these rules to known validated SLiMs, providing evidence that more than half of these are likely to be pre- or posttranslationally regulated. In addition, we showed that posttranslationally modified sites are enriched around SLiMs, which enables cooperative and integrative regulation of protein interaction interfaces.

Many RBPs have been found to be dysregulated in cancers; however, there was no tool to incorporate high-throughput data from different dimensions to systematically identify cancer-related RBPs and to explore their causes of abnormality and their potential functions. Therefore, we developed a database named RBPTD to identify cancer-related RBPs in humans and systematically explore their functions and abnormalities by integrating different types of data, including gene expression profiles, prognosis data and DNA copy number variation (CNV), among 28 cancers. We found a total of 454 significantly differentially expressed RBPs, 1970 RBPs with significant prognostic value, and 53 dysregulated RBPs correlated with CNV abnormality. Functions of 26 cancer-related RBPs were explored by analysing high-throughput RNA sequencing data obtained by crosslinking immunoprecipitation, and the remaining RBP functions were predicted by calculating their correlation coefficient with other genes. Finally, we developed the RBPTD for users to explore functions and abnormalities of cancer-related RBPs to improve our understanding of their roles in tumorigenesis.

24700812,3PFDB+: improved search protocol and update for the identification of representatives of protein sequence domain families.,"Protein domain families are usually classified on the basis of similarity of amino acid sequences. Selection of a single representative sequence for each family provides targets for structure determination or modeling and also enables fast sequence searches to associate new members to a family. Such a selection could be challenging since some of these domain families exhibit huge variation depending on the number of members in the family, the average family sequence length or the extent of sequence divergence within a family. We had earlier created 3PFDB database as a repository of best representative sequences, selected from each PFAM domain family on the basis of high coverage. In this study, we have improved the database using more efficient strategies for the initial generation of sequence profiles and implement two independent methods, FASSM and HMMER, for identifying family members. HMMER employs a global sequence similarity search, while FASSM relies on motif identification and matching. This improved and updated database, 3PFDB+ generated in this study, provides representative sequences and profiles for PFAM families, with 13 519 family representatives having more than 90% family coverage. The representative sequence is also highlighted in a two-dimensional plot, which reflects the relative divergence between family members. Representatives belonging to small families with short sequences are mainly associated with low coverage. The set of sequences not recognized by the family representative profiles, highlight several potential false or weak family associations in PFAM. Partial domains and fragments dominate such cases, along with sequences that are highly diverged or different from other family members. Some of these outliers were also predicted to have different secondary structure contents, which reflect different putative structure or functional roles for these domain sequences.

Therefore, this irregularity is a major safety concern in the case of drugs submitted for regulatory approval. The most common mechanism of drug-induced QT interval prolongation may be drug-related inhibition of the human ether-á-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel, which subsequently results in prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD). hERGAPDbase is a database of electrophysiological experimental data documenting potential hERG channel inhibitory actions and the APD-prolongation activities of chemical compounds.

22238258,IMID: integrated molecular interaction database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Molecular interaction information, such as protein-protein interactions and protein-small molecule interactions, is indispensable for understanding the mechanism of biological processes and discovering treatments for diseases. Many databases have been built by manual annotation of literature to organize such information into structured form. However, most databases focus on only one type of interactions, which are often not well annotated and integrated with related functional information.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we integrate molecular interaction information from literature by automatic information extraction and from manually annotated databases. We further integrate the relationships between protein/gene and other bio-entity terms including gene ontology terms, pathways, species and diseases to build an integrated molecular interaction database (IMID). Interactions can be selected by their associated probabilities. IMID allows complex and versatile queries for context-specific molecular interactions, which are not available currently in other molecular interaction databases.<h4>Availability</h4>The database is located at www.integrativebiology.org.",False,True,,0.7224353,,imid,18.9972841,ok,imid | integrated molecular interaction database,interaction database | integrated molecular interaction database | molecular interaction database,,v2,0.9972841,IMID,True,True,True,,http://www.integrativebiology.org,http://www.integrativebiology.org,True,,1,False,False,False

28007960,"PrenDB, a Substrate Prediction Database to Enable Biocatalytic Use of Prenyltransferases.","Prenyltransferases of the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS) superfamily catalyze the attachment of prenyl or prenyl-like moieties to diverse acceptor compounds. These acceptor molecules are generally aromatic in nature and mostly indole or indole-like. Their catalytic transformation represents a major skeletal diversification step in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including the indole alkaloids. DMATS enzymes thus contribute significantly to the biological and pharmacological diversity of small molecule metabolites. Understanding the substrate specificity of these enzymes could create opportunities for their biocatalytic use in preparing complex synthetic scaffolds. However, there has been no framework to achieve this in a rational way. Here, we report a chemoinformatic pipeline to enable prenyltransferase substrate prediction. We systematically catalogued 32 unique prenyltransferases and 167 unique substrates to create possible reaction matrices and compiled these data into a browsable database named PrenDB. We then used a newly developed algorithm based on molecular fragmentation to automatically extract reactive chemical epitopes. The analysis of the collected data sheds light on the thus far explored substrate space of DMATS enzymes. To assess the predictive performance of our virtual reaction extraction tool, 38 potential substrates were tested as prenyl acceptors in assays with three prenyltransferases, and we were able to detect turnover in >55% of the cases. The database, PrenDB (www.kolblab.org/prendb.php), enables the prediction of potential substrates for chemoenzymatic synthesis through substructure similarity and virtual chemical transformation techniques.

Multivalency can enhance binding affinity dramatically. To understand the mechanism of multivalent binding in more detail model systems of bi- and multivalent receptors are needed, but are difficult to find. Furthermore it is useful to know about multivalent receptors, which can serve as targets to design multivalent drugs. The present contribution tries to close this gap. The Bival-Bind database (http://agknapp.chemie.fu-berlin.de/bivalbind) provides a relatively complete list - 2073 protein complexes with less than 90% sequence identity - out of the protein database, which can serve as bi- or multivalent receptors. Steric clashes of molecular spacers - necessary to connect the monomeric ligand units - with the receptor surface can diminish binding affinity dramatically and, thus, abolish the expected enhancement of binding affinity due to the multivalency. The potential multivalent receptors in the Bival-Bind database are characterized with respect to the receptor surface topography.

To most effectively identify and quantify proteoforms in genetically diverse samples by mass spectrometry (MS), it is advantageous to search the MS data against a sample-specific protein database that is tailored to the sample being analyzed, in that it contains the correct amino acid sequences and relevant PTMs for that sample. To this end, we have developed Spritz (https://smith-chem-wisc.github.io/Spritz/), an open-source software tool for generating protein databases annotated with sequence variations and PTMs. We provide a simple graphical user interface for Windows and scripts that can be run on any operating system. Spritz automatically sets up and executes approximately 20 tools, which enable the construction of a proteogenomic database from only raw RNA sequencing data. Sequence variations that are discovered in RNA sequencing data upon comparison to the Ensembl reference genome are annotated on proteins in these databases, and PTM annotations are transferred from UniProt. Modifications can also be discovered and added to the database using bottom-up mass spectrometry data and global PTM discovery in MetaMorpheus. We demonstrate that such sample-specific databases allow the identification of variant peptides, modified variant peptides, and variant proteoforms by searching bottom-up and top-down proteomic data from the Jurkat human T lymphocyte cell line and demonstrate the identification of phosphorylated variant sites with phosphoproteomic data from the U2OS human osteosarcoma cell line.",False,True,,0.7172655,,spritz,18.99641526,ok,,ensembl | uniprot,,v2,0.99641526,Spritz,True,True,True,,https://smith-chem-wisc.github.io/Spritz/,https://smith-chem-wisc.github.io/Spritz/,True,"...at sample.

28969593,BioCarian: search engine for exploratory searches in heterogeneous biological databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>There are a large number of biological databases publicly available for scientists in the web. Also, there are many private databases generated in the course of research projects. These databases are in a wide variety of formats. Web standards have evolved in the recent times and semantic web technologies are now available to interconnect diverse and heterogeneous sources of data. Therefore, integration and querying of biological databases can be facilitated by techniques used in semantic web. Heterogeneous databases can be converted into Resource Description Format (RDF) and queried using SPARQL language. Searching for exact queries in these databases is trivial. However, exploratory searches need customized solutions, especially when multiple databases are involved. This process is cumbersome and time consuming for those without a sufficient background in computer science. In this context, a search engine facilitating exploratory searches of databases would be of great help to the scientific community.<h4>Results</h4>We present BioCarian, an efficient and user-friendly search engine for performing exploratory searches on biological databases. The search engine is an interface for SPARQL queries over RDF databases. We note that many of the databases can be converted to tabular form. We first convert the tabular databases to RDF. The search engine provides a graphical interface based on facets to explore the converted databases. The facet interface is more advanced than conventional facets. It allows complex queries to be constructed, and have additional features like ranking of facet values based on several criteria, visually indicating the relevance of a facet value and presenting the most important facet values when a large number of choices are available. For the advanced users, SPARQL queries can be run directly on the databases. Using this feature, users will be able to incorporate federated searches of SPARQL endpoints. We used the search engine to do an exploratory search on previously published viral integration data and were able to deduce the main conclusions of the original publication.

31603259,The AQUA-MER databases and aqueous speciation server: A web resource for multiscale modeling of mercury speciation.,"To assess the chemical reactivity, toxicity, and mobility of pollutants in the environment, knowledge of their species distributions is critical. Because their direct measurement is often infeasible, speciation modeling is widely adopted. Mercury (Hg) is a representative pollutant for which study of its speciation benefits from modeling. However, Hg speciation modeling is often hindered by a lack of reliable thermodynamic constants. Although computational chemistry (e.g., density functional theory [DFT]) can generate these constants, methods for directly coupling DFT and speciation modeling are not available. Here, we combine computational chemistry and continuum-scale modeling with curated online databases to ameliorate the problem of unreliable inputs to Hg speciation modeling. Our AQUA-MER databases and web server (https://aquamer.ornl.gov) provides direct speciation results by combining web-based interfaces to a speciation calculator, databases of thermodynamic constants, and a computational chemistry toolkit to estimate missing constants.

However, because protein-coding regions are under high selective constraints, these variants occur at low frequencies, such that there is often insufficient statistics for downstream calculations. To address this problem, we develop the Intensification approach, which uses the modular structure of repeat protein domains to amplify signals of selection from population genetics and traditional interspecies conservation. In particular, we are able to aggregate variants at the codon level to identify important positions in repeat domains that show strong conservation signals. This allows us to compare conservation over different evolutionary timescales. It also enables us to visualize population-genetic measures on protein structures.

30519990,MER: a shell script and annotation server for minimal named entity recognition and linking.,"Named-entity recognition aims at identifying the fragments of text that mention entities of interest, that afterwards could be linked to a knowledge base where those entities are described. This manuscript presents our minimal named-entity recognition and linking tool (MER), designed with flexibility, autonomy and efficiency in mind. To annotate a given text, MER only requires: (1) a lexicon (text file) with the list of terms representing the entities of interest; (2) optionally a tab-separated values file with a link for each term; (3) and a Unix shell. Alternatively, the user can provide an ontology from where MER will automatically generate the lexicon and links files. The efficiency of MER derives from exploring the high performance and reliability of the text processing command-line tools grep and awk, and a novel inverted recognition technique. MER was deployed in a cloud infrastructure using multiple Virtual Machines to work as an annotation server and participate in the Technical Interoperability and Performance of annotation Servers task of BioCreative V.5. The results show that our solution processed each document (text retrieval and annotation) in less than 3 s on average without using any type of cache. MER was also compared to a state-of-the-art dictionary lookup solution obtaining competitive results not only in computational performance but also in precision and recall.

The purpose of this paper is to present a web-based tool, REGSTATTOOLShttp://regstattools.net intended to provide analysis for the burden of cancer, or other group of disease registry data. Three software applications are included in REGSTATTOOLS: SART (analysis of disease's rates and its time trends), RiskDiff (analysis of percent changes in the rates due to demographic factors and risk of developing or dying from a disease) and WAERS (relative survival analysis).<h4>Results</h4>We show a real-data application through the assessment of the burden of tobacco-related cancer incidence in two Spanish regions in the period 1995-2004. Making use of SART we show that lung cancer is the most common cancer among those cancers, with rising trends in incidence among women. We compared 2000-2004 data with that of 1995-1999 to assess percent changes in the number of cases as well as relative survival using RiskDiff and WAERS, respectively. We show that the net change increase in lung cancer cases among women was mainly attributable to an increased risk of developing lung cancer, whereas in men it is attributable to the increase in population size. Among men, lung cancer relative survival was higher in 2000-2004 than in 1995-1999, whereas it was similar among women when these time periods were compared.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Unlike other similar applications, REGSTATTOOLS does not require local software installation and it is simple to use, fast and easy to interpret.

In particular, glia-secreted proteins form a basis of a complex network of glia-neuron or glia-glia interactions in health and diseases. In recent years, the analysis and profiling of glial secretomes have raised new expectations for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders due to the vital role of glia in numerous physiological or pathological processes of the nervous system. However, there is no online database of glia-secreted proteins available to facilitate glial research.

Among them, in-depth exploration of ligand-driven protein dynamics contributes to an optimal understanding of protein function, which is particularly relevant to drug discovery. Hence, a wide range of computational tools have been designed to investigate the important dynamic information in proteins. However, performing and analyzing protein dynamics is still challenging due to the complicated operation steps, giving rise to great difficulty, especially for nonexperts. Moreover, there is a lack of web protocol to provide online facility to investigate and visualize ligand-driven protein dynamics.

BioMuta, an integrated sequence feature database, provides a framework for automated and manual curation and integration of cancer-related sequence features so that they can be used in NGS analysis pipelines. Sequence feature information in BioMuta is collected from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), ClinVar, UniProtKB and through biocuration of information available from publications. Additionally, nsSNVs identified through automated analysis of NGS data from TCGA are also included in the database. Because of the petabytes of data and information present in NGS primary repositories, a platform HIVE (High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment) for storing, analyzing, computing and curating NGS data and associated metadata has been developed. Using HIVE, 31 979 nsSNVs were identified in TCGA-derived NGS data from breast cancer patients. All variations identified through this process are stored in a Curated Short Read archive, and the nsSNVs from the tumor samples are included in BioMuta. Currently, BioMuta has 26 cancer types with 13 896 small-scale and 308 986 large-scale study-derived variations. Integration of variation data allows identifications of novel or common nsSNVs that can be prioritized in validation studies.

32358997,ProNetView-ccRCC: A Web-Based Portal to Interactively Explore Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma Proteogenomics Networks.,"To better understand the molecular basis of cancer, the NCI's Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has been performing comprehensive large-scale proteogenomic characterizations of multiple cancer types. Gene and protein regulatory networks are subsequently being derived based on these proteogenomic profiles, which serve as tools to gain systems-level understanding of the molecular regulatory factories underlying these diseases. On the other hand, it remains a challenge to effectively visualize and navigate the resulting network models, which capture higher order structures in the proteogenomic profiles. There is a pressing need to have a new open community resource tool for intuitive visual exploration, interpretation, and communication of these gene/protein regulatory networks by the cancer research community. In this work, ProNetView-ccRCC (http://ccrcc.cptac-network-view.org/), an interactive web-based network exploration portal for investigating phosphopeptide co-expression network inferred based on the CPTAC clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) phosphoproteomics data is introduced.

27603513,SMEpred workbench: A web server for predicting efficacy of chemicallymodified siRNAs.,"Chemical modifications have been extensively exploited to circumvent shortcomings in therapeutic applications of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, experimental designing and testing of these siRNAs or chemically modified siRNAs (cm-siRNAs) involves enormous resources. Therefore, in-silico intervention in designing cm-siRNAs would be of utmost importance. We developed SMEpred workbench to predict the efficacy of normal siRNAs as well as cm-siRNAs using 3031 heterogeneous cm-siRNA sequences from siRNAmod database. These include 30 frequently used chemical modifications on different positions of either siRNA strand. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to develop predictive models utilizing various sequence features namely mono-, di-nucleotide composition, binary pattern and their hybrids. We achieved highest Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.80 during 10-fold cross validation and similar PCC value in independent validation. We have provided the algorithm in the 'SMEpred' pipeline to predict the normal siRNAs from the gene or mRNA sequence. For multiple modifications, we have assembled 'MultiModGen' module to design multiple modifications and further process them to evaluate their predicted efficacies.

In addition, SSRs represent a suitable marker type for sesame molecular breeding in developing countries where it is mainly grown. In this study, we identified 138,194 genome-wide SSRs of which 76.5% were physically mapped onto the 13 pseudo-chromosomes. Among these SSRs, up to three primers pairs were supplied for 101,930 SSRs and used to <i>in silico</i> amplify the reference genome together with two newly sequenced sesame accessions. A total of 79,957 SSRs (78%) were polymorphic between the three genomes thereby suggesting their promising use in different genomics-assisted breeding applications. From these polymorphic SSRs, 23 were selected and validated to have high polymorphic potential in 48 sesame accessions from different growing areas of Africa. Furthermore, we have developed an online user-friendly database, SisatBase (http://www.sesame-bioinfo.org/SisatBase/), which provides free access to SSRs data as well as an integrated platform for functional analyses.

Our approach relies on the comparison of di-nucleotides using BlosumR, a new log-odd substitution matrix. In order to use BlosumR for comparison, we recoded RNA sequences into protein-like sequences. We then showed that BlosumR can be used along with the BlastP algorithm in order to search non-coding RNA sequences. Using Rfam as a gold standard, we benchmarked this approach and show BlastR to be more sensitive than BlastN. We also show that BlastR is both faster and more sensitive than BlastP used with a single nucleotide log-odd substitution matrix. BlastR, when used in combination with WU-BlastP, is about 5% more accurate than WU-BlastN and about 50 times slower.

33391092,art.pics Database: An Open Access Database for Art Stimuli for Experimental Research.,"While art is omnipresent in human history, the neural mechanisms of how we perceive, value and differentiate art has only begun to be explored. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggested that art acts as secondary reward, involving brain activity in the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortices similar to primary rewards such as food. However, potential similarities or unique characteristics of art-related neuroscience (or neuroesthetics) remain elusive, also because of a lack of adequate experimental tools: the available collections of art stimuli often lack standard image definitions and normative ratings. Therefore, we here provide a large set of well-characterized, novel art images for use as visual stimuli in psychological and neuroimaging research. The stimuli were created using a deep learning algorithm that applied different styles of popular paintings (based on artists such as Klimt or Hundertwasser) on ordinary animal, plant and object images which were drawn from established visual stimuli databases. The novel stimuli represent mundane items with artistic properties with proposed reduced dimensionality and complexity compared to paintings. In total, 2,332 novel stimuli are available open access as ""art.pics"" database at https://osf.io/BTWNQ/ with standard image characteristics that are comparable to other common visual stimuli material in terms of size, variable color distribution, complexity, intensity and valence, measured by image software analysis and by ratings derived from a human experimental validation study [<i>n</i> = 1,296 (684f), age 30.2 ± 8.8 y.o.]. The experimental validation study further showed that the art.pics elicit a broad and significantly different variation in subjective value ratings (i.e., liking and wanting) as well as in recognizability, arousal and valence across different art styles and categories. Researchers are encouraged to study the perception, processing and valuation of art images based on the art.pics database which also enables real reward remuneration of the rated stimuli (as art prints) and a direct comparison to other rewards from e.g., food or money. <b>Key Messages:</b> We provide an open access, validated and large set of novel stimuli (<i>n</i> = 2,332) of standardized art images including normative rating data to be used for experimental research.

29073280,Pea Marker Database (PMD) - A new online database combining known pea (Pisum sativum L.) gene-based markers.,"Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is the oldest model object of plant genetics and one of the most agriculturally important legumes in the world. Since the pea genome has not been sequenced yet, identification of genes responsible for mutant phenotypes or desirable agricultural traits is usually performed via genetic mapping followed by candidate gene search. Such mapping is best carried out using gene-based molecular markers, as it opens the possibility for exploiting genome synteny between pea and its close relative Medicago truncatula Gaertn., possessing sequenced and annotated genome. In the last 5 years, a large number of pea gene-based molecular markers have been designed and mapped owing to the rapid evolution of ""next-generation sequencing"" technologies. However, the access to the complete set of markers designed worldwide is limited because the data are not uniformed and therefore hard to use. The Pea Marker Database was designed to combine the information about pea markers in a form of user-friendly and practical online tool. Version 1 (PMD1) comprises information about 2484 genic markers, including their locations in linkage groups, the sequences of corresponding pea transcripts and the names of related genes in M. truncatula. Version 2 (PMD2) is an updated version comprising 15944 pea markers in the same format with several advanced features. To test the performance of the PMD, fine mapping of pea symbiotic genes Sym13 and Sym27 in linkage groups VII and V, respectively, was carried out. The results of mapping allowed us to propose the Sen1 gene (a homologue of SEN1 gene of Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen) as the best candidate gene for Sym13, and to narrow the list of possible candidate genes for Sym27 to ten, thus proving PMD to be useful for pea gene mapping and cloning.

33407074,mixIndependR: a R package for statistical independence testing of loci in database of multi-locus genotypes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multi-locus genotype data are widely used in population genetics and disease studies. In evaluating the utility of multi-locus data, the independence of markers is commonly considered in many genomic assessments. Generally, pairwise non-random associations are tested by linkage disequilibrium; however, the dependence of one panel might be triplet, quartet, or other. Therefore, a compatible and user-friendly software is necessary for testing and assessing the global linkage disequilibrium among mixed genetic data.<h4>Results</h4>This study describes a software package for testing the mutual independence of mixed genetic datasets. Mutual independence is defined as no non-random associations among all subsets of the tested panel. The new R package ""mixIndependR"" calculates basic genetic parameters like allele frequency, genotype frequency, heterozygosity, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) by mutual independence from population data, regardless of the type of markers, such as simple nucleotide polymorphisms, short tandem repeats, insertions and deletions, and any other genetic markers. A novel method of assessing the dependence of mixed genetic panels is developed in this study and functionally analyzed in the software package. By comparing the observed distribution of two common summary statistics (the number of heterozygous loci [K] and the number of share alleles [X]) with their expected distributions under the assumption of mutual independence, the overall independence is tested.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The package ""mixIndependR"" is compatible to all categories of genetic markers and detects the overall non-random associations. Compared to pairwise disequilibrium, the approach described herein tends to have higher power, especially when number of markers is large. With this package, more multi-functional or stronger genetic panels can be developed, like mixed panels with different kinds of markers. In population genetics, the package ""mixIndependR"" makes it possible to discover more about admixture of populations, natural selection, genetic drift, and population demographics, as a more powerful method of detecting LD. Moreover, this new approach can optimize variants selection in disease studies and contribute to panel combination for treatments in multimorbidity. Application of this approach in real data is expected in the future, and this might bring a leap in the field of genetic technology.<h4>Availability</h4>The R package mixIndependR, is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixIndependR/index.html .",False,True,,0.6874066,mixindependr,,18.92374575,ok,,ixindependr,,v2,0.92374575,mixIndependR,True,True,True,,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixIndependR/index.html,https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixIndependR/index.html,True,...on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixIndependR/index.html .,1,False,False,False

With a design guided by usability studies, the system helps motivate researchers to perform dynamic computational experiments and explore relationships across data sets. For example, PlasmoDB users seeking novel therapeutic targets may wish to locate putative enzymes that distinguish pathogens from their hosts, and that are expressed during appropriate developmental stages. When a researcher runs one of the approximately 100 searches available on the site, the search is presented as a first step in a strategy. The strategy is extended by running additional searches, which are combined with set operators (union, intersect or minus), or genomic interval operators (overlap, contains). A graphical display uses Venn diagrams to make the strategy's flow obvious. The interface facilitates interactive adjustment of the component searches with changes propagating forward through the strategy. Users may save their strategies, creating protocols that can be shared with colleagues. The strategy system has now been deployed on all EuPathDB databases, and successfully deployed by other projects.

34820191,Biologically-oriented mud volcano database: muddy_db.,"Mud volcanoes (MVs) are naturally occurring hydrocarbon hotbeds with continuous methane discharge, contributing to global warming. They host microbial communities adapted to hydrocarbon oxidation. Given their research value, MVs still represent a niche topic in microbiology and are neglected by hydrocarbon-oriented research. All the data regarding MVs is sporadic and decentralized. To mitigate this problem, we built a custom Natural Language Processing pipeline (muddy_mine), and collected all the available MV data from open-access articles.

24253304,CR Cistrome: a ChIP-Seq database for chromatin regulators and histone modification linkages in human and mouse.,"Diversified histone modifications (HMs) are essential epigenetic features. They play important roles in fundamental biological processes including transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Chromatin regulators (CRs), which are indispensable in epigenetics, can mediate HMs to adjust chromatin structures and functions. With the development of ChIP-Seq technology, there is an opportunity to study CR and HM profiles at the whole-genome scale. However, no specific resource for the integration of CR ChIP-Seq data or CR-HM ChIP-Seq linkage pairs is currently available. Therefore, we constructed the CR Cistrome database, available online at http://compbio.tongji.edu.cn/cr and http://cistrome.org/cr/, to further elucidate CR functions and CR-HM linkages. Within this database, we collected all publicly available ChIP-Seq data on CRs in human and mouse and categorized the data into four cohorts: the reader, writer, eraser and remodeler cohorts, together with curated introductions and ChIP-Seq data analysis results. For the HM readers, writers and erasers, we provided further ChIP-Seq analysis data for the targeted HMs and schematized the relationships between them.

26980518,Fish Karyome version 2.1: a chromosome database of fishes and other aquatic organisms.,"A voluminous information is available on karyological studies of fishes; however, limited efforts were made for compilation and curation of the available karyological data in a digital form. 'Fish Karyome' database was the preliminary attempt to compile and digitize the available karyological information on finfishes belonging to the Indian subcontinent. But the database had limitations since it covered data only on Indian finfishes with limited search options. Perceiving the feedbacks from the users and its utility in fish cytogenetic studies, the Fish Karyome database was upgraded by applying Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP (pre hypertext processor) (LAMP) technologies. In the present version, the scope of the system was increased by compiling and curating the available chromosomal information over the globe on fishes and other aquatic organisms, such as echinoderms, molluscs and arthropods, especially of aquaculture importance. Thus, Fish Karyome version 2.1 presently covers 866 chromosomal records for 726 species supported with 253 published articles and the information is being updated regularly. The database provides information on chromosome number and morphology, sex chromosomes, chromosome banding, molecular cytogenetic markers, etc. supported by fish and karyotype images through interactive tools. It also enables the users to browse and view chromosomal information based on habitat, family, conservation status and chromosome number. The system also displays chromosome number in model organisms, protocol for chromosome preparation and allied techniques and glossary of cytogenetic terms. A data submission facility has also been provided through data submission panel. The database can serve as a unique and useful resource for cytogenetic characterization, sex determination, chromosomal mapping, cytotaxonomy, karyo-evolution and systematics of fishes.

29220461,SFMetaDB: a comprehensive annotation of mouse RNA splicing factor RNA-Seq datasets.,"Although the number of RNA-Seq datasets deposited publicly has increased over the past few years, incomplete annotation of the associated metadata limits their potential use. Because of the importance of RNA splicing in diseases and biological processes, we constructed a database called SFMetaDB by curating datasets related with RNA splicing factors. Our effort focused on the RNA-Seq datasets in which splicing factors were knocked-down, knocked-out or over-expressed, leading to 75 datasets corresponding to 56 splicing factors. These datasets can be used in differential alternative splicing analysis for the identification of the potential targets of these splicing factors and other functional studies. Surprisingly, only ∼15% of all the splicing factors have been studied by loss- or gain-of-function experiments using RNA-Seq. In particular, splicing factors with domains from a few dominant Pfam domain families have not been studied. This suggests a significant gap that needs to be addressed to fully elucidate the splicing regulatory landscape. Indeed, there are already mouse models available for ∼20 of the unstudied splicing factors, and it can be a fruitful research direction to study these splicing factors in vitro and in vivo using RNA-Seq.

23754576,Phi-square Lexical Competition Database (Phi-Lex): an online tool for quantifying auditory and visual lexical competition.,"A widely agreed-upon feature of spoken word recognition is that multiple lexical candidates in memory are simultaneously activated in parallel when a listener hears a word, and that those candidates compete for recognition (Luce, Goldinger, Auer, & Vitevitch, Perception 62:615-625, 2000; Luce & Pisoni, Ear and Hearing 19:1-36, 1998; McClelland & Elman, Cognitive Psychology 18:1-86, 1986). Because the presence of those competitors influences word recognition, much research has sought to quantify the processes of lexical competition. Metrics that quantify lexical competition continuously are more effective predictors of auditory and visual (lipread) spoken word recognition than are the categorical metrics traditionally used (Feld & Sommers, Speech Communication 53:220-228, 2011; Strand & Sommers, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 130:1663-1672, 2011). A limitation of the continuous metrics is that they are somewhat computationally cumbersome and require access to existing speech databases.

This ""guilt-by-association"" approach aims to find groups of genes with closely correlated expression profiles. Observation of consistent correlations across phenotypically diverse samples indicates that these genes have a shared function. We have recently described the application of weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to a 295 sample production CHO cell line microarray dataset and elucidated groups of genes related to growth rate and cell-specific productivity (Qp). In this study, we present the CHO gene coexpression database (CGCDB), a web-based system, designed specifically for researchers in the CHO community to provide user-friendly access to these gene-gene coexpression patterns. In addition to correlation between genes, the direct correlations between probesets and either growth rate or Qp are provided. Results are presented to the user via an interactive network diagram and in a downloadable tabular format.

32934280,Analysis of rice nuclear-localized seed-expressed proteins and their database (RSNP-DB).,"Nuclear proteins are primarily regulatory factors governing gene expression. Multiple factors determine the localization of a protein in the nucleus. An upright identification of nuclear proteins is way far from accuracy. We have attempted to combine information from subcellular prediction tools, experimental evidence, and nuclear proteome data to identify a reliable list of seed-expressed nuclear proteins in rice. Depending upon the number of prediction tools calling a protein nuclear, we could sort 19,441 seed expressed proteins into five categories. Of which, half of the seed-expressed proteins were called nuclear by at least one out of four prediction tools. Further, gene ontology (GO) enrichment and transcription factor composition analysis showed that 6116 seed-expressed proteins could be called nuclear with a greater assertion. Localization evidence from experimental data was available for 1360 proteins. Their analysis showed that a 92.04% accuracy of a nuclear call is valid for proteins predicted nuclear by at least three tools. Distribution of nuclear localization signals and nuclear export signals showed that the majority of category four members were nuclear resident proteins, whereas other categories have a low fraction of nuclear resident proteins and significantly higher constitution of shuttling proteins.

The present newfangled care in clinical research is to determine and to pick a new track for better treatment options for RA. Recent ethnopharmacological investigations revealed that traditional herbal remedies are the most preferred modality of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). However, several ayurvedic modes of treatments and formulations for RA are not much studied and documented from Indian traditional system of medicine. Therefore, this directed us to develop an integrated database, RAACFDb (acronym: Rheumatoid Arthritis Ayurvedic Classical Formulations Database) by consolidating data from the repository of Vedic Samhita - The Ayurveda to retrieve the available formulations information easily.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Literature data was gathered using several search engines and from ayurvedic practitioners for loading information in the database. In order to represent the collected information about classical ayurvedic formulations, an integrated database is constructed and implemented on a MySQL and PHP back-end.<h4>Results</h4>The database is supported by describing all the ayurvedic classical formulations for the treatment rheumatoid arthritis. It includes composition, usage, plant parts used, active ingredients present in the composition and their structures.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prime objective is to locate ayurvedic formulations proven to be quite successful and highly effective among the patients with reduced side effects.

28511181,1-CMDb: A Curated Database of Genomic Variations of the One-Carbon Metabolism Pathway.,"<h4>Background</h4>The one-carbon metabolism pathway is vital in maintaining tissue homeostasis by driving the critical reactions of folate and methionine cycles. A myriad of genetic and epigenetic events mark the rate of reactions in a tissue-specific manner. Integration of these to predict and provide personalized health management requires robust computational tools that can process multiomics data. The DNA sequences that may determine the chain of biological events and the endpoint reactions within one-carbon metabolism genes remain to be comprehensively recorded. Hence, we designed the one-carbon metabolism database (1-CMDb) as a platform to interrogate its association with a host of human disorders.<h4>Methods</h4>DNA sequence and network information of a total of 48 genes were extracted from a literature survey and KEGG pathway that are involved in the one-carbon folate-mediated pathway. The information generated, collected, and compiled for all these genes from the UCSC genome browser included the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), CpGs, copy number variations (CNVs), and miRNAs, and a comprehensive database was created. Furthermore, a significant correlation analysis was performed for SNPs in the pathway genes.<h4>Results</h4>Detailed data of SNPs, CNVs, CpG islands, and miRNAs for 48 folate pathway genes were compiled. The SNPs in CNVs (9670), CpGs (984), and miRNAs (14) were also compiled for all pathway genes. The SIFT score, the prediction and PolyPhen score, as well as the prediction for each of the SNPs were tabulated and represented for folate pathway genes. Also included in the database for folate pathway genes were the links to 124 various phenotypes and disease associations as reported in the literature and from publicly available information.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A comprehensive database was generated consisting of genomic elements within and among SNPs, CNVs, CpGs, and miRNAs of one-carbon metabolism pathways to facilitate (a) single source of information and (b) integration into large-genome scale network analysis to be developed in the future by the scientific community.

Cscan is a web resource that includes a large collection of genome-wide ChIP-Seq experiments performed on TFs, histone modifications, RNA polymerases and others. Enriched peak regions from the ChIP-Seq experiments are crossed with the genomic coordinates of a set of input genes, to identify which of the experiments present a statistically significant number of peaks within the input genes' loci. The input can be a cluster of co-expressed genes, or any other set of genes sharing a common regulatory profile. Users can thus single out which TFs are likely to be common regulators of the genes, and their respective correlations. Also, by examining results on promoter activation, transcription, histone modifications, polymerase binding and so on, users can investigate the effect of the TFs (activation or repression of transcription) as well as of the cell or tissue specificity of the genes' regulation and expression.

22126435,"Production of a reference transcriptome and transcriptomic database (PocilloporaBase) for the cauliflower coral, Pocillopora damicornis.","<h4>Background</h4>Motivated by the precarious state of the world's coral reefs, there is currently a keen interest in coral transcriptomics. By identifying changes in coral gene expression that are triggered by particular environmental stressors, we can begin to characterize coral stress responses at the molecular level, which should lead to the development of more powerful diagnostic tools for evaluating the health of corals in the field. Furthermore, the identification of genetic variants that are more or less resilient in the face of particular stressors will help us to develop more reliable prognoses for particular coral populations. Toward this end, we performed deep mRNA sequencing of the cauliflower coral, Pocillopora damicornis, a geographically widespread Indo-Pacific species that exhibits a great diversity of colony forms and is able to thrive in habitats subject to a wide range of human impacts. Importantly, P. damicornis is particularly amenable to laboratory culture. We collected specimens from three geographically isolated Hawaiian populations subjected to qualitatively different levels of human impact. We isolated RNA from colony fragments (""nubbins"") exposed to four environmental stressors (heat, desiccation, peroxide, and hypo-saline conditions) or control conditions.

25970262,ChSeq: A database of chameleon sequences.,"Chameleon sequences (ChSeqs) refer to sequence strings of identical amino acids that can adopt different conformations in protein structures. Researchers have detected and studied ChSeqs to understand the interplay between local and global interactions in protein structure formation. The different secondary structures adopted by one ChSeq challenge sequence-based secondary structure predictors. With increasing numbers of available Protein Data Bank structures, we here identify a large set of ChSeqs ranging from 6 to 10 residues in length. The homologous ChSeqs discovered highlight the structural plasticity involved in biological function. When compared with previous studies, the set of unrelated ChSeqs found represents an about 20-fold increase in the number of detected sequences, as well as an increase in the longest ChSeq length from 8 to 10 residues. We applied secondary structure predictors on our ChSeqs and found that methods based on a sequence profile outperformed methods based on a single sequence. For the unrelated ChSeqs, the evolutionary information provided by the sequence profile typically allows successful prediction of the prevailing secondary structure adopted in each protein family. Our dataset will facilitate future studies of ChSeqs, as well as interpretations of the interplay between local and nonlocal interactions.

21632604,Semantic-JSON: a lightweight web service interface for Semantic Web contents integrating multiple life science databases.,"Global cloud frameworks for bioinformatics research databases become huge and heterogeneous; solutions face various diametric challenges comprising cross-integration, retrieval, security and openness. To address this, as of March 2011 organizations including RIKEN published 192 mammalian, plant and protein life sciences databases having 8.2 million data records, integrated as Linked Open or Private Data (LOD/LPD) using SciNetS.org, the Scientists' Networking System. The huge quantity of linked data this database integration framework covers is based on the Semantic Web, where researchers collaborate by managing metadata across public and private databases in a secured data space. This outstripped the data query capacity of existing interface tools like SPARQL. Actual research also requires specialized tools for data analysis using raw original data. To solve these challenges, in December 2009 we developed the lightweight Semantic-JSON interface to access each fragment of linked and raw life sciences data securely under the control of programming languages popularly used by bioinformaticians such as Perl and Ruby. Researchers successfully used the interface across 28 million semantic relationships for biological applications including genome design, sequence processing, inference over phenotype databases, full-text search indexing and human-readable contents like ontology and LOD tree viewers.

Moreover, reference strains of mouse gut bacteria are not easily available, although mouse models are extensively used in medical research. These are major limitations for the investigation of intestinal microbiomes and their interactions with diet and host. It is thus important to study in detail the diversity and functions of gut microbiota members, including those colonizing the mouse intestine. To address these issues, we aimed at establishing the Mouse Intestinal Bacterial Collection (miBC), a public repository of bacterial strains and associated genomes from the mouse gut, and studied host-specificity of colonization and sequence-based relevance of the resource. The collection includes several strains representing novel species, genera and even one family. Genomic analyses showed that certain species are specific to the mouse intestine and that a minimal consortium of 18 strains covered 50-75% of the known functional potential of metagenomes. The present work will sustain future research on microbiota-host interactions in health and disease, as it will facilitate targeted colonization and molecular studies.

High-throughput experiments have identified m6A-peaks and sites across the transcriptome, but studies of m6A sites at the transcriptome-wide scale are limited to a few species and tissue types. Therefore, the computational prediction of mRNA m6A sites has become an important strategy. In this study, we integrated multiple features of mRNA (flanking sequences, local secondary structure information, and relative position information) and trained a SVM classifier to predict m6A sites in mammalian mRNA sequences. Our method achieves ideal performance in both cross-validation tests and rigorous independent dataset tests.

We have therefore developed ZINC20, a new version of ZINC with two major new features: billions of new molecules and new methods to search them. As a fully enumerated database, ZINC can be searched precisely using explicit atomic-level graph-based methods, such as SmallWorld for similarity and Arthor for pattern and substructure search, as well as 3D methods such as docking.

For instance, over 97% of the core Bemis-Murcko scaffolds in make-on-demand libraries are unavailable from ""in-stock"" collections. Correspondingly, the number of new Bemis-Murcko scaffolds is rising almost as a linear fraction of the elaborated molecules. Thus, an 88-fold increase in the number of molecules in the make-on-demand versus the in-stock sets is built upon a 16-fold increase in the number of Bemis-Murcko scaffolds.

However, a full combination of Raman and XRD results requires an appropriate and reliable reference database with complete information. This is already available for XRD. The main objective of this paper is to introduce and describe the recently developed Raman Open Database (ROD, http://solsa.crystallography.net/rod). It comprises a collection of high-quality uncorrected Raman spectra. The novelty of this database is its interconnectedness with other open databases like the Crystallography Open Database (http://www.crystallography.net/cod and Theoretical Crystallography Open Database (http://www.crystallography.net/tcod/). The syntax adopted to format entries in the ROD is based on the worldwide recognized and used CIF format, which offers a simple way for data exchange, writing and description. ROD also uses JCAMP-DX files as an alternative format for submitted spectra.

Quantitative MRI including fat fraction mapping using chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI has emerged for reliable determination of muscle volume and fat composition. The data analysis of water-fat images requires segmentation of the different muscles which has been mainly performed manually in the past and is a very time consuming process, currently limiting the clinical applicability. An automatization of the segmentation process would lead to a more time-efficient analysis. In the present work, the manually segmented thigh magnetic resonance imaging database MyoSegmenTUM is presented. It hosts water-fat MR images of both thighs of 15 healthy subjects and 4 patients with NMD with a voxel size of 3.2x2x4 mm3 with the corresponding segmentation masks for four functional muscle groups: quadriceps femoris, sartorius, gracilis, hamstrings. The database is freely accessible online at https://osf.io/svwa7/?view_only=c2c980c17b3a40fca35d088a3cdd83e2. The database is mainly meant as ground truth which can be used as training and test dataset for automatic muscle segmentation algorithms.

They catalyze the oxidation of many, particularly phenolic substances, and, besides playing an important role in many cellular activities, are of interest in biotechnological applications. The Laccase Engineering Database (LccED, http://www.lcced.uni-stuttgart.de) was designed to serve as a tool for a systematic sequence-based classification and analysis of the diverse multicopper oxidase protein family. More than 2200 proteins were classified into 11 superfamilies and 56 homologous families. For each family, the LccED provides multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees and family-specific HMM profiles. The integration of structures for 14 different proteins allows a comprehensive comparison of sequences and structures to derive biochemical properties. Among the families, the distribution of the proteins regarding different kingdoms was investigated. The database was applied to perform a comprehensive analysis by MCO- and laccase-specific patterns. The LccED combines information of sequences and structures of MCOs.

Its goal is to generate an informed and current understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the iconic cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Initially, reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases were integrated into a single, newly created site, www.brcaexchange.org. The purpose of the BRCA Exchange is to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. More than 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number found in the next-largest public database at the project's outset, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases-Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD)-as well as population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together the existing international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium expert panel, along with expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, all with a common goal of advancing our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data to encourage data sharing, development of methods suitable for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2.",False,True,,0.6793131,brca challenge,,17.9709992,ok,,clinvar | brca exchange | network for | interpretation of germline,bic | brca,v2,0.9709992,BRCA Challenge,True,True,True,,http://www.brcaexchange.org,http://www.brcaexchange.org,True,,1,False,False,False

CR events lead to their associated diseases by disrupting gene and protein structures. Also, they can lead to diseases through changes in chromosomal 3D structure and gene expression. In this study, we search for CR-associated diseases potentially caused by chromosomal 3D structure alteration by integrating Hi-C and ChIP-seq data. Our algorithm rediscovers experimentally verified disease-associated CRs (polydactyly diseases) that alter gene expression by disrupting chromosome 3D structure. Interestingly, we find that intellectual disability may be a candidate disease caused by 3D chromosome structure alteration.

30963208,Mapping the diversity of microbial lignin catabolism: experiences from the eLignin database.,"Lignin is a heterogeneous aromatic biopolymer and a major constituent of lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood and agricultural residues. Despite the high amount of aromatic carbon present, the severe recalcitrance of the lignin macromolecule makes it difficult to convert into value-added products. In nature, lignin and lignin-derived aromatic compounds are catabolized by a consortia of microbes specialized at breaking down the natural lignin and its constituents. In an attempt to bridge the gap between the fundamental knowledge on microbial lignin catabolism, and the recently emerging field of applied biotechnology for lignin biovalorization, we have developed the eLignin Microbial Database ( www.elignindatabase.com ), an openly available database that indexes data from the lignin bibliome, such as microorganisms, aromatic substrates, and metabolic pathways.

22611131,Gossamer--a resource-efficient de novo assembler.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The de novo assembly of short read high-throughput sequencing data poses significant computational challenges. The volume of data is huge; the reads are tiny compared to the underlying sequence, and there are significant numbers of sequencing errors. There are numerous software packages that allow users to assemble short reads, but most are either limited to relatively small genomes (e.g. bacteria) or require large computing infrastructure or employ greedy algorithms and thus often do not yield high-quality results.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed Gossamer, an implementation of the de Bruijn approach to assembly that requires close to the theoretical minimum of memory, but still allows efficient processing.

30196491,Use of IMGT<sup>®</sup> Databases and Tools for Antibody Engineering and Humanization.,"IMGT<sup>®</sup>, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system<sup>®</sup> ( http://www.imgt.org ), was created in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Université de Montpellier and CNRS) to manage the huge diversity of the antigen receptors, immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, and T cell receptors (TR). The founding of IMGT<sup>®</sup> marked the advent of immunoinformatics, which emerged at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformatics. Standardized sequence and structure analysis of antibody using IMGT<sup>®</sup> databases and tools allow one to bridge, for the first time, the gap between antibody sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures. This is achieved through the IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of classification (IMGT gene and allele nomenclature), description (IMGT standardized labels), and numerotation (IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Collier de Perles). IMGT<sup>®</sup> is acknowledged as the global reference for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics, and its standards are particularly useful for antibody engineering and humanization. IMGT<sup>®</sup> databases for antibody nucleotide sequences and genes include IMGT/LIGM-DB and IMGT/GENE-DB, respectively, and nucleotide sequence analysis is performed by the IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis tools and for NGS by IMGT/HighV-QUEST. In this chapter, we focus on IMGT<sup>®</sup> databases and tools for amino acid sequences, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures: the IMGT/DomainGapAlign and IMGT Collier de Perles tools and the IMGT/2Dstructure-DB and IMGT/3Dstructure-DB database. IMGT/mAb-DB provides the query interface for monoclonal antibodies (mAb), fusion proteins for immune applications (FPIA), and composite proteins for clinical applications (CPCA) and related proteins of interest (RPI) and links to the proposed and recommended lists of the World Health Organization International Nonproprietary Name (WHO INN) programme, to IMGT/2Dstructure-DB for amino acid sequences, and to IMGT/3Dstructure-DB and its associated tools (IMGT/StructuralQuery, IMGT/DomainSuperimpose) for crystallized antibodies.",False,True,,0.67282546,,imgt,17.95293343,ok,,,fpia | ab-db,v2,0.95293343,,True,False,False,,http://www.imgt.org,http://www.imgt.org,True,"...l ImMunoGeneTics information system<sup>®</sup> ( http://www.imgt.org ), was created in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Un...",1,False,False,False
28821228,SG-ADVISER mtDNA: a web server for mitochondrial DNA annotation with data from 200 samples of a healthy aging cohort.,"<h4>Background</h4>Whole genome and exome sequencing usually include reads containing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Yet, state-of-the-art pipelines and services for human nuclear genome variant calling and annotation do not handle mitochondrial genome data appropriately. As a consequence, any researcher desiring to add mtDNA variant analysis to their investigations is forced to explore the literature for mtDNA pipelines, evaluate them, and implement their own instance of the desired tool. This task is far from trivial, and can be prohibitive for non-bioinformaticians.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed SG-ADVISER mtDNA, a web server to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of mtDNA genomic data coming from next generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. The server was built in the context of our SG-ADVISER framework and on top of the MtoolBox platform (Calabrese et al., Bioinformatics 30(21):3115-3117, 2014), and includes most of its functionalities (i.e., assembly of mitochondrial genomes, heteroplasmic fractions, haplogroup assignment, functional and prioritization analysis of mitochondrial variants) as well as a back-end and a front-end interface. The server has been tested with unpublished data from 200 individuals of a healthy aging cohort (Erikson et al., Cell 165(4):1002-1011, 2016) and their data is made publicly available here along with a preliminary analysis of the variants. We observed that individuals over ~90 years old carried low levels of heteroplasmic variants in their genomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SG-ADVISER mtDNA is a fast and functional tool that allows for variant calling and annotation of human mtDNA data coming from NGS experiments. The server was built with simplicity in mind, and builds on our own experience in interpreting mtDNA variants in the context of sudden death and rare diseases.

Antibody therapeutics hold enormous promise for the treatment of COVID-19. In March 2020, the Chinese Antibody Society, in collaboration with The Antibody Society, initiated the ""COVID-19 Antibody Therapeutics Tracker"" (""Tracker"") (https://chineseantibody.org/covid-19-track/) program to track the antibody-based COVID-19 interventions in preclinical and clinical development globally. The data are collected from the public domain and verified by volunteers on an ongoing basis. Here, we present exploratory data analyses and visualization to demonstrate the latest trends of COVID-19 antibody development, based on data for over 150 research and development programs and molecules included in the ""Tracker"" as of 8 August 2020. We categorized the data mainly by their targets, formats, development status, developers and country of origin. Although details are limited in some cases, all of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody candidates appear to target the viral spike protein (S protein), and most are full-length monoclonal antibodies. Most of the current COVID-19 antibody therapeutic candidates in clinical trials are repurposed drugs aimed at targets other than virus-specific proteins, while most of these virus-specific therapeutic antibodies are in discovery or preclinical studies. As of 8 August 2020, eight antibody candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein have entered clinical studies, including LY-CoV555, REGN-COV2, JS016, TY027, CT-P59, BRII-196, BRII-198 and SCTA01.

26624790,SpinCouple: Development of a Web Tool for Analyzing Metabolite Mixtures via Two-Dimensional J-Resolved NMR Database.,"A new Web-based tool, SpinCouple, which is based on the accumulation of a two-dimensional (2D) (1)H-(1)H J-resolved NMR database from 598 metabolite standards, has been developed. The spectra include both J-coupling and (1)H chemical shift information; those are applicable to a wide array of spectral annotation, especially for metabolic mixture samples that are difficult to label through the attachment of (13)C isotopes. In addition, the user-friendly application includes an absolute-quantitative analysis tool. Good agreement was obtained between known concentrations of 20-metabolite mixtures versus the calibration curve-based quantification results obtained from 2D-Jres spectra.

29373760,Automated annotation of mobile antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria: the Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Annotator (MARA) and database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria is often due to acquisition of several different antibiotic resistance genes, each associated with a different mobile genetic element, that tend to cluster together in complex conglomerations. Accurate, consistent annotation of resistance genes, the boundaries and fragments of mobile elements, and signatures of insertion, such as DR, facilitates comparative analysis of complex multiresistance regions and plasmids to better understand their evolution and how resistance genes spread.<h4>Objectives</h4>To extend the Repository of Antibiotic resistance Cassettes (RAC) web site, which includes a database of 'features', and the Attacca automatic DNA annotation system, to encompass additional resistance genes and all types of associated mobile elements.<h4>Methods</h4>Antibiotic resistance genes and mobile elements were added to RAC, from existing registries where possible. Attacca grammars were extended to accommodate the expanded database, to allow overlapping features to be annotated and to identify and annotate features such as composite transposons and DR.<h4>Results</h4>The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Annotator (MARA) database includes antibiotic resistance genes and selected mobile elements from Gram-negative bacteria, distinguishing important variants. Sequences can be submitted to the MARA web site for annotation. A list of positions and orientations of annotated features, indicating those that are truncated, DR and potential composite transposons is provided for each sequence, as well as a diagram showing annotated features approximately to scale.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The MARA web site (http://mara.spokade.com) provides a comprehensive database for mobile antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria and accurately annotates resistance genes and associated mobile elements in submitted sequences to facilitate comparative analysis.",False,True,,0.70253974,,mara,17.89321584,ok,mara | multiple antibiotic resistance annotator,repository of antibiotic resistance cassettes | multiple antibiotic resistance annotator,rac,v2,0.89321584,Automated annotation of mobile antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria,True,False,False,,http://mara.spokade.com,http://mara.spokade.com,True,...y to scale.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The MARA web site (http://mara.spokade.com) provides a comprehensive database for mobile ant...,1,False,False,False

26646737,The Polish Genetic Database of Victims of Totalitarianisms.,"This paper describes the creation of the Polish Genetic Database of Victims of Totalitarianism and the first research conducted under this project. On September 28th 2012, the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin and the Institute of National Remembrance-Commission for Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation agreed to support the creation of the Polish Genetic Database of Victims of Totalitarianism (PBGOT, www.pbgot.pl). The purpose was to employ state-of-the-art methods of forensic genetics to identify the remains of unidentified victims of Communist and Nazi totalitarian regimes. The database was designed to serve as a central repository of genetic information of the victim's DNA and that of the victim's nearest living relatives, with the goal of making a positive identification of the victim. Along the way, PGBOT encountered several challenges. First, extracting useable DNA samples from the remains of individuals who had been buried for over half a century required forensic geneticists to create special procedures and protocols. Second, obtaining genetic reference material and historical information from the victim's closest relatives was both problematic and urgent. The victim's nearest living relatives were part of a dying generation, and the opportunity to obtain the best genetic and historical information about the victims would soon die with them. For this undertaking, PGBOT assembled a team of historians, archaeologists, forensic anthropologists, and forensic geneticists from several European research institutions. The field work was divided into five broad categories: (1) exhumation of victim remains and storing their biological material for later genetic testing; (2) researching archives and historical data for a more complete profile of those killed or missing and the families that lost them; (3) locating the victim's nearest relatives to obtain genetic reference samples (swabs), (4) entering the genetic data from both victims and family members into a common database; (5) making a conclusive, final identification of the victim. PGBOT's first project was to identify victims of the Communist regime buried in hidden mass graves in the Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw. Throughout 2012 and 2013, PGBOT carried out archaeological exhumations in the Powązki Military Cemetery that resulted in the recovery of the skeletal remains of 194 victims in several mass graves. Of the 194 sets of remains, more than 50 victims have been successfully matched and identified through genetic evidence.",False,True,,0.65926707,polish genetic database,,17.8107087,ok,,polish genetic database of victims of,pbgot | pgbot,v2,0.8107087,,True,False,False,,http://www.pbgot.pl,http://www.pbgot.pl,True,,1,False,False,False
31976536,Human Breathomics Database.,"Breathomics is a special branch of metabolomics that quantifies volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from collected exhaled breath samples. Understanding how breath molecules are related to diseases, mechanisms and pathways identified from experimental analytical measurements is challenging due to the lack of an organized resource describing breath molecules, related references and biomedical information embedded in the literature. To provide breath VOCs, related references and biomedical information, we aim to organize a database composed of manually curated information and automatically extracted biomedical information. First, VOCs-related disease information was manually organized from 207 literature linked to 99 VOCs and known Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Then an automated text mining algorithm was used to extract biomedical information from this literature. In the end, the manually curated information and auto-extracted biomedical information was combined to form a breath molecule database-the Human Breathomics Database (HBDB). We first manually curated and organized disease information including MeSH term from 207 literatures associated with 99 VOCs. Then, an automatic pipeline of text mining approach was used to collect 2766 literatures and extract biomedical information from breath researches. We combined curated information with automatically extracted biomedical information to assemble a breath molecule database, the HBDB. The HBDB is a database that includes references, VOCs and diseases associated with human breathomics. Most of these VOCs were detected in human breath samples or exhaled breath condensate samples. So far, the database contains a total of 913 VOCs in relation to human exhaled breath researches reported in 2766 publications. The HBDB is the most comprehensive HBDB of VOCs in human exhaled breath to date. It is a useful and organized resource for researchers and clinicians to identify and further investigate potential biomarkers from the breath of patients.

To complement variant-driven disease gene discovery, here we present function-driven disease gene discovery in zebrafish (Danio rerio), a promising human disease model owing to its high anatomical and genomic similarity to humans. To facilitate zebrafish-based function-driven disease gene discovery, we developed a genome-scale co-functional network of zebrafish genes, DanioNet (www.inetbio.org/danionet), which was constructed by Bayesian integration of genomics big data. Rigorous statistical assessment confirmed the high prediction capacity of DanioNet for a wide variety of human diseases. To demonstrate the feasibility of the function-driven disease gene discovery using DanioNet, we predicted genes for ciliopathies and performed experimental validation for eight candidate genes. We also validated the existence of heterozygous rare variants in the candidate genes of individuals with ciliopathies yet not in controls derived from the UK10K consortium, suggesting that these variants are potentially involved in enhancing the risk of ciliopathies.

23355415,eChickAtlas: an introduction to the database.,"The precise control of gene expression is critical in embryonic development. Quantitative assays, such as microarrays and RNA sequencing, provide gene expression levels for a large number of genes, but do not contain spatial information. In contrast, in situ methods, such as in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, provide spatial resolution, but poor quantification and can only reveal the expression of one, or very few genes at a time. Furthermore, the usual methods of documenting the results, by photographing whole mounts or sections, makes it very difficult to assess the three-dimensional (3D) relationships between expressing and nonexpressing cells. Optical projection tomography (OPT) can capture the full 3D expression pattern in a whole embryo at a reasonable level of resolution and at moderately high throughput. A large database containing spatio-temporal patterns of expression for the mouse (e-Mouse Atlas Project, EMAP, www.emouseatlas.org) has been created, incorporating 3D information. Like the mouse, the chick is an important model in developmental biology and translational studies. To facilitate comparisons between these important model organisms, we have created a 3D anatomical atlas, accompanied by an anatomical ontology of the chick embryo and a database of gene expression patterns during chick development.

Presently, more than 15 peptide-based drugs are in various stages of clinical trials. Emerging and re-emerging viruses further emphasize the efforts to accelerate antiviral drug discovery efforts. Despite, huge importance of the field, no dedicated AVP resource is available. In the present study, we have collected 1245 peptides which were experimentally checked for antiviral activity targeting important human viruses like influenza, HIV, HCV and SARS, etc. After removing redundant peptides, 1056 peptides were divided into 951 training and 105 validation data sets. We have exploited various peptides sequence features, i.e. motifs and alignment followed by amino acid composition and physicochemical properties during 5-fold cross validation using Support Vector Machine. Physiochemical properties-based model achieved maximum 85% accuracy and 0.70 Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Performance of this model on the experimental validation data set showed 86% accuracy and 0.71 MCC which is far better than the general antimicrobial peptides prediction methods.

33008298,Database: web application for visualization of the cumulated RNAseq data against the salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana.,"<h4>Background</h4>Plants have adapted to survive under adverse conditions or exploit favorable conditions in response to their environment as sessile creatures. In a way of plant adaptation, plant hormones have been evolved to efficiently use limited resources. Plant hormones including auxin, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene have been studied to reveal their role in plant adaptation against their environment by phenotypic observation with experimental design such as mutation on hormone receptors and treatment / non-treatment of plant hormones along with other environmental conditions. With the development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, it became possible to score the total gene expression of the sampled plants and estimate the degree of effect of plant hormones in gene expression. This allowed us to infer the signaling pathway through plant hormones, which greatly stimulated the study of functional genomics using mutants. Due to the continued development of NGS technology and analytical techniques, many plant hormone-related studies have produced and accumulated NGS-based data, especially RNAseq data have been stored in the sequence read archive represented by NCBI, EBI, and DDBJ.<h4>Description</h4>Here, hormone treatment RNAseq data of Arabidopsis (Col0), wild-type genotype, were collected with mock, SA, and MeJA treatments. The genes affected by hormones were identified through a machine learning approach. The degree of expression of the affected gene was quantified, visualized in boxplot using d3 (data-driven-document), and the database was built by Django.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using this database, we created a web application ( http://pgl.gnu.ac.kr/hormoneDB/ ) that lists hormone-related or hormone-affected genes and visualizes the boxplot of the gene expression of selected genes.

28077567,FARME DB: a functional antibiotic resistance element database.,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a major global public health threat but few resources exist that catalog AR genes outside of a clinical context. Current AR sequence databases are assembled almost exclusively from genomic sequences derived from clinical bacterial isolates and thus do not include many microbial sequences derived from environmental samples that confer resistance in functional metagenomic studies. These environmental metagenomic sequences often show little or no similarity to AR sequences from clinical isolates using standard classification criteria. In addition, existing AR databases provide no information about flanking sequences containing regulatory or mobile genetic elements. To help address this issue, we created an annotated database of DNA and protein sequences derived exclusively from environmental metagenomic sequences showing AR in laboratory experiments. Our Functional Antibiotic Resistant Metagenomic Element (FARME) database is a compilation of publically available DNA sequences and predicted protein sequences conferring AR as well as regulatory elements, mobile genetic elements and predicted proteins flanking antibiotic resistant genes.

33676410,SPRD: a surface plasmon resonance database of common factors for better experimental planning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Surface plasmon resonance is a label-free biophysical technique that is widely used in investigating biomolecular interactions, including protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-small molecule binding. Surface plasmon resonance is a very powerful tool in different stages of small molecule drug development and antibody characterization. Both academic institutions and pharmaceutical industry extensively utilize this method for screening and validation studies involving direct molecular interactions. In most applications of the surface plasmon resonance technology, one of the studied molecules is immobilized on a microchip, while the second molecule is delivered through a microfluidic system over the immobilized molecules. Changes in total mass on the chip surface is recorded in real time as an indicator of the molecular interactions.<h4>Main body</h4>Quality and accuracy of the surface plasmon resonance data depend on experimental variables, including buffer composition, type of sensor chip, coupling chemistry of molecules on the sensor surface, and surface regeneration conditions. These technical details are generally included in materials and methods sections of published manuscripts and are not easily accessible using the common internet browser search engines or PubMed. Herein, we introduce a surface plasmon resonance database, www.sprdatabase.info that contains technical details extracted from 5140 publications with surface plasmon resonance data. We also provide an analysis of experimental conditions preferred by different laboratories. These experimental variables can be searched within the database and help future users of this technology to design better experiments.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Amine coupling and CM5 chips were the most common methods used for immobilizing proteins in surface plasmon resonance experiments. However, number of different chips, capture methods and buffer conditions were used by multiple investigators. We predict that the database will significantly help the scientific community using this technology and hope that users will provide feedback to improve and expand the database indefinitely.

More than 10 different types of programmed cell death forms have been discovered. Several proteomics analyses have been performed to gain insight in proteins involved in the different forms of programmed cell death. To consolidate these studies, we have developed the cell death proteomics (CDP) database, which comprehends data from apoptosis, autophagy, cytotoxic granule-mediated cell death, excitotoxicity, mitotic catastrophe, paraptosis, pyroptosis, and Wallerian degeneration. The CDP database is available as a web-based database to compare protein identifications and quantitative information across different experimental setups.

31101011,Development of a transcriptomic database for 14 species of scleractinian corals.,"<h4>Background</h4>Scleractinian corals are important reef builders, but around the world they are under the threat of global climate change as well as local stressors. Molecular resources are critical for understanding a species' stress responses and resilience to the changing environment, but such resources are unavailable for most scleractinian corals, especially those distributed in the South China Sea. We therefore aimed to provide transcriptome resources for 14 common species, including a few structure forming species, in the South China Sea.<h4>Description</h4>We sequenced the transcriptome of 14 species of scleractinian corals using high-throughput RNA-seq and conducted de novo assembly. For each species, we produced 7.4 to 12.0 gigabases of reads, and assembled them into 271 to 762 thousand contigs with a N50 value of 629 to 1427 bp. These contigs included 66 to 114 thousand unigenes with a predicted open reading frame, and 74.3 to 80.5% of the unigenes were functionally annotated. In the azooxanthelate species Tubastraea coccinea, 41.5% of the unigenes had at least a best-hit sequence from corals. In the other thirteen species, 20.2 to 48.9% of the annotated unigenes had best-hit sequences from corals, and 28.3 to 51.6% from symbiotic algae belonging to the family Symbiodinaceae. With these resources, we developed a transcriptome database (CoralTBase) which features online BLAST and keyword search for unigenes/functional terms through a user friendly Internet interface.<h4>Short conclusion</h4>We developed comprehensive transcriptome resources for 14 species of scleractinian corals and constructed a publicly accessible database ( www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/CoralTBase ).

Although there is a huge amount of information on RNA structures in PDB, there are redundant files, ambiguous synthetic sequences etc. Moreover, a systematic hierarchical organization, reflecting RNA classification, is missing in PDB. In this investigation, we have classified all the available RNA structures from PDB through a programmatic approach. Hence, it would be now a simple assignment to regularly update the classification as and when new structures are released. The classification can further determine (i) a non-redundant set of RNA structures and (ii) if available, a set of structures of identical sequence and function, which can highlight structural polymorphism, ligand-induced conformational alterations etc. Presently, we have classified the available structures (2095 PDB entries having RNA chain longer than nine nucleotides solved by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy) into nine functional classes.

23209799,The duplicated genes database: identification and functional annotation of co-localised duplicated genes across genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>There has been a surge in studies linking genome structure and gene expression, with special focus on duplicated genes. Although initially duplicated from the same sequence, duplicated genes can diverge strongly over evolution and take on different functions or regulated expression. However, information on the function and expression of duplicated genes remains sparse. Identifying groups of duplicated genes in different genomes and characterizing their expression and function would therefore be of great interest to the research community. The 'Duplicated Genes Database' (DGD) was developed for this purpose.<h4>Methodology</h4>Nine species were included in the DGD. For each species, BLAST analyses were conducted on peptide sequences corresponding to the genes mapped on a same chromosome. Groups of duplicated genes were defined based on these pairwise BLAST comparisons and the genomic location of the genes. For each group, Pearson correlations between gene expression data and semantic similarities between functional GO annotations were also computed when the relevant information was available.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Duplicated Gene Database provides a list of co-localised and duplicated genes for several species with the available gene co-expression level and semantic similarity value of functional annotation. Adding these data to the groups of duplicated genes provides biological information that can prove useful to gene expression analyses.

21491493,Integrating the intrinsic conformational preferences of noncoded α-amino acids modified at the peptide bond into the noncoded amino acids database.,"Recently, we reported a database (Noncoded Amino acids Database; http://recerca.upc.edu/imem/index.htm) that was built to compile information about the intrinsic conformational preferences of nonproteinogenic residues determined by quantum mechanical calculations, as well as bibliographic information about their synthesis, physical and spectroscopic characterization, the experimentally established conformational propensities, and applications (Revilla-López et al., J Phys Chem B 2010;114:7413-7422). The database initially contained the information available for α-tetrasubstituted α-amino acids. In this work, we extend NCAD to three families of compounds, which can be used to engineer peptides and proteins incorporating modifications at the--NHCO--peptide bond. Such families are: N-substituted α-amino acids, thio-α-amino acids, and diamines and diacids used to build retropeptides. The conformational preferences of these compounds have been analyzed and described based on the information captured in the database. In addition, we provide an example of the utility of the database and of the compounds it compiles in protein and peptide engineering.

34234809,Tissue Resources for the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes.,"In order to generate an atlas of the functional elements driving genome expression in domestic animals, the Functional Annotation of Animal Genome (FAANG) strategy was to sample many tissues from a few animals of different species, sexes, ages, and production stages. This article presents the collection of tissue samples for four species produced by two pilot projects, at INRAE (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment) and the University of California, Davis. There were three mammals (cattle, goat, and pig) and one bird (chicken). It describes the metadata characterizing these reference sets (1) for animals with origin and selection history, physiological status, and environmental conditions; (2) for samples with collection site and tissue/cell processing; (3) for quality control; and (4) for storage and further distribution. Three sets are identified: set 1 comprises tissues for which collection can be standardized and for which representative aliquots can be easily distributed (liver, spleen, lung, heart, fat depot, skin, muscle, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells); set 2 comprises tissues requiring special protocols because of their cellular heterogeneity (brain, digestive tract, secretory organs, gonads and gametes, reproductive tract, immune tissues, cartilage); set 3 comprises specific cell preparations (immune cells, tracheal epithelial cells). Dedicated sampling protocols were established and uploaded in https://data.faang.org/protocol/samples. Specificities between mammals and chicken are described when relevant. A total of 73 different tissues or tissue sections were collected, and 21 are common to the four species. Having a common set of tissues will facilitate the transfer of knowledge within and between species and will contribute to decrease animal experimentation. Combining data on the same samples will facilitate data integration. Quality control was performed on some tissues with RNA extraction and RNA quality control. More than 5,000 samples have been stored with unique identifiers, and more than 4,000 were uploaded onto the Biosamples database, provided that standard ontologies were available to describe the sample. Many tissues have already been used to implement FAANG assays, with published results. All samples are available without restriction for further assays. The requesting procedure is described.

22434839,A hybrid human and machine resource curation pipeline for the Neuroscience Information Framework.,"The breadth of information resources available to researchers on the Internet continues to expand, particularly in light of recently implemented data-sharing policies required by funding agencies. However, the nature of dense, multifaceted neuroscience data and the design of contemporary search engine systems makes efficient, reliable and relevant discovery of such information a significant challenge. This challenge is specifically pertinent for online databases, whose dynamic content is 'hidden' from search engines. The Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF; http://www.neuinfo.org) was funded by the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research to address the problem of finding and utilizing neuroscience-relevant resources such as software tools, data sets, experimental animals and antibodies across the Internet. From the outset, NIF sought to provide an accounting of available resources, whereas developing technical solutions to finding, accessing and utilizing them. The curators therefore, are tasked with identifying and registering resources, examining data, writing configuration files to index and display data and keeping the contents current. In the initial phases of the project, all aspects of the registration and curation processes were manual. However, as the number of resources grew, manual curation became impractical. This report describes our experiences and successes with developing automated resource discovery and semiautomated type characterization with text-mining scripts that facilitate curation team efforts to discover, integrate and display new content. We also describe the DISCO framework, a suite of automated web services that significantly reduce manual curation efforts to periodically check for resource updates. Lastly, we discuss DOMEO, a semi-automated annotation tool that improves the discovery and curation of resources that are not necessarily website-based (i.e. reagents, software tools). Although the ultimate goal of automation was to reduce the workload of the curators, it has resulted in valuable analytic by-products that address accessibility, use and citation of resources that can now be shared with resource owners and the larger scientific community.

22940442,miRNA_Targets: a database for miRNA target predictions in coding and non-coding regions of mRNAs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in most eukaryotes. They help in fine-tuning gene expression by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNA). The interactions of miRNAs and mRNAs are sequence specific and computational tools have been developed to predict miRNA target sites on mRNAs, but miRNA research has been mainly focused on target sites within 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes. There is a need for an easily accessible repository of genome wide full length mRNA - miRNA target predictions with versatile search capabilities and visualization tools. We have created a web accessible database of miRNA target predictions for human, mouse, cow, chicken, Zebra fish, fruit fly and Caenorhabditis elegans using two different target prediction algorithms, The database has target predictions for miRNA's on 5' UTRs, coding region and 3' UTRs of all mRNAs.

26578582,Enhanced annotations and features for comparing thousands of Pseudomonas genomes in the Pseudomonas genome database.,"The Pseudomonas Genome Database (http://www.pseudomonas.com) is well known for the application of community-based annotation approaches for producing a high-quality Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome annotation, and facilitating whole-genome comparative analyses with other Pseudomonas strains. To aid analysis of potentially thousands of complete and draft genome assemblies, this database and analysis platform was upgraded to integrate curated genome annotations and isolate metadata with enhanced tools for larger scale comparative analysis and visualization. Manually curated gene annotations are supplemented with improved computational analyses that help identify putative drug targets and vaccine candidates or assist with evolutionary studies by identifying orthologs, pathogen-associated genes and genomic islands. The database schema has been updated to integrate isolate metadata that will facilitate more powerful analysis of genomes across datasets in the future. We continue to place an emphasis on providing high-quality updates to gene annotations through regular review of the scientific literature and using community-based approaches including a major new Pseudomonas community initiative for the assignment of high-quality gene ontology terms to genes.

For example, when a given miRNA is transcribed, true targets of that miRNA should tend to have lower expression levels relative to when the miRNA is not expressed.<h4>Methods</h4>We processed publicly available human RNA-seq experiments obtained from NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) to identify miRNA-mRNA co-expression trends and summarized them in terms of their Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and significance.<h4>Results</h4>We found that sequence-derived parameters from TargetScan and miRanda were predictive of co-expression, and that TargetScan- and miRanda-derived gene-miRNA pairs tend to have anti-correlated expression patterns in RNA-seq data compared to controls.

Among them cardiotoxicity remains the main reason, despite the substantial effort put into in vitro and in vivo testing, with the main focus put on hERG channel inhibition as the hypothesized surrogate of drug proarrhythmic potency. The large interest in the IKr current has resulted in the development of predictive tools and informative databases describing a drug's susceptibility to interactions with the hERG channel, although there are no similar, publicly available sets of data describing other ionic currents driven by the human cardiomyocyte ionic channels, which are recognized as an overlooked drug safety target.<h4>Discussion</h4>The aim of this database development and publication was to provide a scientifically useful, easily usable and clearly verifiable set of information describing not only IKr (hERG), but also other human cardiomyocyte specific ionic channels inhibition data (IKs, INa, ICa).<h4>Summary</h4>The broad range of data (chemical space and in vitro settings) and the easy to use user interface makes tox-database.net a useful tool for interested scientists.

32559296,Automated generation of gene summaries at the Alliance of Genome Resources.,"Short paragraphs that describe gene function, referred to as gene summaries, are valued by users of biological knowledgebases for the ease with which they convey key aspects of gene function. Manual curation of gene summaries, while desirable, is difficult for knowledgebases to sustain. We developed an algorithm that uses curated, structured gene data at the Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance; www.alliancegenome.org) to automatically generate gene summaries that simulate natural language. The gene data used for this purpose include curated associations (annotations) to ontology terms from the Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology, model organism knowledgebase (MOK)-specific anatomy ontologies and Alliance orthology data. The method uses sentence templates for each data category included in the gene summary in order to build a natural language sentence from the list of terms associated with each gene. To improve readability of the summaries when numerous gene annotations are present, we developed a new algorithm that traverses ontology graphs in order to group terms by their common ancestors. The algorithm optimizes the coverage of the initial set of terms and limits the length of the final summary, using measures of information content of each ontology term as a criterion for inclusion in the summary. The automated gene summaries are generated with each Alliance release, ensuring that they reflect current data at the Alliance. Our method effectively leverages category-specific curation efforts of the Alliance member databases to create modular, structured and standardized gene summaries for seven member species of the Alliance. These automatically generated gene summaries make cross-species gene function comparisons tenable and increase discoverability of potential models of human disease. In addition to being displayed on Alliance gene pages, these summaries are also included on several MOK gene pages.",False,True,,0.7199086,alliance,,16.85172766,ok,,of genome resources,,v2,0.85172766,,True,False,False,,http://www.alliancegenome.org,http://www.alliancegenome.org,True,,1,False,False,False

22907343,Use of IMGT(®) databases and tools for antibody engineering and humanization.,"IMGT(®), the international ImMunoGeneTics information system(®) (http://www.imgt.org), was created in 1989 to manage the huge diversity of the antigen receptors, immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, and T cell receptors (TR). Standardized sequence and structure analysis of antibody using IMGT(®) databases and tools allows one to bridge, for the first time, the gap between antibody sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures. This is achieved through the IMGT Scientific chart rules, based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts of classification (IMGT gene and allele nomenclature), description (IMGT standardized labels), and numerotation (IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles). IMGT(®) is the international reference for immunogenetics and immunoinformatics and its standards are particularly useful for antibody humanization and evaluation of immunogenicity. IMGT(®) databases for antibody nucleotide sequences and genes include IMGT/LIGM-DB and IMGT/GENE-DB, respectively, whereas nucleotide sequence analysis is performed by the IMGT/V-QUEST, IMGT/HighV-QUEST, and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis tools. In this chapter, we focus on IMGT(®) databases and tools for amino acid sequences, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures: the IMGT/DomainGapAlign and IMGT/Collier-de-Perles tools, the IMGT/2Dstructure-DB database for amino acid sequences of monoclonal antibodies (mAb, suffix -mab) and fusion proteins for immune applications (FPIA, suffix -cept) of the World Health Organization/International Nonproprietary Name (WHO/INN) programme and other proteins of interest, and the IMGT/3Dstructure-DB database for crystallized antibodies and its associated tools (IMGT/StructuralQuery, IMGT/DomainSuperimpose).",False,True,,0.70877934,,imgt(®,16.8417438,ok,,,fpia | imgt,v2,0.8417438,,True,False,False,,http://www.imgt.org,http://www.imgt.org,True,"...ternational ImMunoGeneTics information system(®) (http://www.imgt.org), was created in 1989 to manage the huge diversit...",1,False,False,False
30419069,C/VDdb: A multi-omics expression profiling database for a knowledge-driven approach in cardiovascular disease (CVD).,"The cardiovascular disease (C/VD) database is an integrated and clustered information resource that covers multi-omic studies (microRNA, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics) of cardiovascular-related traits with special emphasis on coronary artery disease (CAD). This resource was built by mining existing literature and public databases and thereafter manual biocuration was performed. To enable integration of omic data from distinct platforms and species, a specific ontology was applied to tie together and harmonise multi-level omic studies based on gene and protein clusters (CluSO) and mapping of orthologous genes (OMAP) across species. CAD continues to be a leading cause of death in the population worldwide, and it is generally thought to be an age-related disease. However, CAD incidence rates are now known to be highly influenced by environmental factors and interactions, in addition to genetic determinants. With the complexity of CAD aetiology, there is a difficulty in research studies to elucidate general elements compared to other cardiovascular diseases. Data from 92 studies, covering 13945 molecular entries (4353 unique molecules) is described, including data descriptors for experimental setup, study design, discovery-validation sample size and associated fold-changes of the differentially expressed molecular features (p-value<0.05). A dedicated interactive web interface, equipped with a multi-parametric search engine, data export and indexing menus are provided for a user-accessible browsing experience. The main aim of this work was the development of a data repository linking clinical information and molecular differential expression in several CVD-related traits from multi-omics studies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).

They are responsible for a particular function that contributes to protein's overall role. Because of this essential role, the majority of the genetic variants occur in the domains. In this study, the somatic mutations across 21 cancer types were mapped to the individual protein domains. To map the mutations to the domains, we employed the whole human proteome to predict the domains in each protein sequence and recognized about 149 668 domains. A novel Perl-API program was developed to convert the protein domain positions into genomic positions, and users can freely access them through GitHub. We determined the distribution of protein domains across 23 chromosomes with the help of these genomic positions. Interestingly, chromosome 19 has more number of protein domains in comparison with other chromosomes. Then, we mapped the cancer mutations to all the protein domains. Around 46-65% of mutations were mapped to their corresponding protein domains, and significantly mutated domains for all the cancer types were determined using the local false discovery ratio (locfdr).

We also established 454 mouse lines from trap ES clones and deposited them in the mouse embryo bank at the Center for Animal Resources and Development, Kumamoto University, Japan. The EGTC database is the most extensive academic resource for gene-trap mouse lines. Because we used a promoter-trap strategy, all trapped genes were expressed in ES cells. To understand the general characteristics of the trapped genes in the EGTC library, we used Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for pathway analysis and found that the EGTC ES clones covered a broad range of pathways. We also used Gene Ontology (GO) classification data provided by Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) to compare the functional distribution of genes in each GO term between trapped genes in the EGTC mouse lines and total genes annotated in MGI.

In this study, we report recent updates to BRM for miRNA data analysis and cross-species comparisons across datasets.<h4>Results</h4>BRM v2.3 has the capability to query predicted miRNA targets from multiple databases, retrieve potential regulatory miRNAs for known genes, integrate experimentally derived miRNA and mRNA datasets, perform ortholog mapping across species, and retrieve annotation and cross-reference identifiers for an expanded number of species. Here we use BRM to show that developmental exposure of zebrafish to 30 uM nicotine from 6-48 hours post fertilization (hpf) results in behavioral hyperactivity in larval zebrafish and alteration of putative miRNA gene targets in whole embryos at developmental stages that encompass early neurogenesis. We show typical workflows for using BRM to integrate experimental zebrafish miRNA and mRNA microarray datasets with example retrievals for zebrafish, including pathway annotation and mapping to human ortholog. Functional analysis of differentially regulated (p<0.05) gene targets in BRM indicates that nicotine exposure disrupts genes involved in neurogenesis, possibly through misregulation of nicotine-sensitive miRNAs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BRM provides the ability to mine complex data for identification of candidate miRNAs or pathways that drive phenotypic outcome and, therefore, is a useful hypothesis generation tool for systems biology. The miRNA workflow in BRM allows for efficient processing of multiple miRNA and mRNA datasets in a single software environment with the added capability to interact with public data sources and visual analytic tools for HTP data analysis at a systems level.

26691201,An ultra-high-density map as a community resource for discerning the genetic basis of quantitative traits in maize.,"<h4>Background</h4>To safeguard the food supply for the growing human population, it is important to understand and exploit the genetic basis of quantitative traits. Next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. Hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we generated a linkage map containing 1,151,856 high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73, which were verified in the maize intermated B73 × Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population. This resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database  (iPlant, http://data.maizecode.org/maize/qtl/syn10/ ). Moreover, in this population combined with the IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations. Eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a 2.21-4.96 Mb interval. Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high-quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data were deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE), which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community.

Moreover, the recognized depth of genomic variation in indigenous African populations, reflecting the ancient origins of humanity on the African continent, and the effect of selection pressures on the genome, will be valuable in understanding the range of both pathological and nonpathological variations. The involvement of these populations in accurately documenting the extant genetic heterogeneity is more than essential.

32081792,PredictSuperFam-PSS-3D1D: A server for predicting superfamily for the annotation of twilight zone protein sequences.,"Annotation of twilight zone protein sequences has been hitherto attempted by predicting the fold of the given sequence. We report here the PredictSuperFam-PSS-3D1D method, which predicts the superfamily for a given twilight zone (TZ) protein sequence. Earlier, we have reported that adding predicted secondary structure information into the threading methods could improve fold prediction especially for the TZ protein sequences. In this study, we have analysed the application of the same method to predict superfamilies. Here, in this method, the twilight zone protein sequence is threaded with the 3D1D profiles of the known protein superfamilies library. In addition, weightage for the predicted secondary structure (PSS) is also employed. The performance of the method is benchmarked with twilight zone sequences. In the benchmarks, 62 and 65 percentages of superfamily predictions are obtained with GOR IV and NPS@ predicted secondary structures, respectively. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that the method is sensitive in predicting the superfamilies. A case study has been conducted with the hypothetical protein sequences of Schistosoma haematobium (Blood Fluke) using this method and the results are analyzed.

The metal ion zinc is critically involved in universal biological processes, ranging from protein-DNA complexes and transcription regulation to enzymatic catalysis and metabolic pathways. Proteins have evolved a series of motifs to specifically recognize and bind zinc ions. Many of these, so called zinc fingers, are structurally independent globular domains with discontinuous binding motifs made up of residues mostly far apart in sequence. Through a systematic approach starting from the BRIX structure fragment database, we discovered that there exists another predictable subset of zinc-binding motifs that not only have a conserved continuous sequence pattern but also share a characteristic local conformation, despite being included in totally different overall folds. While this does not allow general prediction of all Zn binding motifs, a HMM-based web server, Huf-Zinc, is available for prediction of these novel, as well as conventional, zinc finger motifs in protein sequences.

23514033,The Enzyme Portal: a case study in applying user-centred design methods in bioinformatics.,"User-centred design (UCD) is a type of user interface design in which the needs and desires of users are taken into account at each stage of the design process for a service or product; often for software applications and websites. Its goal is to facilitate the design of software that is both useful and easy to use. To achieve this, you must characterise users' requirements, design suitable interactions to meet their needs, and test your designs using prototypes and real life scenarios.For bioinformatics, there is little practical information available regarding how to carry out UCD in practice. To address this we describe a complete, multi-stage UCD process used for creating a new bioinformatics resource for integrating enzyme information, called the Enzyme Portal (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enzymeportal).

Our hope is that this case study will motivate the reader to apply similar UCD approaches to their own software design for bioinformatics.

These contributions were made thanks to the exploration of natural habitats, museum collections, historic libraries, private holdings and phylogenetic investigations by many professional and amateur lepidopterists throughout the world. Zootaxa was introduced as a novel publication model with its innovative, community-based, and democratic approach to speed up the process of taxonomic publications. The fast-developing technology and especially the accessibility of digital taxonomic tools prepared the basis for novel links and inter-relationships. The global digital revolution and especially the overwhelming embrace of digital technology in Africa made an essential switch in the way we work: it became possible to present taxonomic information in a way that is searchable, consultable, illustrative, updatable, correctable and, most importantly-open and accessible to everyone.

24909981,Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies: an open-access resource for instrument benchmarking and exploratory research.,"Manual processing of sleep recordings is extremely time-consuming. Efforts to automate this process have shown promising results, but automatic systems are generally evaluated on private databases, not allowing accurate cross-validation with other systems. In lacking a common benchmark, the relative performances of different systems are not compared easily and advances are compromised. To address this fundamental methodological impediment to sleep study, we propose an open-access database of polysomnographic biosignals. To build this database, whole-night recordings from 200 participants [97 males (aged 42.9 ± 19.8 years) and 103 females (aged 38.3 ± 18.9 years); age range: 18-76 years] were pooled from eight different research protocols performed in three different hospital-based sleep laboratories. All recordings feature a sampling frequency of 256 Hz and an electroencephalography (EEG) montage of 4-20 channels plus standard electro-oculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG) and respiratory signals. Access to the database can be obtained through the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) website (http://www.ceams-carsm.ca/en/MASS), and requires only affiliation with a research institution and prior approval by the applicant's local ethical review board. Providing the research community with access to this free and open sleep database is expected to facilitate the development and cross-validation of sleep analysis automation systems.

The GH19 domain-containing sequences (22,461) were divided into a chitinase and an endolysin subfamily by analyzing sequence networks, guided by taxonomy and the substrate specificity of characterized enzymes. The chitinase subfamily was split into seventeen groups, thus extending the previous classification. The endolysin subfamily is more diverse and consists of thirty-four groups. Despite their sequence diversity, twenty-six residues are conserved in chitinases and endolysins, which can be distinguished by two specific sequence patterns at six and four positions, respectively. Their location outside the catalytic cleft suggests a possible mechanism for substrate specificity that goes beyond the direct interaction with the substrate. The evolution of the GH19 catalytic domain was investigated by large-scale phylogeny. The inferred evolutionary history and putative horizontal gene transfer events differ from previous works. While no clear patterns were detected in endolysins, chitinases varied in sequence length by up to four loop insertions, causing at least eight distinct presence/absence loop combinations.

The concept of regulation of a given mRNA by alternate mRNA (competing endogenous mRNA) by virtue of interactions with miRNAs through shared miRNA response elements is poised to become a fundamental genetic regulatory mechanism. The molecular basis of the mRNA-mRNA cross talks is via miRNA response elements, which can be predicted based on both molecular interaction and evolutionary conservation. By examining the co-occurrence of miRNA response elements in the mRNAs on a genome-wide basis we predict competing endogenous RNA for specific mRNAs targeted by miRNAs.

33181822,"Color Data v2: a user-friendly, open-access database with hereditary cancer and hereditary cardiovascular conditions datasets.","Publicly available genetic databases promote data sharing and fuel scientific discoveries for the prevention, treatment and management of disease. In 2018, we built Color Data, a user-friendly, open access database containing genotypic and self-reported phenotypic information from 50 000 individuals who were sequenced for 30 genes associated with hereditary cancer. In a continued effort to promote access to these types of data, we launched Color Data v2, an updated version of the Color Data database. This new release includes additional clinical genetic testing results from more than 18 000 individuals who were sequenced for 30 genes associated with hereditary cardiovascular conditions as well as polygenic risk scores for breast cancer, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. In addition, we used self-reported phenotypic information to implement the following four clinical risk models: Gail Model for 5-year risk of breast cancer, Claus Model for lifetime risk of breast cancer, simple office-based Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score for 10-year risk of coronary heart disease and CHARGE-AF simple score for 5-year risk of atrial fibrillation. These new features and capabilities are highlighted through two sample queries in the database. We hope that the broad dissemination of these data will help researchers continue to explore genotype-phenotype correlations and identify novel variants for functional analysis, enabling scientific discoveries in the field of population genomics.

25068035,"The Software Ontology (SWO): a resource for reproducibility in biomedical data analysis, curation and digital preservation.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Biomedical ontologists to date have concentrated on ontological descriptions of biomedical entities such as gene products and their attributes, phenotypes and so on. Recently, effort has diversified to descriptions of the laboratory investigations by which these entities were produced. However, much biological insight is gained from the analysis of the data produced from these investigations, and there is a lack of adequate descriptions of the wide range of software that are central to bioinformatics. We need to describe how data are analyzed for discovery, audit trails, provenance and reproducibility.<h4>Results</h4>The Software Ontology (SWO) is a description of software used to store, manage and analyze data. Input to the SWO has come from beyond the life sciences, but its main focus is the life sciences. We used agile techniques to gather input for the SWO and keep engagement with our users. The result is an ontology that meets the needs of a broad range of users by describing software, its information processing tasks, data inputs and outputs, data formats versions and so on. Recently, the SWO has incorporated EDAM, a vocabulary for describing data and related concepts in bioinformatics. The SWO is currently being used to describe software used in multiple biomedical applications.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SWO is another element of the biomedical ontology landscape that is necessary for the description of biomedical entities and how they were discovered. An ontology of software used to analyze data produced by investigations in the life sciences can be made in such a way that it covers the important features requested and prioritized by its users. The SWO thus fits into the landscape of biomedical ontologies and is produced using techniques designed to keep it in line with user's needs.<h4>Availability</h4>The Software Ontology is available under an Apache 2.0 license at http://theswo.sourceforge.net/; the Software Ontology blog can be read at http://softwareontology.wordpress.com.",False,True,,0.7108261,,swo,16.56794846,ok,,,s,v2,0.56794846,Software Ontology,True,False,False,,http://softwareontology.wordpress.com,http://softwareontology.wordpress.com,True,...e.net/; the Software Ontology blog can be read at http://softwareontology.wordpress.com.,1,False,False,False

The morphological shift between mycelial/yeast phases is crucial for its virulence, but the transcriptional networks implicated in dimorphic transition are still not fully understood. Here, we report the global transcriptomic differences occurring between mould and yeast phases of <i>S. schenckii</i>, including changes in gene expression profiles associated with these distinct cellular phenotypes. Moreover, we also propose a new genome annotation, which reveals a more complex transcriptional architecture than previously assumed. Using RNA-seq, we identified a total of 17 307 genes, of which 11 217 were classified as protein-encoding genes, whereas 6090 were designated as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Approximately ~71 % of all annotated genes were found to overlap and the different-strand overlapping type was the most common. Gene expression analysis revealed that 8795 genes were differentially regulated among yeast and mould forms. Differential gene expression was also observed for antisense ncRNAs overlapping neighbouring protein-encoding genes. The release of transcriptome-wide data and the establishment of the Sporothrix Genome DataBase (http://sporothrixgenomedatabase.unime.it) represent an important milestone for <i>Sporothrix</i> research, because they provide a strong basis for future studies on the molecular pathways involved in numerous biological processes.",False,True,,0.6444263,sporothrix genome,,16.566728949999998,ok,,,,v2,0.56672895,,True,False,False,,http://sporothrixgenomedatabase.unime.it,http://sporothrixgenomedatabase.unime.it,True,...establishment of the Sporothrix Genome DataBase (http://sporothrixgenomedatabase.unime.it) represent an important milestone for <i>Sporothr...,1,False,False,False
30357587,The Japan Monkey Centre Primates Brain Imaging Repository for comparative neuroscience: an archive of digital records including records for endangered species.,"Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational analysis technology have enabled comparisons among various primate brains in a three-dimensional electronic format. Results from comparative studies provide information about common features across primates and species-specific features of neuroanatomy. Investigation of various species of non-human primates is important for understanding such features, but the majority of comparative MRI studies have been based on experimental primates, such as common marmoset, macaques, and chimpanzee. A major obstacle has been the lack of a database that includes non-experimental primates' brain MRIs. To facilitate scientific discoveries in the field of comparative neuroanatomy and brain evolution, we launched a collaborative project to develop an open-resource repository of non-human primate brain images obtained using ex vivo MRI. As an initial open resource, here we release a collection of structural MRI and diffusion tensor images obtained from 12 species: pygmy marmoset, owl monkey, white-fronted capuchin, crab-eating macaque, Japanese macaque, bonnet macaque, toque macaque, Sykes' monkey, red-tailed monkey, Schmidt's guenon, de Brazza's guenon, and lar gibbon. Sixteen postmortem brain samples from the 12 species, stored in the Japan Monkey Centre (JMC), were scanned using a 9.4-T MRI scanner and made available through the JMC collaborative research program ( http://www.j-monkey.jp/BIR/index_e.html ). The expected significant contributions of the JMC Primates Brain Imaging Repository include (1) resources for comparative neuroscience research, (2) preservation of various primate brains, including those of endangered species, in a permanent digital form, (3) resources with higher resolution for identifying neuroanatomical features, compared to previous MRI atlases, (4) resources for optimizing methods of scanning large fixed brains, and (5) references for veterinary neuroradiology.

25145231,Pest select database: a new tool to use selective pesticides for IPM.,"Crop pests can be naturally controlled by a set of beneficial arthropods, as entomophagous predators or parasites, leading to a global reduction of pest occurrence and insecticide use. The selectivity of plant protection products for these beneficial arthropods is a key factor in the success of IPM strategies. An abundant scientific literature concerning this subject exists, but for the final pesticide users, the information is not always easily accessible or understood. The IOBC working group ""Pesticides and Beneficial Organisms"" (PBO) has developed a new database to compile all data concerning pesticide selectivity on beneficial arthropods, obtained with methods that followed the IOBC test standard characteristics. These standards have been developed since the 70's by the Working group Pesticide and Beneficial Organisms, in the context of IPM. This database includes a first set of data previously published, coming from the different Joint Pesticide Testing Programs, with the addition of results published later in the IOBC Bulletin. The second set of data has been extracted from the Public verse of the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), established by the different EU member' states in the context of the registration process at the European Level and available online on the EFSA website. As nearly all active ingredients have to be tested on at least 2 to 4 selected beneficial arthropod species with methods that followed the IOBC standard characteristics, these DAR represent an important source of information for pesticide users dealing with beneficial arthropods and selectivity, with about 50% of the actual records. This source was previously only exploited for registration purposes and not accessible to a large public, but a lot of results, mainly from the first tier testing, have been compiled and interpreted for IPM. The new database is available online on the area restricted to the IOBC-members (http:// www.iobc-wprs.org/restricted_member/toolbox.cfm).

Microarray data for 4,367 samples from National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus was collected, and analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis algorithm. Fifty one gene coexpression modules that are related to cell types, tissues, development stages, and other experimental conditions were identified. The high dimensional gene expression was reduced to tens of modules that were associated with experiments/traits, representing signatures for phenotypes. Six modules were enriched with genomic regions of clustered genes. Hub genes could also be screened by intramodule connectivity. By analyzing higher order module networks, we found that cell signaling modules are more connected than other modules.

A web server (http://wgmlst.imst.nsysu.edu.tw) was set up with the database and the tools, allowing users to upload WGS data to generate whole genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) profiles and to perform cluster analysis of wgMLST profiles. The usefulness of the database in disease cluster identification was demonstrated by analyzing a panel of genomes from 55 epidemiologically well-defined <i>S.</i> Enteritidis isolates provided by the Minnesota Department of Health.

31290545,A curated collection of transcriptome datasets to investigate the molecular mechanisms of immunoglobulin E-mediated atopic diseases.,"Prevalence of allergies has reached ~20% of population in developed countries and sensitization rate to one or more allergens among school age children are approaching 50%. However, the combination of the complexity of atopic allergy susceptibility/development and environmental factors has made identification of gene biomarkers challenging. The amount of publicly accessible transcriptomic data presents an unprecedented opportunity for mechanistic discoveries and validation of complex disease signatures across studies. However, this necessitates structured methodologies and visual tools for the interpretation of results. Here, we present a curated collection of transcriptomic datasets relevant to immunoglobin E-mediated atopic diseases (ranging from allergies to primary immunodeficiencies). Thirty-three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus, encompassing 1860 transcriptome profiles, were made available on the Gene Expression Browser (GXB), an online and open-source web application that allows for the query, visualization and annotation of metadata.

27749924,Matching the Diversity of Sulfated Biomolecules: Creation of a Classification Database for Sulfatases Reflecting Their Substrate Specificity.,"Sulfatases cleave sulfate groups from various molecules and constitute a biologically and industrially important group of enzymes. However, the number of sulfatases whose substrate has been characterized is limited in comparison to the huge diversity of sulfated compounds, yielding functional annotations of sulfatases particularly prone to flaws and misinterpretations. In the context of the explosion of genomic data, a classification system allowing a better prediction of substrate specificity and for setting the limit of functional annotations is urgently needed for sulfatases. Here, after an overview on the diversity of sulfated compounds and on the known sulfatases, we propose a classification database, SulfAtlas (http://abims.sb-roscoff.fr/sulfatlas/), based on sequence homology and composed of four families of sulfatases. The formylglycine-dependent sulfatases, which constitute the largest family, are also divided by phylogenetic approach into 73 subfamilies, each subfamily corresponding to either a known specificity or to an uncharacterized substrate. SulfAtlas summarizes information about the different families of sulfatases. Within a family a web page displays the list of its subfamilies (when they exist) and the list of EC numbers.

Many ADEs are not identified in trials until the drug is approved for clinical use, which results in adverse morbidity and mortality. To date, millions of ADEs have been reported around the world. Methods to avoid or reduce ADEs are an important issue for drug discovery and development. Here, we reported a comprehensive database of adverse drug events (namely MetaADEDB), which included more than 520,000 drug-ADE associations among 3059 unique compounds (including 1330 drugs) and 13,200 ADE items by data integration and text mining. All compounds and ADEs were annotated with the most commonly used concepts defined in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Meanwhile, a computational method, namely the phenotypic network inference model (PNIM), was developed for prediction of potential ADEs based on the database. The area under the receive operating characteristic curve (AUC) is more than 0.9 by 10-fold cross validation, while the AUC value was 0.912 for an external validation set extracted from the US-FDA Adverse Events Reporting System, which indicated that the prediction capability of the method was reliable.

28293068,A web-based microsatellite database for the Magnaporthe oryzae genome.,"Microsatellites have been widely utilized for molecular marker development. Codominant and multiallelic nature of these simple repeats have several advantages over other types of molecular markers. Their broad applicability in the area of molecular biology like gene mapping, genome characterization, genome evolution, and gene regulation has been reported in various crop plants, animals and fungi. Considering these benefits of the SSR markers, a MMDB (Magnaporthe oryzae Microsatellite Database) was developed to help in understanding about the pathogen and its diversity at strains level of a particular geographic region, which can help us to make a proper utilization of blast resistance genes in the region. This microsatellite database is based on whole genome sequence of two M. oryzae isolates, RML-29 (2665 SSRs from 43037792 bp) and RP-2421 (3169 SSRs from 45510614 bp). Although, first M. oryzae genome (70-15) was sequenced in 2005, but this sequenced isolate is not a true field isolate of M. oryzae.

Identifying similarity between protein structures could not only yield valuable clues to their function, but can also be employed for motif finding, protein docking and off-target identification. The current study has undertaken analysis of structures of all MTB gene products with available structures was analyzed. Majority of the MTB proteins belonged to the α/β class. 23 different protein folds are used in the MTB protein structures. Of these, the TIM barrel fold was found to be highly conserved even at very low sequence identity. We identified 21 paralogs and 27 analogs of MTB based on domains and EC classification. Our analysis revealed that many of the current drug targets share structural similarity with other proteins within the MTB genome, which could probably be off-targets.

This is a particularly important consideration in the era of high-throughput sequencing, when the discovery of novel transcripts far outpaces our knowledge of their functions. To gain a comprehensive picture of biology requires a structural framework for making functional inferences on RNA. To this end we have developed the RNA Structurome Database ( https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu ), a comprehensive repository of RNA secondary structural information that spans the entire human genome. Here, we compile folding information for every base pair of the genome that may be transcribed: coding, noncoding, and intergenic regions, as well as repetitive elements, telomeres, etc. This was done by fragmenting the GRCh38 reference genome into 154,414,320 overlapping sequence fragments and, for each fragment, calculating a set of metrics based on the sequence's folding properties.

Little is known concerning sRNAs and their influence on the regulatory machinery in the genus <i>Corynebacterium</i>, despite its medical, veterinary and biotechnological importance. Here, we expand corynebacterial regulatory knowledge by integrating sRNAs and their regulatory interactions into the transcriptional regulatory networks of six corynebacterial species, covering four human and animal pathogens, and integrate this data into the CoryneRegNet database. To this end, we predicted sRNAs to regulate 754 genes, including 206 transcription factors, in corynebacterial gene regulatory networks.

Multi-omics and therapeutic data are of great interest to develop early remedial interventions. This work provides a therapeutic data platform (Mammarenavirus (MMV)-db) for pathogenic mammarenaviruses with potential catastrophic effects on human health around the world. The database integrates vaccinomics and RNA-based therapeutics data for seven human pathogenic MMVs associated with severe viral hemorrhagic fever and lethality in humans. Protein-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, helper T-cell and interferon-inducing epitopes were mapped using a cluster of immune-omics-based algorithms and tools for the seven human pathogenic viral species. Furthermore, the physiochemical and antigenic properties were also explored to guide protein-specific multi-epitope subunit vaccine for each species. Moreover, highly efficacious RNAs (small Interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA)) after extensive genome-based analysis with therapeutic relevance were explored.

22079417,Disease associated cytokine SNPs database: an annotation and dissemination model.,"Cytokines mediate crucial functions in innate and adaptive immunity. They play valuable roles in immune cell growth and lineage specification, and are associated with various disease pathologies. A large number of low, medium and high throughput studies have implicated association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes with diseases. A preponderance of such experiments has not shown any causality of an identified SNP to the associated disease. Instead, they have identified statistically significant SNP-disease associations; it is likely that some of these cytokine gene variants may directly or indirectly cause the disease phenotype(s). To fill this knowledge gap and derive study parameters for cytokine SNP-disease causality relationships, we have designed and developed the disease associated cytokine SNP database (DACS-DB). DACS-DB has data on 456 cytokine genes, approximately 63,000 SNPs, and 853 SNP-associated diseases. In DACS-DB, among other attributes, we present functional annotation, and heterozygosity allele frequency for the SNPs, and literature-validated SNP association for diseases. Users of the DB can run queries such as the ones to find disease-associated SNPs in a cytokine gene, and all the SNPs involved in a disease. We have developed a web front end (available at http://www.iupui.edu/~cytosnp) to disseminate this information for immunologists, biomedical researchers, and other interested biological researchers. Since there is no such comprehensive collection of disease associated cytokine SNPs, this DB will be vital to understand the role of cytokine SNPs as markers in disease, and more importantly, in causality to disease thus helping to identify drug targets for common inflammatory diseases.",False,True,,0.7087238,disease associated cytokine snps database,,11.90228134,ok,,disease associated cytokine snp database,dacs-db,v2,0.90228134,Disease associated cytokine SNPs database,True,True,True,,http://www.iupui.edu/~cytosnp,http://www.iupui.edu/~cytosnp,True,....

24564786,Fungal plant cell wall-degrading enzyme database: a platform for comparative and evolutionary genomics in fungi and Oomycetes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) play significant roles throughout the fungal life including acquisition of nutrients and decomposition of plant cell walls. In addition, many of PCWDEs are also utilized by biofuel and pulp industries. In order to develop a comparative genomics platform focused in fungal PCWDEs and provide a resource for evolutionary studies, Fungal PCWDE Database (FPDB) is constructed (http://pcwde.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/).<h4>Results</h4>In order to archive fungal PCWDEs, 22 sequence profiles were constructed and searched on 328 genomes of fungi, Oomycetes, plants and animals. A total of 6,682 putative genes encoding PCWDEs were predicted, showing differential distribution by their life styles, host ranges and taxonomy. Genes known to be involved in fungal pathogenicity, including polygalacturonase (PG) and pectin lyase, were enriched in plant pathogens. Furthermore, crop pathogens had more PCWDEs than those of rot fungi, implying that the PCWDEs analysed in this study are more needed for invading plant hosts than wood-decaying processes. Evolutionary analysis of PGs in 34 selected genomes revealed that gene duplication and loss events were mainly driven by taxonomic divergence and partly contributed by those events in species-level, especially in plant pathogens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The FPDB would provide a fungi-specialized genomics platform, a resource for evolutionary studies of PCWDE gene families and extended analysis option by implementing Favorite, which is a data exchange and analysis hub built in Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP 2.0; http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/).",False,True,,0.69451994,fungal plant cell wall-degrading enzyme database,,11.8559676,ok,cfgp | comparative fungal genomics platform,fungal pcwde database | comparative fungal genomics platform,cfgp | fpdb,v2,0.8559676,Fungal plant cell wall-degrading enzyme database,True,True,True,,http://pcwde.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/ | http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr/,http://pcwde.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/,True,"...ies, Fungal PCWDE Database (FPDB) is constructed (http://pcwde.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/).<h4>Results</h4>In order to archive fungal PCWDE...",1,True,False,True
21364759,NAViGaTing the micronome--using multiple microRNA prediction databases to identify signalling pathway-associated microRNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>MicroRNAs are a class of small RNAs known to regulate gene expression at the transcript level, the protein level, or both. Since microRNA binding is sequence-based but possibly structure-specific, work in this area has resulted in multiple databases storing predicted microRNA:target relationships computed using diverse algorithms. We integrate prediction databases, compare predictions to in vitro data, and use cross-database predictions to model the microRNA:transcript interactome--referred to as the micronome--to study microRNA involvement in well-known signalling pathways as well as associations with disease. We make this data freely available with a flexible user interface as our microRNA Data Integration Portal--mirDIP (http://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP).<h4>Results</h4>mirDIP integrates prediction databases to elucidate accurate microRNA:target relationships. Using NAViGaTOR to produce interaction networks implicating microRNAs in literature-based, KEGG-based and Reactome-based pathways, we find these signalling pathway networks have significantly more microRNA involvement compared to chance (p<0.05), suggesting microRNAs co-target many genes in a given pathway. Further examination of the micronome shows two distinct classes of microRNAs; universe microRNAs, which are involved in many signalling pathways; and intra-pathway microRNAs, which target multiple genes within one signalling pathway. We find universe microRNAs to have more targets (p<0.0001), to be more studied (p<0.0002), and to have higher degree in the KEGG cancer pathway (p<0.0001), compared to intra-pathway microRNAs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our pathway-based analysis of mirDIP data suggests microRNAs are involved in intra-pathway signalling. We identify two distinct classes of microRNAs, suggesting a hierarchical organization of microRNAs co-targeting genes both within and between pathways, and implying differential involvement of universe and intra-pathway microRNAs at the disease level.",False,True,,0.66331553,navigating,,11.83892226,ok,,reactome | microrna data integration portal | navigator,mirdip | kegg | irdip,v2,0.83892226,,True,False,False,,http://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP,http://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP,True,...as our microRNA Data Integration Portal--mirDIP (http://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP).<h4>Results</h4>mirDIP integrates prediction dat...,1,False,False,False

Significant advances in cell and tissue culture, more specifically, advances in the transfection and transduction of human and mammalian cells, has directly led to giant leaps forward in fields such as cancer research, genetics, and public health. At the same time, a corresponding increase has been seen in available cell culture related literature. Often times, due to the sheer number and degree of variability of available literature, it is a challenge to find specific, yet practical cell culture related information.To respond to this rising tide of information, a practical, user-friendly database containing cell-lines, plasmids, vectors, selection agents, concentrations and media was created. The database currently consists of over 3,900 cell lines (Human and Mammalian) and 1,900 plasmids/vectors collected from 2,700 pieces of published literature.

33002137,A content-based dataset recommendation system for researchers-a case study on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository.,"It is a growing trend among researchers to make their data publicly available for experimental reproducibility and data reusability. Sharing data with fellow researchers helps in increasing the visibility of the work. On the other hand, there are researchers who are inhibited by the lack of data resources. To overcome this challenge, many repositories and knowledge bases have been established to date to ease data sharing. Further, in the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the number of datasets added to these dataset repositories. However, most of these repositories are domain-specific, and none of them can recommend datasets to researchers/users. Naturally, it is challenging for a researcher to keep track of all the relevant repositories for potential use. Thus, a dataset recommender system that recommends datasets to a researcher based on previous publications can enhance their productivity and expedite further research. This work adopts an information retrieval (IR) paradigm for dataset recommendation. We hypothesize that two fundamental differences exist between dataset recommendation and PubMed-style biomedical IR beyond the corpus. First, instead of keywords, the query is the researcher, embodied by his or her publications. Second, to filter the relevant datasets from non-relevant ones, researchers are better represented by a set of interests, as opposed to the entire body of their research. This second approach is implemented using a non-parametric clustering technique. These clusters are used to recommend datasets for each researcher using the cosine similarity between the vector representations of publication clusters and datasets. The maximum normalized discounted cumulative gain at 10 (NDCG@10), precision at 10 (p@10) partial and p@10 strict of 0.89, 0.78 and 0.61, respectively, were obtained using the proposed method after manual evaluation by five researchers. As per the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind on content-based dataset recommendation. We hope that this system will further promote data sharing, offset the researchers' workload in identifying the right dataset and increase the reusability of biomedical datasets.

Because aberrant or inappropriate DD superfamily-mediated signaling events are associated with various human diseases, such as cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and immunological disorders, the studies in these fields are of great biological and clinical importance. To facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the DD superfamily is associated with biological and disease processes, we have developed the DD database (http://www.deathdomain.org), a manually curated database that aims to offer comprehensive information on protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of the DD superfamily. The DD database was created by manually curating 295 peer-reviewed studies that were published in the literature; the current version documents 175 PPI pairs among the 99 DD superfamily proteins. The DD database provides a detailed summary of the DD superfamily proteins and their PPI data.

A critical challenge in inferring QS information from crystallographic data is distinguishing biological interfaces from fortuitous crystal-packing contacts. Here, we tackled this problem by developing strategies for aligning and comparing QS states across both homologs and data repositories. QS conservation across homologs proved remarkably strong at predicting biological relevance and is implemented in two methods, QSalign and anti-QSalign, for annotating homo-oligomers and monomers, respectively. QS conservation across repositories is implemented in QSbio (http://www.QSbio.org), which approaches the accuracy of manual curation and allowed us to predict >100,000 QS states across the Protein Data Bank.

24556904,In silico identification of transcription factors in Medicago sativa using available transcriptomic resources.,"Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that govern organismal development and response to the environment by regulating gene expression. Information on the amount and diversity of TFs within individual plant species is critical for understanding of their biological roles and evolutionary history across the plant kingdom. Currently, only scattered information on separate TFs is available for alfalfa, the most extensively cultivated forage legume in the world. In the meantime, several large transcriptomic resources that can be used to identify and characterize alfalfa TF genes are freely accessible online. In this study, we have performed an in silico analysis of transcriptome data generated in our laboratory and publicly acquirable from other sources to reveal and systematize alfalfa transcription factors.

However, most seemingly ""open data"" do not provide legal permissions for reuse and redistribution. The inability to integrate and redistribute our collective data resources blocks innovation and stymies the creation of life-improving diagnostic and drug selection tools. To help the biomedical research and research support communities (e.g. libraries, funders, repositories, etc.) understand and navigate the data licensing landscape, the (Re)usable Data Project (RDP) (http://reusabledata.org) assesses the licensing characteristics of data resources and how licensing behaviors impact reuse. We have created a ruleset to determine the reusability of data resources and have applied it to 56 scientific data resources (e.g. databases) to date. The results show significant reuse and interoperability barriers.

These studies have led to the generation of numerous seri-related databases which are extremely helpful for the scientific community. In this article, we have reviewed all the available online resources on silkworm and its related organisms, including databases as well as informative websites. We have studied their basic features and impact on research through citation count analysis, finally discussing the role of emerging sequencing and analysis technologies in the field of seri-data science.

21876203,A tool for biomarker discovery in the urinary proteome: a manually curated human and animal urine protein biomarker database.,"Urine is an important source of biomarkers. A single proteomics assay can identify hundreds of differentially expressed proteins between disease and control samples; however, the ability to select biomarker candidates with the most promise for further validation study remains difficult. A bioinformatics tool that allows accurate and convenient comparison of all of the existing related studies can markedly aid the development of this area. In this study, we constructed the Urinary Protein Biomarker (UPB) database to collect existing studies of urinary protein biomarkers from published literature. To ensure the quality of data collection, all literature was manually curated. The website (http://122.70.220.102/biomarker) allows users to browse the database by disease categories and search by protein IDs in bulk. Researchers can easily determine whether a biomarker candidate has already been identified by another group for the same disease or for other diseases, which allows for the confidence and disease specificity of their biomarker candidate to be evaluated. Additionally, the pathophysiological processes of the diseases can be studied using our database with the hypothesis that diseases that share biomarkers may have the same pathophysiological processes. Because of the natural relationship between urinary proteins and the urinary system, this database may be especially suitable for studying the pathogenesis of urological diseases. Currently, the database contains 553 and 275 records compiled from 174 and 31 publications of human and animal studies, respectively. We found that biomarkers identified by different proteomic methods had a poor overlap with each other.

26077899,Integrated web visualizations for protein-protein interaction databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Understanding living systems is crucial for curing diseases. To achieve this task we have to understand biological networks based on protein-protein interactions. Bioinformatics has come up with a great amount of databases and tools that support analysts in exploring protein-protein interactions on an integrated level for knowledge discovery. They provide predictions and correlations, indicate possibilities for future experimental research and fill the gaps to complete the picture of biochemical processes. There are numerous and huge databases of protein-protein interactions used to gain insights into answering some of the many questions of systems biology. Many computational resources integrate interaction data with additional information on molecular background. However, the vast number of diverse Bioinformatics resources poses an obstacle to the goal of understanding. We present a survey of databases that enable the visual analysis of protein networks.<h4>Results</h4>We selected M=10 out of N=53 resources supporting visualization, and we tested against the following set of criteria: interoperability, data integration, quantity of possible interactions, data visualization quality and data coverage. The study reveals differences in usability, visualization features and quality as well as the quantity of interactions. StringDB is the recommended first choice. CPDB presents a comprehensive dataset and IntAct lets the user change the network layout. A comprehensive comparison table is available via web. The supplementary table can be accessed on http://tinyurl.com/PPI-DB-Comparison-2015.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Only some web resources featuring graph visualization can be successfully applied to interactive visual analysis of protein-protein interaction.

MicroRNAs can bind to both coding and noncoding RNAs and regulate their stability and expression. Genetic variants and somatic mutations may alter microRNA sequences and their target sites and therefore impact microRNA-target recognition. Aberrant microRNA-target interactions have been associated with many diseases. In recent years, computational resources have been developed for retrieving, annotating, and analyzing the impact of mutations on microRNA-target recognition. In this chapter, we provide an overview on the computational analysis of mutations impacting microRNA target recognition, followed by a detailed tutorial on how to use three major Web-based bioinformatics resources: PolymiRTS ( http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miRSNP ), a database of genetic variants impacting microRNA target recognition; SomamiR ( http://compbio.uthsc.edu/SomamiR ), a database of somatic mutations affecting the interactions between microRNAs and their targets in mRNAs and noncoding RNAs; and miR2GO ( http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miR2GO ), a computational tool for knowledge-based functional analysis of genetic variants and somatic mutations in microRNA seed regions.",False,True,,0.7177019,polymirts,,10.8977765,ok,,somamir,mir2go,spacy+v2,0.8977765,Functional Analysis of Genetic Variants and Somatic Mutations Impacting MicroRNA-Target Recognition,True,False,False,PolymiRTS,http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miRSNP | http://compbio.uthsc.edu/SomamiR | http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miR2GO,http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miRSNP,True,"...r Web-based bioinformatics resources: PolymiRTS ( http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miRSNP ), a database of genetic variants impacting micro...",1,False,True,True

27261064,A Collection of Conserved Noncoding Sequences to Study Gene Regulation in Flowering Plants.,"Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding cis-regulatory elements, of which the identification remains an ongoing challenge owing to the prevalence of large numbers of nonfunctional TF binding sites. Powerful comparative genomics methods, such as phylogenetic footprinting, can be used for the detection of conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs), which are functionally constrained and can greatly help in reducing the number of false-positive elements. In this study, we applied a phylogenetic footprinting approach for the identification of CNSs in 10 dicot plants, yielding 1,032,291 CNSs associated with 243,187 genes. To annotate CNSs with TF binding sites, we made use of binding site information for 642 TFs originating from 35 TF families in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In three species, the identified CNSs were evaluated using TF chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data, resulting in significant overlap for the majority of data sets. To identify ultraconserved CNSs, we included genomes of additional plant families and identified 715 binding sites for 501 genes conserved in dicots, monocots, mosses, and green algae. Additionally, we found that genes that are part of conserved mini-regulons have a higher coherence in their expression profile than other divergent gene pairs. All identified CNSs were integrated in the PLAZA 3.0 Dicots comparative genomics platform (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v3_dicots/) together with new functionalities facilitating the exploration of conserved cis-regulatory elements and their associated genes.

33789960,"A Bioinformatics Whole-Genome Sequencing Workflow for Clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Isolate Analysis, Validated Using a Reference Collection Extensively Characterized with Conventional Methods and <i>In Silico</i> Approaches.","The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for routine typing of bacterial isolates has increased substantially in recent years. For <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB), in particular, WGS has the benefit of drastically reducing the time required to generate results compared to most conventional phenotypic methods. Consequently, a multitude of solutions for analyzing WGS MTB data have been developed, but their successful integration in clinical and national reference laboratories is hindered by the requirement for their validation, for which a consensus framework is still largely absent. We developed a bioinformatics workflow for (Illumina) WGS-based routine typing of MTB complex (MTBC) member isolates allowing complete characterization, including (sub)species confirmation and identification (16S, <i>csb</i>/RD, <i>hsp65</i>), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prediction, and pathogen typing (spoligotyping, SNP barcoding, and core genome multilocus sequence typing). Workflow performance was validated on a per-assay basis using a collection of 238 in-house-sequenced MTBC isolates, extensively characterized with conventional molecular biology-based approaches supplemented with public data. For SNP-based AMR prediction, results from molecular genotyping methods were supplemented with <i>in silico</i> modified data sets, allowing us to greatly increase the set of evaluated mutations. The workflow demonstrated very high performance with performance metrics of >99% for all assays, except for spoligotyping, where sensitivity dropped to ∼90%. The validation framework for our WGS-based bioinformatics workflow can aid in the standardization of bioinformatics tools by the MTB community and other SNP-based applications regardless of the targeted pathogen(s).

26743197,Database of synesthetic color associations for Japanese kanji.,"Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which certain types of stimuli elicit involuntary perceptions in an unrelated pathway. A common type of synesthesia is grapheme-color synesthesia, in which the visual perception of letters and numbers stimulates the perception of a specific color. Previous studies have often collected relatively small numbers of grapheme-color associations per synesthete, but the accumulation of a large quantity of data has greater promise for uncovering the mechanisms underlying synesthetic association. In this study, we therefore collected large samples of data from a total of eight synesthetes. All told, we obtained over 1000 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese kanji characters from each of two synesthetes, over 100 synesthetic colors form each of three synesthetes, and about 80 synesthetic colors associated with Japanese hiragana, Latin letters, and Arabic numerals from each of three synesthetes. We then compiled the data into a database, called the KANJI-Synesthetic Colors Database (K-SCD), which has a total of 5122 colors for 483, 46, and 46 Japanese kanji, hiragana, and katakana characters, respectively, as well as for 26 Latin letters and ten Arabic numerals. In addition to introducing the K-SCD, this article demonstrates the database's merits by using two examples, in which two new rules for synesthetic association, ""shape similarity"" and ""synesthetic color clustering,"" were found. The K-SCD is publicly accessible ( www.cv.jinkan.kyoto-u.ac.jp/site/uploads/K-SCD.xlsm ) and will be a valuable resource for those who wish to conduct statistical analyses using a rich dataset in order to uncover the rules governing synesthetic association and to understand its mechanisms.",False,True,,0.6920775,,k-scd,8.99258626,ok,,kanji-synesthetic colors database,,v2,0.99258626,,True,False,False,,http://www.cv.jinkan.kyoto-u.ac.jp/site/uploads/K-SCD.xlsm,http://www.cv.jinkan.kyoto-u.ac.jp/site/uploads/K-SCD.xlsm,True,,1,False,False,False

30241075,Next generation database search algorithm for forensic mitogenome analyses.,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation is being reported relative to the corrected version of the first sequenced human mitochondrial genome. A review of the existing literature across disciplines that employ mtDNA demonstrates that insertions and deletions are not reported in a standardized way. This may lead to false exclusions of identical sequences, unidentified matches in missing persons mtDNA databases, biased mtDNA database frequency estimates and overestimation of the genetic evidence. Seven years ago we introduced alignment-free database search software (SAM) and implemented it into the mtDNA database EMPOP (https://empop.online) to produce reliable and conservative frequency estimates that are required in the forensic context. However, ambiguity remained in how laboratories have been reporting mitotypes, as often more than one single alignment of a given mtDNA sequence was feasible. In order to overcome this limitation we here describe a concept and provide software for producing stable, harmonized phylogenetic alignment of mtDNA sequences for database searches. The new software SAM 2 will be made available via EMPOP and provide the user with the already established conservative frequency estimates. In addition, SAM 2 offers the rCRS-coded haplotype of a given mtDNA sequence following the established and widely accepted phylogenetic alignment. This provides the user with feedback on how mitotypes are stored in EMPOP and how they should be reported in order to harmonize nomenclature.

33064489,The Functionally Unannotated Proteome of Human Male Tissues: A Shared Resource to Uncover New Protein Functions Associated with Reproductive Biology.,"In the context of the Human Proteome Project, we built an inventory of 412 functionally unannotated human proteins for which experimental evidence at the protein level exists (uPE1) and which are highly expressed in tissues involved in human male reproduction. We implemented a strategy combining literature mining, bioinformatics tools to collate annotation and experimental information from specific molecular public resources, and efficient visualization tools to put these unknown proteins into their biological context (protein complexes, tissue and subcellular location, expression pattern). The gathered knowledge allowed pinpointing five uPE1 for which a function has recently been proposed and which should be updated in protein knowledge bases. Furthermore, this bioinformatics strategy allowed to build new functional hypotheses for five other uPE1s in link with phenotypic traits that are specific to male reproductive function such as ciliogenesis/flagellum formation in germ cells (CCDC112 and TEX9), chromatin remodeling (C3orf62) and spermatozoon maturation (CCDC183). We also discussed the enigmatic case of MAGEB proteins, a poorly documented cancer/testis antigen subtype. Tools used and computational outputs produced during this study are freely accessible via ProteoRE (http://www.proteore.org), a Galaxy-based instance, for reuse purposes.

32601103,A New Data Repository for Pharmacokinetic Natural Product-Drug Interactions: From Chemical Characterization to Clinical Studies.,"There are many gaps in scientific knowledge about the clinical significance of pharmacokinetic natural product-drug interactions (NPDIs) in which the natural product (NP) is the precipitant and a conventional drug is the object. The National Center for Complimentary and Integrative Health created the Center of Excellence for NPDI Research (NaPDI Center) (www.napdi.org) to provide leadership and guidance on the study of pharmacokinetic NPDIs. A key contribution of the Center is the first user-friendly online repository that stores and links pharmacokinetic NPDI data across chemical characterization, metabolomics analyses, and pharmacokinetic in vitro and clinical experiments (repo.napdi.org). The design is expected to help researchers more easily arrive at a complete understanding of pharmacokinetic NPDI research on a particular NP. The repository will also facilitate multidisciplinary collaborations, as the repository links all of the experimental data for a given NP across the study types. The current work describes the design of the repository, standard operating procedures used to enter data, and pharmacokinetic NPDI data that have been entered to date. To illustrate the usefulness of the NaPDI Center repository, more details on two high-priority NPs, cannabis and kratom, are provided as case studies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The data and knowledge resulting from natural product-drug interaction (NPDI) studies is distributed across a variety of information sources, rendering difficulties to find, access, and reuse.

28291243,A standard database for drug repositioning.,"Drug repositioning, the process of discovering, validating, and marketing previously approved drugs for new indications, is of growing interest to academia and industry due to reduced time and costs associated with repositioned drugs. Computational methods for repositioning are appealing because they putatively nominate the most promising candidate drugs for a given indication. Comparing the wide array of computational repositioning methods, however, is a challenge due to inconsistencies in method validation in the field. Furthermore, a common simplifying assumption, that all novel predictions are false, is intellectually unsatisfying and hinders reproducibility. We address this assumption by providing a gold standard database, repoDB, that consists of both true positives (approved drugs), and true negatives (failed drugs).

However, the G-quadruplex DNA polymorphism poses problems for interpreting ligand screening assays. In order to establish standardized MS-based screening assays, we studied 28 sequences with documented NMR structures in (usually ∼100 mM) potassium, and report here their circular dichroism (CD), melting temperature (Tm), NMR spectra and electrospray mass spectra in 1 mM KCl/100 mM trimethylammonium acetate. Based on these results, we make a short-list of sequences that adopt the same structure in the MS assay as reported by NMR, and provide recommendations on using them for MS-based assays. We also built an R-based open-source application to build and consult a database, wherein further sequences can be incorporated in the future. The application handles automatically most of the data processing, and allows generating custom figures and reports.

26038555,Using homology relations within a database markedly boosts protein sequence similarity search.,"Inference of homology from protein sequences provides an essential tool for analyzing protein structure, function, and evolution. Current sequence-based homology search methods are still unable to detect many similarities evident from protein spatial structures. In computer science a search engine can be improved by considering networks of known relationships within the search database. Here, we apply this idea to protein-sequence-based homology search and show that it dramatically enhances the search accuracy. Our new method, COMPADRE (COmparison of Multiple Protein sequence Alignments using Database RElationships) assesses the relationship between the query sequence and a hit in the database by considering the similarity between the query and hit's known homologs. This approach increases detection quality, boosting the precision rate from 18% to 83% at half-coverage of all database homologs. The increased precision rate allows detection of a large fraction of protein structural relationships, thus providing structure and function predictions for previously uncharacterized proteins. Our results suggest that this general approach is applicable to a wide variety of methods for detection of biological similarities.

21682852,Querying large read collections in main memory: a versatile data structure.,"<h4>Background</h4>High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is now heavily exploited for genome (re-) sequencing, metagenomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics and requires different, but computer intensive bioinformatic analyses. When a reference genome is available, mapping reads on it is the first step of this analysis. Read mapping programs owe their efficiency to the use of involved genome indexing data structures, like the Burrows-Wheeler transform. Recent solutions index both the genome, and the k-mers of the reads using hash-tables to further increase efficiency and accuracy. In various contexts (e.g. assembly or transcriptome analysis), read processing requires to determine the sub-collection of reads that are related to a given sequence, which is done by searching for some k-mers in the reads. Currently, many developments have focused on genome indexing structures for read mapping, but the question of read indexing remains broadly unexplored. However, the increase in sequence throughput urges for new algorithmic solutions to query large read collections efficiently.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a solution, named Gk arrays, to index large collections of reads, an algorithm to build the structure, and procedures to query it. Once constructed, the index structure is kept in main memory and is repeatedly accessed to answer queries like ""given a k-mer, get the reads containing this k-mer (once/at least once)"". We compared our structure to other solutions that adapt uncompressed indexing structures designed for long texts and show that it processes queries fast, while requiring much less memory. Our structure can thus handle larger read collections. We provide examples where such queries are adapted to different types of read analysis (SNP detection, assembly, RNA-Seq).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gk arrays constitute a versatile data structure that enables fast and more accurate read analysis in various contexts. The Gk arrays provide a flexible brick to design innovative programs that mine efficiently genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, or transcriptomics reads.

Recently, we sequenced, assembled, annotated, and performed a preliminary analysis on the 150-megabase genome of the ctenophore, Mnemiopsis. This sequencing effort has produced the first set of whole-genome sequencing data on any ctenophore species and is amongst the first wave of projects to sequence an animal genome de novo solely using next-generation sequencing technologies.<h4>Description</h4>The Mnemiopsis Genome Project Portal (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/mnemiopsis/) is intended both as a resource for obtaining genomic information on Mnemiopsis through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface and as a model for developing customized Web portals that enable access to genomic data. The scope of data available through this Portal goes well beyond the sequence data available through GenBank, providing key biological information not available elsewhere, such as pathway and protein domain analyses; it also features a customized genome browser for data visualization.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We expect that the availability of these data will allow investigators to advance their own research projects aimed at understanding phylogenetic diversity and the evolution of proteins that play a fundamental role in metazoan development.

22741533,Huntington's disease and its therapeutic target genes: a global functional profile based on the HD Research Crossroads database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region in the huntingtin gene. Although the disease is triggered by the mutation of a single gene, intensive research has linked numerous other genes to its pathogenesis. To obtain a systematic overview of these genes, which may serve as therapeutic targets, CHDI Foundation has recently established the HD Research Crossroads database. With currently over 800 cataloged genes, this web-based resource constitutes the most extensive curation of genes relevant to HD. It provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to survey molecular mechanisms involved in HD in a holistic manner.<h4>Methods</h4>To gain a synoptic view of therapeutic targets for HD, we have carried out a variety of bioinformatical and statistical analyses to scrutinize the functional association of genes curated in the HD Research Crossroads database. In particular, enrichment analyses were performed with respect to Gene Ontology categories, KEGG signaling pathways, and Pfam protein families. For selected processes, we also analyzed differential expression, using published microarray data. Additionally, we generated a candidate set of novel genetic modifiers of HD by combining information from the HD Research Crossroads database with previous genome-wide linkage studies.<h4>Results</h4>Our analyses led to a comprehensive identification of molecular mechanisms associated with HD. Remarkably, we not only recovered processes and pathways, which have frequently been linked to HD (such as cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and calcium signaling), but also found strong indications for other potentially disease-relevant mechanisms that have been less intensively studied in the context of HD (such as the cell cycle and RNA splicing, as well as Wnt and ErbB signaling). For follow-up studies, we provide a regularly updated compendium of molecular mechanism, that are associated with HD, at http://hdtt.sysbiolab.eu Additionally, we derived a candidate set of 24 novel genetic modifiers, including histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1), CDK5 regulatory subunit 2 (CDK5R2), and coactivator 1ß of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARGC1B).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of our study give us an intriguing picture of the molecular complexity of HD.

30639529,Catalysing the way towards antimicrobial effectiveness: A systematic analysis and a new online resource for antimicrobial-enzyme combinations against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.,"Growing antimicrobial resistance and the resilience of biofilm infections have led researchers to study the potential of antimicrobial combinations, including those incorporating enzymes with biofilm-disrupting abilities. This work aimed to evaluate the journey of antimicrobial-enzyme combination research and to gain insights into its current status and most promising leads. Expert curators annotated and analysed all published experimental data on enzyme-containing combinations for two major biofilm-forming pathogens, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. This entailed the construction of the first publicly accessible online database on antimicrobial-enzyme combinations, the Antimicrobial Enzyme Combinations Database (https://www.ceb.uminho.pt/aecd). Gathered data were also reconstructed as knowledge networks to help analyse and visualise annotated entities (e.g. enzymes, methods, strains, combination outputs). The database currently holds 122 and 206 annotated combinations for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively, and their analysis allowed a systematic review of the available evidence on enzyme combinations, reliably illustrating the studies being performed. The most tested enzymes (e.g. lysozyme, DNase, lysostaphin) were scrutinised and the rationale behind each combination was explained. This research area is still growing although current research gaps/opportunities were identified, such as lack of biofilm testing and studies on polymicrobial scenarios.

22384314,The Awesome Power of Yeast Evolutionary Genetics: New Genome Sequences and Strain Resources for the Saccharomyces sensu stricto Genus.,"High-quality, well-annotated genome sequences and standardized laboratory strains fuel experimental and evolutionary research. We present improved genome sequences of three species of Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts: S. bayanus var. uvarum (CBS 7001), S. kudriavzevii (IFO 1802(T) and ZP 591), and S. mikatae (IFO 1815(T)), and describe their comparison to the genomes of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. The new sequences, derived by assembling millions of short DNA sequence reads together with previously published Sanger shotgun reads, have vastly greater long-range continuity and far fewer gaps than the previously available genome sequences. New gene predictions defined a set of 5261 protein-coding orthologs across the five most commonly studied Saccharomyces yeasts, enabling a re-examination of the tempo and mode of yeast gene evolution and improved inferences of species-specific gains and losses. To facilitate experimental investigations, we generated genetically marked, stable haploid strains for all three of these Saccharomyces species. These nearly complete genome sequences and the collection of genetically marked strains provide a valuable toolset for comparative studies of gene function, metabolism, and evolution, and render Saccharomyces sensu stricto the most experimentally tractable model genus.

27103629,Integrated sequence and immunology filovirus database at Los Alamos.,"The Ebola outbreak of 2013-15 infected more than 28 000 people and claimed more lives than all previous filovirus outbreaks combined. Governmental agencies, clinical teams, and the world scientific community pulled together in a multifaceted response ranging from prevention and disease control, to evaluating vaccines and therapeutics in human trials. As this epidemic is finally coming to a close, refocusing on long-term prevention strategies becomes paramount. Given the very real threat of future filovirus outbreaks, and the inherent uncertainty of the next outbreak virus and geographic location, it is prudent to consider the extent and implications of known natural diversity in advancing vaccines and therapeutic approaches. To facilitate such consideration, we have updated and enhanced the content of the filovirus portion of Los Alamos Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses Database.

Despite considerable progress, the correct identification of phosphorylated sites, their quantification, and their interpretation regarding physiological relevance remain challenging. The MS Resource Pillar of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) Human Proteome Project (HPP) initiated the Phosphopeptide Challenge as a resource to help the community evaluate methods, learn procedures and data analysis routines, and establish their own workflows by comparing results obtained from a standard set of 94 phosphopeptides (serine, threonine, tyrosine) and their nonphosphorylated counterparts mixed at different ratios in a neat sample and a yeast background. Participants analyzed both samples with their method(s) of choice to report the identification and site localization of these peptides, determine their relative abundances, and enrich for the phosphorylated peptides in the yeast background. We discuss the results from 22 laboratories that used a range of different methods, instruments, and analysis software. We reanalyzed submitted data with a single software pipeline and highlight the successes and challenges in correct phosphosite localization. All of the data from this collaborative endeavor are shared as a resource to encourage the development of even better methods and tools for diverse phosphoproteomic applications.

24320595,Automated workflow-based exploitation of pathway databases provides new insights into genetic associations of metabolite profiles.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associate with clinical phenotypes, but these SNPs usually explain just a small part of the heritability and have relatively modest effect sizes. In contrast, SNPs that associate with metabolite levels generally explain a higher percentage of the genetic variation and demonstrate larger effect sizes. Still, the discovery of SNPs associated with metabolite levels is challenging since testing all metabolites measured in typical metabolomics studies with all SNPs comes with a severe multiple testing penalty. We have developed an automated workflow approach that utilizes prior knowledge of biochemical pathways present in databases like KEGG and BioCyc to generate a smaller SNP set relevant to the metabolite. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in the analysis of GWAS of metabolomic phenotypes and provides novel insights into the genetic basis of metabolic variation through the re-analysis of published GWAS datasets.<h4>Results</h4>Re-analysis of the published GWAS dataset from Illig et al. (Nature Genetics, 2010) using a pathway-based workflow (http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/319.html), confirmed previously identified hits and identified a new locus of human metabolic individuality, associating Aldehyde dehydrogenase family1 L1 (ALDH1L1) with serine/glycine ratios in blood. Replication in an independent GWAS dataset of phospholipids (Demirkan et al., PLoS Genetics, 2012) identified two novel loci supported by additional literature evidence: GPAM (Glycerol-3 phosphate acyltransferase) and CBS (Cystathionine beta-synthase). In addition, the workflow approach provided novel insight into the affected pathways and relevance of some of these gene-metabolite pairs in disease development and progression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrate the utility of automated exploitation of background knowledge present in pathway databases for the analysis of GWAS datasets of metabolomic phenotypes.

26582915,piRNA cluster database: a web resource for piRNA producing loci.,"Piwi proteins and their guiding small RNAs, termed Piwi-interacting (pi-) RNAs, are essential for silencing of transposons in the germline of animals. A substantial fraction of piRNAs originates from genomic loci termed piRNA clusters and sequences encoded in these piRNA clusters determine putative targets for the Piwi/piRNA system. In the past decade, studies of piRNA transcriptomes in different species revealed additional roles for piRNAs beyond transposon silencing, reflecting the astonishing plasticity of the Piwi/piRNA system along different phylogenetic branches. Moreover, piRNA transcriptomes can change drastically during development and vary across different tissues.Since piRNA clusters crucially shape piRNA profiles, analysis of these loci is imperative for a thorough understanding of functional and evolutionary aspects of the piRNA pathway. But despite the ever-growing amount of available piRNA sequence data, we know little about the factors that determine differential regulation of piRNA clusters, nor the evolutionary events that cause their gain or loss.In order to facilitate addressing these subjects, we established a user-friendly piRNA cluster database (http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html) that provides comprehensive data on piRNA clusters in multiple species, tissues and developmental stages based on small RNA sequence data deposited at NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA).",False,True,,0.7130328,sequence read archive,sra,6.0,conflict,sra | sequence read archive,,,spacy,0.0,piRNA cluster database,True,False,False,,http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html,http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html,True,...tablished a user-friendly piRNA cluster database (http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html) that provides comprehensive data on piRNA cluste...,1,False,False,False
23176546,Development of a gene expression database and related analysis programs for evaluation of anticancer compounds.,"Genome-wide transcriptional expression analysis is a powerful strategy for characterizing the biological activity of anticancer compounds. It is often instructive to identify gene sets involved in the activity of a given drug compound for comparison with different compounds. Currently, however, there is no comprehensive gene expression database and related application system that is; (i) specialized in anticancer agents; (ii) easy to use; and (iii) open to the public. To develop a public gene expression database of antitumor agents, we first examined gene expression profiles in human cancer cells after exposure to 35 compounds including 25 clinically used anticancer agents. Gene signatures were extracted that were classified as upregulated or downregulated after exposure to the drug. Hierarchical clustering showed that drugs with similar mechanisms of action, such as genotoxic drugs, were clustered. Connectivity map analysis further revealed that our gene signature data reflected modes of action of the respective agents. Together with the database, we developed analysis programs that calculate scores for ranking changes in gene expression and for searching statistically significant pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database in order to analyze the datasets more easily. Our database and the analysis programs are available online at our website (http://scads.jfcr.or.jp/db/cs/). Using these systems, we successfully showed that proteasome inhibitors are selectively classified as endoplasmic reticulum stress inducers and induce atypical endoplasmic reticulum stress.

25407602,A mammalian transcription factor-specific peptide repository for targeted proteomics.,"Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) play an essential role in mammalian development and function as they are vital for the majority of cellular processes. Despite their biological importance, TF proteomic data is scarce in the literature, likely due to difficulties in detecting peptides as the abundance of TFs in cells tends to be low. In recent years, significant improvements in MS-based technologies in terms of sensitivity and specificity have increased the interest in developing quantitative methodologies specifically targeting relatively lowly abundant proteins such as TFs in mammalian models. Such efforts would be greatly aided by the availability of TF peptide-specific information as such data would not only enable improvements in speed and accuracy of protein identifications, but also ameliorate cross-comparisons of quantitative proteomics data and allow for a more efficient development of targeted proteomics assays. However, to date, no comprehensive TF proteotypic peptide database has been developed. To address this evident lack of TF peptide data in public repositories, we are generating a comprehensive, experimentally derived TF proteotypic peptide spectral library dataset based on in vitro protein expression. Our library currently contains peptide information for 89 TFs and this number is set to increase in the near future.

21559461,A bioinformatics classifier and database for heme-copper oxygen reductases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Heme-copper oxygen reductases (HCOs) are the last enzymatic complexes of most aerobic respiratory chains, reducing dioxygen to water and translocating up to four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane (eukaryotes) or cytoplasmatic membrane (prokaryotes). The number of completely sequenced genomes is expanding exponentially, and concomitantly, the number and taxonomic distribution of HCO sequences. These enzymes were initially classified into three different types being this classification recently challenged.<h4>Methodology</h4>We reanalyzed the classification scheme and developed a new bioinformatics classifier for the HCO and Nitric oxide reductases (NOR), which we benchmark against a manually derived gold standard sequence set. It is able to classify any given sequence of subunit I from HCO and NOR with a global recall and precision both of 99.8%. We use this tool to classify this protein family in 552 completely sequenced genomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We concluded that the new and broader data set supports three functional and evolutionary groups of HCOs. Homology between NORs and HCOs is shown and NORs closest relationship with C Type HCOs demonstrated.

30541929,A Statistical Procedure for Genome-Wide Detection of QTL Hotspots Using Public Databases with Application to Rice.,"Genome-wide detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) hotspots underlying variation in many molecular and phenotypic traits has been a key step in various biological studies since the QTL hotspots are highly informative and can be linked to the genes for the quantitative traits. Several statistical methods have been proposed to detect QTL hotspots. These hotspot detection methods rely heavily on permutation tests performed on summarized QTL data or individual-level data (with genotypes and phenotypes) from the genetical genomics experiments. In this article, we propose a statistical procedure for QTL hotspot detection by using the summarized QTL (interval) data collected in public web-accessible databases. First, a simple statistical method based on the uniform distribution is derived to convert the QTL interval data into the expected QTL frequency (EQF) matrix. And then, to account for the correlation structure among traits, the QTL for correlated traits are grouped together into the same categories to form a reduced EQF matrix. Furthermore, a permutation algorithm on the EQF elements or on the QTL intervals is developed to compute a sliding scale of EQF thresholds, ranging from strict to liberal, for assessing the significance of QTL hotspots. With grouping, much stricter thresholds can be obtained to avoid the detection of spurious hotspots. Real example analysis and simulation study are carried out to illustrate our procedure, evaluate the performances and compare with other methods. It shows that our procedure can control the genome-wide error rates at the target levels, provide appropriate thresholds for correlated data and is comparable to the methods using individual-level data in hotspot detection. Depending on the thresholds used, more than 100 hotspots are detected in GRAMENE rice database. We also perform a genome-wide comparative analysis of the detected hotspots and the known genes collected in the Rice Q-TARO database. The comparative analysis reveals that the hotspots and genes are conformable in the sense that they co-localize closely and are functionally related to relevant traits. Our statistical procedure can provide a framework for exploring the networks among QTL hotspots, genes and quantitative traits in biological studies.

Here we compare transcript catalogs for Hsa21q, chimpanzee chromosome 21 (Ptr21q), and orthologous regions of mouse chromosomes 16, 17, and 10 for open reading frame (ORF) characteristics and conservation. The Hsa21q and mouse catalogs contain 552 and 444 gene models, respectively, of which only 162 are highly conserved. Hsa21q transcripts were used to identify orthologous exons in Ptr21q and assemble 533 putative transcripts. Transcript catalogs for all three organisms are searchable for nucleotide and amino acid sequence features of ORF length, repeat content, experimental support, gene structure, and conservation. For human and mouse comparisons, three additional summaries are provided: (1) the chromosomal distribution of novel ORF transcripts versus potential functional RNAs, (2) the distribution of species-specific transcripts within Hsa21q and mouse models of Down syndrome, and (3) the organization of sense-antisense and putative sense-antisense structures defining potential regulatory mechanisms.

25922515,The Fossil Calibration Database-A New Resource for Divergence Dating.,"Fossils provide the principal basis for temporal calibrations, which are critical to the accuracy of divergence dating analyses. Translating fossil data into minimum and maximum bounds for calibrations is the most important-often least appreciated-step of divergence dating. Properly justified calibrations require the synthesis of phylogenetic, paleontological, and geological evidence and can be difficult for nonspecialists to formulate. The dynamic nature of the fossil record (e.g., new discoveries, taxonomic revisions, updates of global or local stratigraphy) requires that calibration data be updated continually lest they become obsolete. Here, we announce the Fossil Calibration Database (http://fossilcalibrations.org), a new open-access resource providing vetted fossil calibrations to the scientific community. Calibrations accessioned into this database are based on individual fossil specimens and follow best practices for phylogenetic justification and geochronological constraint.

The lack of standardization, and the variation regarding bioinformatics workflows and parameters, however, complicates interoperability among (inter)national laboratories. We present a validation strategy applied to a bioinformatics workflow for Illumina data that performs complete characterization of Shiga toxin-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (STEC) isolates including antimicrobial resistance prediction, virulence gene detection, serotype prediction, plasmid replicon detection and sequence typing. The workflow supports three commonly used bioinformatics approaches for the detection of genes and alleles: alignment with blast+, kmer-based read mapping with KMA, and direct read mapping with SRST2. A collection of 131 STEC isolates collected from food and human sources, extensively characterized with conventional molecular methods, was used as a validation dataset. Using a validation strategy specifically adopted to WGS, we demonstrated high performance with repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity above 95 % for the majority of all assays.

Very few integrated databases offer quality flags on the level of the individual record, making it hard for users to easily extract the data that are fit for their specific purposes. This article describes the different steps that were developed to analyse the quality and completeness of the distribution records within the European and international Ocean Biogeographic Information Systems (EurOBIS and OBIS). Records are checked on data format, completeness and validity of information, quality and detail of the used taxonomy and geographic indications and whether or not the record is a putative outlier. The corresponding quality control (QC) flags will not only help users with their data selection, they will also help the data management team and the data custodians to identify possible gaps and errors in the submitted data, providing scope to improve data quality. The results of these quality control procedures are as of now available on both the EurOBIS and OBIS databases. Through the Biology portal of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet Biology), a subset of EurOBIS records--passing a specific combination of these QC steps--is offered to the users.

34349739,Beyond Taxonomic Identification: Integration of Ecological Responses to a Soil Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene Database.,"High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes. However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalizing syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterize taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth CS) to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from survey metadata. Specifically, we modeled taxon responses to soil pH at the OTU level using hierarchical logistic regression (HOF) models, to provide information on both the shape of landscape scale pH-abundance responses, and pH optima (pH at which OTU abundance is maximal). We identify that most of the soil OTUs examined exhibited a non-flat relationship with soil pH. Further, the pH optima could not be generalized by broad taxonomy, highlighting the need for tools and databases synthesizing ecological traits at finer taxonomic resolution. We further demonstrate the utility of the database by testing against geographically dispersed query 16S datasets; evaluating efficacy by quantifying matches, and accuracy in predicting pH responses of query sequences from a separate large soil survey. We found that the CS database provided good coverage of dominant taxa; and that the taxa indicating soil pH in a query dataset corresponded with the pH classifications of top matches in the CS database. Furthermore we were able to predict query dataset community structure, using predicted abundances of dominant taxa based on query soil pH data and the HOF models of matched CS database taxa. The database with associated HOF model outputs is released as an online portal for querying single sequences of interest (https://shiny-apps.ceh.ac.uk/ID-TaxER/), and flat files are made available for use in bioinformatic pipelines.

It remains a leading system for functional genomic work and has been the focus of many pioneering efforts, including the systematic construction and analysis of gene deletion mutants. Over the past decade, many large-scale studies have made use of the deletion and other mutant collections to assay genetic interactions, chemical sensitivities, and other phenotypes, contributing enormously to our understanding of gene function. The deletion mutant collection has also been used in cell biological surveys to identify genes that control cell and organelle morphology. One valuable approach for systematic definition of gene function and biological pathways involves global assessment of the localization patterns of the proteins they encode and how these patterns are altered in response to environmental or genetic perturbation. However, proteome-wide, cell biological screens are extremely challenging, from both a technical and computational perspective.

Published online as the Kyoto Human Embryo Visualization Project (http://atlas.cac.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp) and also as the Human Embryo Atlas (http://tiny.cc/Human_Embryo_Atlas). Published now electronically as a digital eBook (http://tiny.cc/Kyoto_Collection_eBook). This new digital format allows incorporation of whole embryo and histology manipulable images, labels, and a linked glossary. New imaging modalities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and episcopic fluorescence image capture (EFIC) can also be easily displayed as animations. For research, the collection specimens and histological sections have been extensively studied and published in several hundred papers, discussed here and elsewhere in this special edition. I will also describe how the Kyoto collection will now form a major partner of a new international embryology research group, the Digital Embryology Consortium (https://human-embryology.org). The digital Kyoto collection will be made available for remote researcher access, analysis, and comparison with other collections allowing new research and educational applications.

26234511,Bio-AIMS Collection of Chemoinformatics Web Tools based on Molecular Graph Information and Artificial Intelligence Models.,"The molecular information encoding into molecular descriptors is the first step into in silico Chemoinformatics methods in Drug Design. The Machine Learning methods are a complex solution to find prediction models for specific biological properties of molecules. These models connect the molecular structure information such as atom connectivity (molecular graphs) or physical-chemical properties of an atom/group of atoms to the molecular activity (Quantitative Structure - Activity Relationship, QSAR). Due to the complexity of the proteins, the prediction of their activity is a complicated task and the interpretation of the models is more difficult. The current review presents a series of 11 prediction models for proteins, implemented as free Web tools on an Artificial Intelligence Model Server in Biosciences, Bio-AIMS (http://bio-aims.udc.es/TargetPred.php). Six tools predict protein activity, two models evaluate drug - protein target interactions and the other three calculate protein - protein interactions. The input information is based on the protein 3D structure for nine models, 1D peptide amino acid sequence for three tools and drug SMILES formulas for two servers. The molecular graph descriptor-based Machine Learning models could be useful tools for in silico screening of new peptides/proteins as future drug targets for specific treatments.",False,True,,0.7217696,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://bio-aims.udc.es/TargetPred.php,http://bio-aims.udc.es/TargetPred.php,True,"...telligence Model Server in Biosciences, Bio-AIMS (http://bio-aims.udc.es/TargetPred.php).

22106335,Data-driven information retrieval in heterogeneous collections of transcriptomics data links SIM2s to malignant pleural mesothelioma.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-wide measurement of transcript levels is an ubiquitous tool in biomedical research. As experimental data continues to be deposited in public databases, it is becoming important to develop search engines that enable the retrieval of relevant studies given a query study. While retrieval systems based on meta-data already exist, data-driven approaches that retrieve studies based on similarities in the expression data itself have a greater potential of uncovering novel biological insights.<h4>Results</h4>We propose an information retrieval method based on differential expression. Our method deals with arbitrary experimental designs and performs competitively with alternative approaches, while making the search results interpretable in terms of differential expression patterns. We show that our model yields meaningful connections between biological conditions from different studies. Finally, we validate a previously unknown connection between malignant pleural mesothelioma and SIM2s suggested by our method, via real-time polymerase chain reaction in an independent set of mesothelioma samples.<h4>Availability</h4>Supplementary data and source code are available from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/research/rex.",False,True,,0.7076822,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/research/rex,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/research/rex,True,...lementary data and source code are available from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/research/rex.,1,False,False,False

Potential hybridization sites, having a user-defined minimum number of bases that are paired with the oligonucleotide probe, are first identified. Then free energy values are evaluated for each potential hybridization site, and if it has a calculated free energy of equal or higher negative value than a user-defined free energy cut-off value, it is considered as a site of high probability of hybridization. The Universal Fingerprinting Chip Applications Server contains the software for visualizing predicted hybridization patterns, which yields a simulated hybridization fingerprint that can be compared with experimentally derived fingerprints or with a virtual fingerprint arising from a different sample.<h4>Availability</h4>The database is available for free at http://bioinformatica.homelinux.org/UFCVH/",False,True,,0.68636954,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://bioinformatica.homelinux.org/UFCVH/,http://bioinformatica.homelinux.org/UFCVH/,True,...ability</h4>The database is available for free at http://bioinformatica.homelinux.org/UFCVH/,1,False,False,False
34724898,Genomic resources of broomcorn millet: demonstration and application of a high-throughput BAC mapping pipeline.,"<h4>Background</h4>With high-efficient water-use and drought tolerance, broomcorn millet has emerged as a candidate for food security. To promote its research process for molecular breeding and functional research, a comprehensive genome resource is of great importance.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, we constructed a BAC library for broomcorn millet, generated BAC end sequences based on the clone-array pooled shotgun sequencing strategy and Illumina sequencing technology, and integrated BAC clones into genome by a novel pipeline for BAC end profiling. The BAC library consisted of 76,023 clones with an average insert length of 123.48 Kb, covering about 9.9-fold of the 850 Mb genome. Of 9216 clones tested using our pipeline, 8262 clones were mapped on the broomcorn millet cultivar longmi4 genome. These mapped clones covered 308 of the 829 gaps left by the genome. To our knowledge, this is the only BAC resource for broomcorn millet.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We constructed a high-quality BAC libraray for broomcorn millet and designed a novel pipeline for BAC end profiling. BAC clones can be browsed and obtained from our website ( http://eightstarsbio.com/gresource/JBrowse-1.16.5/index.html ).

23879659,Reannotation and extended community resources for the genome of the non-seed plant Physcomitrella patens provide insights into the evolution of plant gene structures and functions.,"<h4>Background</h4>The moss Physcomitrella patens as a model species provides an important reference for early-diverging lineages of plants and the release of the genome in 2008 opened the doors to genome-wide studies. The usability of a reference genome greatly depends on the quality of the annotation and the availability of centralized community resources. Therefore, in the light of accumulating evidence for missing genes, fragmentary gene structures, false annotations and a low rate of functional annotations on the original release, we decided to improve the moss genome annotation.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we report the complete moss genome re-annotation (designated V1.6) incorporating the increased transcript availability from a multitude of developmental stages and tissue types. We demonstrate the utility of the improved P. patens genome annotation for comparative genomics and new extensions to the cosmoss.org resource as a central repository for this plant ""flagship"" genome. The structural annotation of 32,275 protein-coding genes results in 8387 additional loci including 1456 loci with known protein domains or homologs in Plantae. This is the first release to include information on transcript isoforms, suggesting alternative splicing events for at least 10.8% of the loci. Furthermore, this release now also provides information on non-protein-coding loci. Functional annotations were improved regarding quality and coverage, resulting in 58% annotated loci (previously: 41%) that comprise also 7200 additional loci with GO annotations. Access and manual curation of the functional and structural genome annotation is provided via the http://www.cosmoss.org model organism database.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Comparative analysis of gene structure evolution along the green plant lineage provides novel insights, such as a comparatively high number of loci with 5'-UTR introns in the moss.

Data on phytate is available in very few composition tables, for a limited number of foods and mainly for raw products. With the aim of publishing the first global repository of analytical data on phytate, data on moisture, phytate, zinc, iron and calcium were compiled. Other aspects, such as the analytical method used, biodiversity and processing, were considered, and phytate: mineral ratios were calculated when possible. From a comprehensive literature search, over 250 references were compiled, generating 3377 entries: 39% for raw and 61% for processed foods. Most of the entries were for cereals (35%), followed by legumes (27%) and vegetables (11%). The most common analytical methods used were indirect precipitation (26%) and anion exchange (25%), while separate determination of IPs is the most recommended. The database can be used as a tool for nutrition workers to include into food composition tables and to develop programmes related to mineral deficiencies. These data will be useful for designing diets with enhanced mineral bioavailability and for improving the estimates for nutrient requirements.

23292738,A comprehensive SNP and indel imputability database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genotype imputation has become an indispensible step in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Imputation accuracy, directly influencing downstream analysis, has shown to be improved using re-sequencing-based reference panels; however, this comes at the cost of high computational burden due to the huge number of potentially imputable markers (tens of millions) discovered through sequencing a large number of individuals. Therefore, there is an increasing need for access to imputation quality information without actually conducting imputation. To facilitate this process, we have established a publicly available SNP and indel imputability database, aiming to provide direct access to imputation accuracy information for markers identified by the 1000 Genomes Project across four major populations and covering multiple GWAS genotyping platforms.<h4>Results</h4>SNP and indel imputability information can be retrieved through a user-friendly interface by providing the ID(s) of the desired variant(s) or by specifying the desired genomic region. The query results can be refined by selecting relevant GWAS genotyping platform(s). This is the first database providing variant imputability information specific to each continental group and to each genotyping platform. In Filipino individuals from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, our database can achieve an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.97, 0.91, 0.88 and 0.79 for markers with minor allele frequency >5%, 3-5%, 1-3% and 0.5-1%, respectively. Specifically, by filtering out 48.6% of markers (corresponding to a reduction of up to 48.6% in computational costs for actual imputation) based on the imputability information in our database, we can remove 77%, 58%, 51% and 42% of the poorly imputed markers at the cost of only 0.3%, 0.8%, 1.5% and 4.6% of the well-imputed markers with minor allele frequency >5%, 3-5%, 1-3% and 0.5-1%, respectively.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/imputability.html",False,True,,0.65607154,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/imputability.html,http://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/imputability.html,True,"...-3% and 0.5-1%, respectively.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/imputability.html",1,False,False,False
29092937,An Accessible Proteogenomics Informatics Resource for Cancer Researchers.,"Proteogenomics has emerged as a valuable approach in cancer research, which integrates genomic and transcriptomic data with mass spectrometry-based proteomics data to directly identify expressed, variant protein sequences that may have functional roles in cancer. This approach is computationally intensive, requiring integration of disparate software tools into sophisticated workflows, challenging its adoption by nonexpert, bench scientists. To address this need, we have developed an extensible, Galaxy-based resource aimed at providing more researchers access to, and training in, proteogenomic informatics. Our resource brings together software from several leading research groups to address two foundational aspects of proteogenomics: (i) generation of customized, annotated protein sequence databases from RNA-Seq data; and (ii) accurate matching of tandem mass spectrometry data to putative variants, followed by filtering to confirm their novelty.

25750664,Stereoselective virtual screening of the ZINC database using atom pair 3D-fingerprints.,"<h4>Background</h4>Tools to explore large compound databases in search for analogs of query molecules provide a strategically important support in drug discovery to help identify available analogs of any given reference or hit compound by ligand based virtual screening (LBVS). We recently showed that large databases can be formatted for very fast searching with various 2D-fingerprints using the city-block distance as similarity measure, in particular a 2D-atom pair fingerprint (APfp) and the related category extended atom pair fingerprint (Xfp) which efficiently encode molecular shape and pharmacophores, but do not perceive stereochemistry. Here we investigated related 3D-atom pair fingerprints to enable rapid stereoselective searches in the ZINC database (23.2 million 3D structures).<h4>Results</h4>Molecular fingerprints counting atom pairs at increasing through-space distance intervals were designed using either all atoms (16-bit 3DAPfp) or different atom categories (80-bit 3DXfp). These 3D-fingerprints retrieved molecular shape and pharmacophore analogs (defined by OpenEye ROCS scoring functions) of 110,000 compounds from the Cambridge Structural Database with equal or better accuracy than the 2D-fingerprints APfp and Xfp, and showed comparable performance in recovering actives from decoys in the DUD database. LBVS by 3DXfp or 3DAPfp similarity was stereoselective and gave very different analogs when starting from different diastereomers of the same chiral drug. Results were also different from LBVS with the parent 2D-fingerprints Xfp or APfp. 3D- and 2D-fingerprints also gave very different results in LBVS of folded molecules where through-space distances between atom pairs are much shorter than topological distances.<h4>Conclusions</h4>3DAPfp and 3DXfp are suitable for stereoselective searches for shape and pharmacophore analogs of query molecules in large databases. Web-browsers for searching ZINC by 3DAPfp and 3DXfp similarity are accessible at www.gdb.unibe.ch and should provide useful assistance to drug discovery projects.

26669149,[A Terahertz Spectral Database Based on Browser/Server Technique].,"With the solution of key scientific and technical problems and development of instrumentation, the application of terahertz technology in various fields has been paid more and more attention. Owing to the unique characteristic advantages, terahertz technology has been showing a broad future in the fields of fast, non-damaging detections, as well as many other fields. Terahertz technology combined with other complementary methods can be used to cope with many difficult practical problems which could not be solved before. One of the critical points for further development of practical terahertz detection methods depends on a good and reliable terahertz spectral database. We developed a BS (browser/server) -based terahertz spectral database recently. We designed the main structure and main functions to fulfill practical requirements. The terahertz spectral database now includes more than 240 items, and the spectral information was collected based on three sources: (1) collection and citation from some other abroad terahertz spectral databases; (2) collected from published literatures; and (3) spectral data measured in our laboratory. The present paper introduced the basic structure and fundament functions of the terahertz spectral database developed in our laboratory. One of the key functions of this THz database is calculation of optical parameters. Some optical parameters including absorption coefficient, refractive index, etc. can be calculated based on the input THz time domain spectra. The other main functions and searching methods of the browser/server-based terahertz spectral database have been discussed. The database search system can provide users convenient functions including user registration, inquiry, displaying spectral figures and molecular structures, spectral matching, etc. The THz database system provides an on-line searching function for registered users. Registered users can compare the input THz spectrum with the spectra of database, according to the obtained correlation coefficient one can perform the searching task very fast and conveniently. Our terahertz spectral database can be accessed at http://www.teralibrary.com. The proposed terahertz spectral database is based on spectral information so far, and will be improved in the future.

These changes reflect recent progress in identification, cloning, and sequencing of allergens. The goals of this update were to increase consistency in the classification of allergens, isoallergens, and variants and in the incorporation of the evolutionary classification of proteins into allergen nomenclature, while keeping changes of established names to a minimum in the interest of continuity. Allergens for which names have been updated include respiratory allergens from birch and ragweed pollen, midge larvae, and horse dander; food allergens from peanut, cow's milk, and tomato; and cereal grain allergens. The IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Sub-Committee encourages researchers to use these updated allergen names in future publications.",False,True,,0.6506481,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://www.allergen.org,http://www.allergen.org,True,,1,False,False,False
33750297,Rust expression browser: an open source database for simultaneous analysis of host and pathogen gene expression profiles with expVIP.,"<h4>Background</h4>Transcriptomics is being increasingly applied to generate new insight into the interactions between plants and their pathogens. For the wheat yellow (stripe) rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) RNA-based sequencing (RNA-Seq) has proved particularly valuable, overcoming the barriers associated with its obligate biotrophic nature. This includes the application of RNA-Seq approaches to study Pst and wheat gene expression dynamics over time and the Pst population composition through the use of a novel RNA-Seq based surveillance approach called ""field pathogenomics"". As a dual RNA-Seq approach, the field pathogenomics technique also provides gene expression data from the host, giving new insight into host responses. However, this has created a wealth of data for interrogation.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we used the field pathogenomics approach to generate 538 new RNA-Seq datasets from Pst-infected field wheat samples, doubling the amount of transcriptomics data available for this important pathosystem. We then analysed these datasets alongside 66 RNA-Seq datasets from four Pst infection time-courses and 420 Pst-infected plant field and laboratory samples that were publicly available. A database of gene expression values for Pst and wheat was generated for each of these 1024 RNA-Seq datasets and incorporated into the development of the rust expression browser ( http://www.rust-expression.com ). This enables for the first time simultaneous 'point-and-click' access to gene expression profiles for Pst and its wheat host and represents the largest database of processed RNA-Seq datasets available for any of the three Puccinia wheat rust pathogens. We also demonstrated the utility of the browser through investigation of expression of putative Pst virulence genes over time and examined the host plants response to Pst infection.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The rust expression browser offers immense value to the wider community, facilitating data sharing and transparency and the underlying database can be continually expanded as more datasets become publicly available.",False,True,,0.7079098,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,Rust expression browser,True,False,False,,http://www.rust-expression.com,http://www.rust-expression.com,True,...the development of the rust expression browser ( http://www.rust-expression.com ).
