"23221299, 27171405, 34458863",Targeted journal curation as a method to improve data currency at the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.,"The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that promotes understanding about the effects of environmental chemicals on human health. CTD biocurators read the scientific literature and manually curate a triad of chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease interactions. Typically, articles for CTD are selected using a chemical-centric approach by querying PubMed to retrieve a corpus containing the chemical of interest. Although this technique ensures adequate coverage of knowledge about the chemical (i.e. data completeness), it does not necessarily reflect the most current state of all toxicological research in the community at large (i.e. data currency). Keeping databases current with the most recent scientific results, as well as providing a rich historical background from legacy articles, is a challenging process. To address this issue of data currency, CTD designed and tested a journal-centric approach of curation to complement our chemical-centric method. We first identified priority journals based on defined criteria. Next, over 7 weeks, three biocurators reviewed 2425 articles from three consecutive years (2009-2011) of three targeted journals. From this corpus, 1252 articles contained relevant data for CTD and 52 752 interactions were manually curated. Here, we describe our journal selection process, two methods of document delivery for the biocurators and the analysis of the resulting curation metrics, including data currency, and both intra-journal and inter-journal comparisons of research topics. Based on our results, we expect that curation by select journals can (i) be easily incorporated into the curation pipeline to complement our chemical-centric approach; (ii) build content more evenly for chemicals, genes and diseases in CTD (rather than biasing data by chemicals-of-interest); (iii) reflect developing areas in environmental health and (iv) improve overall data currency for chemicals, genes and diseases.

"27185889, 29564830",CTLPScanner: a web server for chromothripsis-like pattern detection.,"Chromothripsis is a recently observed phenomenon in cancer cells in which one or several chromosomes shatter into pieces with subsequent inaccurate reassembly and clonal propagation. This type of event generates a potentially vast number of mutations within a relatively short-time period, and has been considered as a new paradigm in cancer development. Despite recent advances, much work is still required to better understand the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, and thus an easy-to-use tool is in urgent need for automatically detecting and annotating chromothripsis. Here we present CTLPScanner, a web server for detection of chromothripsis-like pattern (CTLP) in genomic array data. The output interface presents intuitive graphical representations of detected chromosome pulverization region, as well as detailed results in table format.

26423722,DMAP: a connectivity map database to enable identification of novel drug repositioning candidates.,"<h4>Background</h4>Drug repositioning is a cost-efficient and time-saving process to drug development compared to traditional techniques. A systematic method to drug repositioning is to identify candidate drug's gene expression profiles on target disease models and determine how similar these profiles are to approved drugs. Databases such as the CMAP have been developed recently to help with systematic drug repositioning.<h4>Methods</h4>To overcome the limitation of connectivity maps on data coverage, we constructed a comprehensive in silico drug-protein connectivity map called DMAP, which contains directed drug-to-protein effects and effect scores. The drug-to-protein effect scores are compiled from all database entries between the drug and protein have been previously observed and provide a confidence measure on the quality of such drug-to-protein effects.<h4>Results</h4>In DMAP, we have compiled the direct effects between 24,121 PubChem Compound ID (CID), which were mapped from 289,571 chemical entities recognized from public literature, and 5,196 reviewed Uniprot proteins. DMAP compiles a total of 438,004 chemical-to-protein effect relationships. Compared to CMAP, DMAP shows an increase of 221 folds in the number of chemicals and 1.92 fold in the number of ATC codes. Furthermore, by overlapping DMAP chemicals with the approved drugs with known indications from the TTD database and literature, we obtained 982 drugs and 622 diseases; meanwhile, we only obtained 394 drugs with known indication from CMAP. To validate the feasibility of applying new DMAP for systematic drug repositioning, we compared the performance of DMAP and the well-known CMAP database on two popular computational techniques: drug-drug-similarity-based method with leave-one-out validation and Kolmogorov-Smirnov scoring based method. In drug-drug-similarity-based method, the drug repositioning prediction using DMAP achieved an Area-Under-Curve (AUC) score of 0.82, compared with that using CMAP, AUC = 0.64. For Kolmogorov-Smirnov scoring based method, with DMAP, we were able to retrieve several drug indications which could not be retrieved using CMAP. DMAP data can be queried using the existing C2MAP server or downloaded freely at: http://bio.informatics.iupui.edu/cmaps<h4>Conclusions</h4>Reliable measurements of how drug affect disease-related proteins are critical to ongoing drug development in the genome medicine era.

However, there is a paucity of web servers to conduct fast, focussed, and customized investigations for identifying new uses of old drugs. We present the NOD web server, which has the mentioned characteristics. NOD uses a sensitive sequence-guided approach to identify close and distant homologs of a protein of interest. NOD then exploits this evolutionary information to suggest potential compounds from the DrugBank database that can be repurposed against the input protein. NOD also allows expansion of the chemical space of the potential candidates through similarity searches. We have validated the performance of NOD against available experimental and/or clinical reports.

26527191,Shared bioinformatics databases within the Unipro UGENE platform.,"Unipro UGENE is an open-source bioinformatics toolkit that integrates popular tools along with original instruments for molecular biologists within a unified user interface. Nowadays, most bioinformatics desktop applications, including UGENE, make use of a local data model while processing different types of data. Such an approach causes an inconvenience for scientists working cooperatively and relying on the same data. This refers to the need of making multiple copies of certain files for every workplace and maintaining synchronization between them in case of modifications. Therefore, we focused on delivering a collaborative work into the UGENE user experience. Currently, several UGENE installations can be connected to a designated shared database and users can interact with it simultaneously. Such databases can be created by UGENE users and be used at their discretion. Objects of each data type, supported by UGENE such as sequences, annotations, multiple alignments, etc., can now be easily imported from or exported to a remote storage. One of the main advantages of this system, compared to existing ones, is the almost simultaneous access of client applications to shared data regardless of their volume. Moreover, the system is capable of storing millions of objects. The storage itself is a regular database server so even an inexpert user is able to deploy it. Thus, UGENE may provide access to shared data for users located, for example, in the same laboratory or institution.

Both deep learning and classical algorithms have their merits for drug design. Here, the webserver WADDAICA is built to employ the advantage of deep learning model and classical algorithms for drug design. The WADDAICA mainly contains two modules. In the first module, WADDAICA provides deep learning models for scaffold hopping of compounds to modify or design new novel drugs. The deep learning model which is used in WADDAICA shows a good scoring power based on the PDBbind database. In the second module, WADDAICA supplies functions for modifying or designing new novel drugs by classical algorithms. WADDAICA shows better Pearson and Spearman correlations of binding affinity than Autodock Vina that is considered to have the best scoring power.

31372542,FeptideDB: A web application for new bioactive peptides from food protein.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bioactive peptides derived from food are important sources for alternative medicine and possess therapeutic activity. Several biochemical methods have been achieved to isolate bioactive peptides from food, which are tedious and time consuming. <i>In silico</i> methods are an alternative process to reduce cost and time with respect to bioactive peptide production. In this paper, FeptideDB was used to collect bioactive peptide (BP) data from both published research articles and available bioactive peptide databases. FeptideDB was developed to assist in forecasting bioactive peptides from food by combining peptide cleavage tools and database matching. Furthermore, this application was able to predict the potential of cleaved peptides from <i>'enzyme digestion module'</i> to identify new ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors using an automatic molecular docking approach.<h4>Results</h4>The FeptideDB web application contains tools for generating all possible peptides cleaved from input protein by various available enzymes. This database was also used for analysis and visualization to assist in bioactive peptide discovery.

31796060,Text-mining clinically relevant cancer biomarkers for curation into the CIViC database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Precision oncology involves analysis of individual cancer samples to understand the genes and pathways involved in the development and progression of a cancer. To improve patient care, knowledge of diagnostic, prognostic, predisposing, and drug response markers is essential. Several knowledgebases have been created by different groups to collate evidence for these associations. These include the open-access Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) knowledgebase. These databases rely on time-consuming manual curation from skilled experts who read and interpret the relevant biomedical literature.<h4>Methods</h4>To aid in this curation and provide the greatest coverage for these databases, particularly CIViC, we propose the use of text mining approaches to extract these clinically relevant biomarkers from all available published literature. To this end, a group of cancer genomics experts annotated sentences that discussed biomarkers with their clinical associations and achieved good inter-annotator agreement. We then used a supervised learning approach to construct the CIViCmine knowledgebase.<h4>Results</h4>We extracted 121,589 relevant sentences from PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central Open Access full-text papers. CIViCmine contains over 87,412 biomarkers associated with 8035 genes, 337 drugs, and 572 cancer types, representing 25,818 abstracts and 39,795 full-text publications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through integration with CIVIC, we provide a prioritized list of curatable clinically relevant cancer biomarkers as well as a resource that is valuable to other knowledgebases and precision cancer analysts in general.

33410688,TargetDBP+: Enhancing the Performance of Identifying DNA-Binding Proteins via Weighted Convolutional Features.,"Protein-DNA interactions exist ubiquitously and play important roles in the life cycles of living cells. The accurate identification of DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) is one of the key steps to understand the mechanisms of protein-DNA interactions. Although many DBP identification methods have been proposed, the current performance is still unsatisfactory. In this study, a new method, called TargetDBP+, is developed to further enhance the performance of identifying DBPs. In TargetDBP+, five convolutional features are first extracted from five feature sources, i.e., amino acid one-hot matrix (AAOHM), position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), predicted secondary structure probability matrix (PSSPM), predicted solvent accessibility probability matrix (PSAPM), and predicted probabilities of DNA-binding sites (PPDBSs); second, the five features are weightedly and serially combined using the weights of all of the elements learned by the differential evolution algorithm; and finally, the DBP identification model of TargetDBP+ is trained using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. To evaluate the developed TargetDBP+ and compare it with other existing methods, a new gold-standard benchmark data set, called <i>UniSwiss</i>, is constructed, which consists of 4881 DBPs and 4881 non-DBPs extracted from the UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database. Experimental results demonstrate that TargetDBP+ can obtain an accuracy of 85.83% and precision of 88.45% covering 82.41% of all DBP data on the independent validation subset of <i>UniSwiss</i>, with the MCC value (0.718) being significantly higher than those of other state-of-the-art control methods.

PASS2 is a database that records such alignments for protein domain superfamilies and has been constantly updated periodically. This update of the PASS2 version, named as PASS2.5, directly corresponds to the SCOPe 2.04 release. All SCOPe structural domains that share less than 40% sequence identity, as defined by the ASTRAL compendium of protein structures, are included. The current version includes 1977 superfamilies and has been assembled utilizing the structure-based sequence alignment protocol. Such an alignment is obtained initially through MATT, followed by a refinement through the COMPARER program. The JOY program has been used for structural annotations of such alignments. In this update, we have automated the protocol and focused on inclusion of new features such as mapping of GO terms, absolutely conserved residues among the domains in a superfamily and inclusion of PDBs, that are absent in SCOPe 2.04, using the HMM profiles from the alignments of the superfamily members and are provided as a separate list.

However, accessibility of NGS data remains a problem, and few user-friendly resources exist for integrative analysis of NGS data from different sources and experimental techniques. Here, we present Online Resource for Integrative Omics (ORIO; https://orio.niehs.nih.gov/), a web-based resource with an intuitive user interface for rapid analysis and integration of NGS data. To use ORIO, the user specifies NGS data of interest along with a list of genomic coordinates. Genomic coordinates may be biologically relevant features from a variety of sources, such as ChIP-seq peaks for a given protein or transcription start sites from known gene models. ORIO first iteratively finds read coverage values at each genomic feature for each NGS dataset. Data are then integrated using clustering-based approaches, giving hierarchical relationships across NGS datasets and separating individual genomic features into groups. In focusing its analysis on read coverage, ORIO makes limited assumptions about the analyzed data; this allows the tool to be applied across data from a variety of experiments and techniques. Results from analysis are presented in dynamic displays alongside user-controlled statistical tests, supporting rapid statistical validation of observed results. We emphasize the versatility of ORIO through diverse examples, ranging from NGS data quality control to characterization of enhancer regions and integration of gene expression information.

22230096,ProFASTA: a pipeline web server for fungal protein scanning with integration of cell surface prediction software.,"Surface proteins, such as those located in the cell wall of fungi, play an important role in the interaction with the surrounding environment. For instance, they mediate primary host-pathogen interactions and are crucial to the establishment of biofilms and fungal infections. Surface localization of proteins is determined by specific sequence features and can be predicted by combining different freely available web servers. However, user-friendly tools that allow rapid analysis of large datasets (whole proteomes or larger) in subsequent analyses were not yet available. Here, we present the web tool ProFASTA, which integrates multiple tools for rapid scanning of protein sequence properties in large datasets and returns sequences in FASTA format.

34058973,GLEANER: a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetic Roadmap visualization.,"<h4>Background</h4>Germline cells are important carriers of genetic and epigenetic information transmitted across generations in mammals. During the mammalian germline cell development cycle (i.e., the germline cycle), cell potency changes cyclically, accompanied by dynamic transcriptional changes and epigenetic reprogramming. Recently, to understand these dynamic and regulatory mechanisms, multiomic analyses, including transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications of germline cells, have been performed for different stages in human and mouse germline cycles. However, the long time span of the germline cycle and material scarcity of germline cells have largely limited the understanding of these dynamic characteristic changes. A tool that integrates the existing multiomics data and visualizes the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle can partially overcome such limitations.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present GLEANER, a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetics Roadmap visualization. GLEANER provides a comprehensive collection of the transcriptome, DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility, and H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 histone modification characteristics in human and mouse germline cycles. For each input gene, GLEANER shows the integrative analysis results of its transcriptional and epigenetic features, the genes with correlated transcriptional changes, and the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle. We further used two case studies to demonstrate the detailed functionality of GLEANER and highlighted that it can provide valuable clues to the epigenetic regulation mechanisms in the genetic and epigenetic information transmitted during the germline cycle.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To the best of our knowledge, GLEANER is the first web server dedicated to the analysis and visualization of multiomics data related to the mammalian germline cycle.

To date, nearly 20,000 of PPIs from Arabidopsis thaliana have been identified. Nevertheless, the interaction site information has been largely missed by previously published PPI databases. Here, AraPPISite, a database that presents fine-grained interaction details for A. thaliana PPIs is established. First, the experimentally determined 3D structures of 27 A. thaliana PPIs are collected from the Protein Data Bank database and the predicted 3D structures of 3023 A. thaliana PPIs are modeled by using two well-established template-based docking methods. For each experimental/predicted complex structure, AraPPISite not only provides an interactive user interface for browsing interaction sites, but also lists detailed evolutionary and physicochemical properties of these sites. Second, AraPPISite assigns domain-domain interactions or domain-motif interactions to 4286 PPIs whose 3D structures cannot be modeled. In this case, users can easily query protein interaction regions at the sequence level. AraPPISite is a free and user-friendly database, which does not require user registration or any configuration on local machines. We anticipate AraPPISite can serve as a helpful database resource for the users with less experience in structural biology or protein bioinformatics to probe the details of PPIs, and thus accelerate the studies of plant genetics and functional genomics.

31555312,MaizeDIG: Maize Database of Images and Genomes.,"<b>Background:</b> An organism can be described by its observable features (phenotypes) and the genes and genomic information (genotypes) that cause these phenotypes. For many decades, researchers have tried to find relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, and great strides have been made. However, improved methods and tools for discovering and visualizing these phenotypic relationships are still needed. The maize genetics and genomics database (MaizeGDB, www.maizegdb.org) provides an array of useful resources for diverse data types including thousands of images related to mutant phenotypes in <i>Zea mays</i> ssp. <i>mays</i> (maize). To integrate mutant phenotype images with genomics information, we implemented and enhanced the web-based software package BioDIG (Biological Database of Images and Genomes). <b>Findings:</b> We developed a genotype-phenotype database for maize called MaizeDIG. MaizeDIG has several enhancements over the original BioDIG package. MaizeDIG, which supports multiple reference genome assemblies, is seamlessly integrated with genome browsers to accommodate custom tracks showing tagged mutant phenotypes images in their genomic context and allows for custom tagging of images to highlight the phenotype. This is accomplished through an updated interface allowing users to create image-to-gene links and is accessible <i>via</i> the image search tool. <b>Conclusions:</b> We have created a user-friendly and extensible web-based resource called MaizeDIG. MaizeDIG is preloaded with 2,396 images that are available on genome browsers for 10 different maize reference genomes. Approximately 90 images of classically defined maize genes have been manually annotated. MaizeDIG is available at http://maizedig.maizegdb.org/.

33882120,APICURON: a database to credit and acknowledge the work of biocurators.,"APICURON is an open and freely accessible resource that tracks and credits the work of biocurators across multiple participating knowledgebases. Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data-mainly from literature-requires a huge effort that is difficult to attribute and quantify. APICURON collects biocuration events from third-party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources and for biocurators themselves. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities. Biocurators are identified through their Open Researcher and Contributor ID. The definition of curation events, scoring systems and rules for assigning badges and medals are resource-specific and easily customizable. Registered resources can transfer curation activities on the fly through a secure and robust Application Programming Interface (API). Here, we show how simple and effective it is to connect a resource to APICURON, describing the DisProt database of intrinsically disordered proteins as a use case. We believe APICURON will provide biological knowledgebases with a service to recognize and credit the effort of their biocurators, monitor their activity and promote curator engagement.

26792120,Protein Sequence Annotation Tool (PSAT): a centralized web-based meta-server for high-throughput sequence annotations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Here we introduce the Protein Sequence Annotation Tool (PSAT), a web-based, sequence annotation meta-server for performing integrated, high-throughput, genome-wide sequence analyses. Our goals in building PSAT were to (1) create an extensible platform for integration of multiple sequence-based bioinformatics tools, (2) enable functional annotations and enzyme predictions over large input protein fasta data sets, and (3) provide a web interface for convenient execution of the tools.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of PSAT by annotating the predicted peptide gene products of Herbaspirillum sp. strain RV1423, importing the results of PSAT into EC2KEGG, and using the resulting functional comparisons to identify a putative catabolic pathway, thereby distinguishing RV1423 from a well annotated Herbaspirillum species. This analysis demonstrates that high-throughput enzyme predictions, provided by PSAT processing, can be used to identify metabolic potential in an otherwise poorly annotated genome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PSAT is a meta server that combines the results from several sequence-based annotation and function prediction codes, and is available at http://psat.llnl.gov/psat/. PSAT stands apart from other sequence-based genome annotation systems in providing a high-throughput platform for rapid de novo enzyme predictions and sequence annotations over large input protein sequence data sets in FASTA.

22008641,MrBac: a web server for draft metabolic network reconstructions for bacteria.,"Genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction can be used for simulating cellular behaviors by simultaneously monitoring thousands of biochemical reactions, and is therefore important for systems biology studies in microbes. However, the labor-intensive and time-consuming reconstruction process has hindered the progress of this important field. Here we present a web server, MrBac (Metabolic network Reconstructions for Bacteria), to streamline the network reconstruction process for draft genome-scale metabolic networks and to provide annotation information from multiple databases for further curation of the draft reconstructions. MrBac integrates comparative genomics, retrieval of genome annotations, and generation of standard systems biology file format ready for network analyses. We also used MrBac to automatically generate a draft metabolic model of Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium LT2.

31432427,Essential Features and Use Cases of the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Resource (CSF-PR).,"Every year, a large number of published studies present biomarkers for various neurological disorders. Many of these studies are based on mass spectrometry proteomics data and describe comparison of the abundance of proteins in cerebrospinal fluid between two or more disease groups. As the number of such studies is growing, it is no longer straightforward to obtain an overview of which specific proteins are increased or decreased between the numerous relevant diseases and their many subcategories, or to see the larger picture or trends between related diseases. To alleviate this situation, we therefore mined the literature for mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies including quantitative protein data from cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and organized the extracted data in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Resource (CSF-PR).

Ecologists have produced a massive amount of data to cope with the crisis. Accordingly, many national scale ecological database systems have been developed worldwide to manage and analyse these datasets. However, in Korea, ecological datasets produced by different research institutes for different purposes have not been integrated or serviced due to poorly designed information infrastructure. To address this obstacle, we present EcoBank (www.nie-ecobank.kr), an open, web-based ecological database platform designed to play an important role in ecosystem analysis, not only in Korea, but also worldwide.<h4>New information</h4>The architecture of EcoBank comprises core technologies of WebGIS, Application Programming Interface (API), responsive web and open-source software (OSS).

26208093,"GREAM: A Web Server to Short-List Potentially Important Genomic Repeat Elements Based on Over-/Under-Representation in Specific Chromosomal Locations, Such as the Gene Neighborhoods, within or across 17 Mammalian Species.","<h4>Background</h4>Genome-wide repeat sequences, such as LINEs, SINEs and LTRs share a considerable part of the mammalian nuclear genomes. These repeat elements seem to be important for multiple functions including the regulation of transcription initiation, alternative splicing and DNA methylation. But it is not possible to study all repeats and, hence, it would help to short-list before exploring their potential functional significance via experimental studies and/or detailed in silico analyses.<h4>Result</h4>We developed the 'Genomic Repeat Element Analyzer for Mammals' (GREAM) for analysis, screening and selection of potentially important mammalian genomic repeats. This web-server offers many novel utilities. For example, this is the only tool that can reveal a categorized list of specific types of transposons, retro-transposons and other genome-wide repetitive elements that are statistically over-/under-represented in regions around a set of genes, such as those expressed differentially in a disease condition. The output displays the position and frequency of identified elements within the specified regions. In addition, GREAM offers two other types of analyses of genomic repeat sequences: a) enrichment within chromosomal region(s) of interest, and b) comparative distribution across the neighborhood of orthologous genes. GREAM successfully short-listed a repeat element (MER20) known to contain functional motifs. In other case studies, we could use GREAM to short-list repetitive elements in the azoospermia factor a (AZFa) region of the human Y chromosome and those around the genes associated with rat liver injury. GREAM could also identify five over-represented repeats around some of the human and mouse transcription factor coding genes that had conserved expression patterns across the two species.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GREAM has been developed to provide an impetus to research on the role of repetitive sequences in mammalian genomes by offering easy selection of more interesting repeats in various contexts/regions.

This paper describes substantial improvements made to the BCL::Conf algorithm and a transition to a rotamer library derived from molecules in the Crystallography Open Database (COD, no license required). We demonstrate the performance of the new BCL::Conf on native conformer recovery in the Platinum dataset of high-quality protein-ligand complexes. This set of 2859 structures has previously been used to assess the performance of over a dozen conformer generation algorithms, including the Conformator, Balloon, RDKit DG, ETKDG, Confab, Frog2, MultiConf-DOCK, CSD conformer generator, ConfGenX-OPSL3 force field, Omega, excalc, iCon, and MOE. These benchmarks suggest that the CSD conformer generator is at the state of the art of reported conformer generators. Our results indicate that the improved BCL::Conf significantly outperforms the CSD conformer generation algorithm at binding conformer recovery across a range of ensemble sizes and with similarly fast rates of conformer generation.

Despite its free availability to academic users and improving documentation, use of Rosetta has largely remained confined to developers and their immediate collaborators due to the code's difficulty of use, the requirement for large computational resources, and the unavailability of servers for most of the Rosetta applications. Here, we present a unified web framework for Rosetta applications called ROSIE (Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone).

28610638,BADERI: an online database to coordinate handsearching activities of controlled clinical trials for their potential inclusion in systematic reviews.,"<h4>Background</h4>Systematic reviews provide the best evidence on the effect of health care interventions. They rely on comprehensive access to the available scientific literature. Electronic search strategies alone may not suffice, requiring the implementation of a handsearching approach. We have developed a database to provide an Internet-based platform from which handsearching activities can be coordinated, including a procedure to streamline the submission of these references into CENTRAL, the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a database and a descriptive analysis. Through brainstorming and discussion among stakeholders involved in handsearching projects, we designed a database that met identified needs that had to be addressed in order to ensure the viability of handsearching activities. Three handsearching teams pilot tested the proposed database. Once the final version of the database was approved, we proceeded to train the staff involved in handsearching.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed database is called BADERI (Database of Iberoamerican Clinical Trials and Journals, by its initials in Spanish). BADERI was officially launched in October 2015, and it can be accessed at www.baderi.com/login.php free of cost. BADERI has an administration subsection, from which the roles of users are managed; a references subsection, where information associated to identified controlled clinical trials (CCTs) can be entered; a reports subsection, from which reports can be generated to track and analyse the results of handsearching activities; and a built-in free text search engine. BADERI allows all references to be exported in ProCite files that can be directly uploaded into CENTRAL. To date, 6284 references to CCTs have been uploaded to BADERI and sent to CENTRAL.

21933848,The curation paradigm and application tool used for manual curation of the scientific literature at the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.,"The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that promotes understanding about the effects of environmental chemicals on human health. CTD biocurators read the scientific literature and convert free-text information into a structured format using official nomenclature, integrating third party controlled vocabularies for chemicals, genes, diseases and organisms, and a novel controlled vocabulary for molecular interactions. Manual curation produces a robust, richly annotated dataset of highly accurate and detailed information. Currently, CTD describes over 349,000 molecular interactions between 6800 chemicals, 20,900 genes (for 330 organisms) and 4300 diseases that have been manually curated from over 25,400 peer-reviewed articles. This manually curated data are further integrated with other third party data (e.g. Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome annotations) to generate a wealth of toxicogenomic relationships. Here, we describe our approach to manual curation that uses a powerful and efficient paradigm involving mnemonic codes. This strategy allows biocurators to quickly capture detailed information from articles by generating simple statements using codes to represent the relationships between data types. The paradigm is versatile, expandable, and able to accommodate new data challenges that arise.

For this purpose, we added modules in InterEvDock2 for automatic template search and comparative modeling of the input proteins. The InterEvDock2 pipeline was benchmarked on 812 complexes for which unbound homology models of the two partners and co-evolutionary information are available in the PPI4DOCK database. InterEvDock2 identified a correct model among the top 10 consensus in 29% of these cases (compared to 15-24% for individual scoring functions) and at least one correct interface residue among 10 predicted in 91% of these cases. InterEvDock2 is thus a unique protein docking server, designed to be useful for the experimental biology community.

25619558,OntoMate: a text-mining tool aiding curation at the Rat Genome Database.,"The Rat Genome Database (RGD) is the premier repository of rat genomic, genetic and physiologic data. Converting data from free text in the scientific literature to a structured format is one of the main tasks of all model organism databases. RGD spends considerable effort manually curating gene, Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) and strain information. The rapidly growing volume of biomedical literature and the active research in the biological natural language processing (bioNLP) community have given RGD the impetus to adopt text-mining tools to improve curation efficiency. Recently, RGD has initiated a project to use OntoMate, an ontology-driven, concept-based literature search engine developed at RGD, as a replacement for the PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) search engine in the gene curation workflow. OntoMate tags abstracts with gene names, gene mutations, organism name and most of the 16 ontologies/vocabularies used at RGD. All terms/ entities tagged to an abstract are listed with the abstract in the search results. All listed terms are linked both to data entry boxes and a term browser in the curation tool. OntoMate also provides user-activated filters for species, date and other parameters relevant to the literature search. Using the system for literature search and import has streamlined the process compared to using PubMed. The system was built with a scalable and open architecture, including features specifically designed to accelerate the RGD gene curation process. With the use of bioNLP tools, RGD has added more automation to its curation workflow.

32527260,PINOT: an intuitive resource for integrating protein-protein interactions.,"<h4>Background</h4>The past decade has seen the rise of omics data for the understanding of biological systems in health and disease. This wealth of information includes protein-protein interaction (PPI) data derived from both low- and high-throughput assays, which are curated into multiple databases that capture the extent of available information from the peer-reviewed literature. Although these curation efforts are extremely useful, reliably downloading and integrating PPI data from the variety of available repositories is challenging and time consuming.<h4>Methods</h4>We here present a novel user-friendly web-resource called PINOT (Protein Interaction Network Online Tool; available at http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/PINOT/PINOT_form.html) to optimise the collection and processing of PPI data from IMEx consortium associated repositories (members and observers) and WormBase, for constructing, respectively, human and Caenorhabditis elegans PPI networks.<h4>Results</h4>Users submit a query containing a list of proteins of interest for which PINOT extracts data describing PPIs. At every query submission PPI data are downloaded, merged and quality assessed. Then each PPI is confidence scored based on the number of distinct methods used for interaction detection and the number of publications that report the specific interaction. Examples of how PINOT can be applied are provided to highlight the performance, ease of use and potential utility of this tool.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PINOT is a tool that allows users to survey the curated literature, extracting PPI data in relation to a list of proteins of interest. PINOT extracts a similar numbers of PPIs as other, analogous, tools and incorporates a set of innovative features. PINOT is able to process large queries, it downloads human PPIs live through PSICQUIC and it applies quality control filters on the downloaded PPI data (i.e. removing the need for manual inspection by the user). PINOT provides the user with information on detection methods and publication history for each downloaded interaction data entry and outputs the results in a table format that can be straightforwardly further customised and/or directly uploaded into network visualization software.

EMAGE is unique in providing both text-based descriptions of gene expression plus spatial maps of gene expression patterns. This mapping allows spatial queries to be accomplished alongside more traditional text-based queries. Here, we describe our recent progress in spatial mapping and data integration. EMAGE has developed a method of spatially mapping 3D embryo images captured using optical projection tomography, and through the use of an IIP3D viewer allows users to view arbitrary sections of raw and mapped 3D image data in the context of a web browser. EMAGE now includes enhancer data, and we have spatially mapped images from a comprehensive screen of transgenic reporter mice that detail the expression of mouse non-coding genomic DNA fragments with enhancer activity. We have integrated the eMouseAtlas anatomical atlas and the EMAGE database so that a user of the atlas can query the EMAGE database easily.

31127704,VCF-Server: A web-based visualization tool for high-throughput variant data mining and management.,"<h4>Background</h4>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely used in both clinics and research. It has become the most powerful tool for diagnosing genetic disorders and investigating disease etiology through the discovery of genetic variants. Variants identified by NGS are stored in variant call format (VCF) files. However, querying and filtering VCF files are extremely difficult for researchers without programming skills. Furthermore, as the mutation data are increasing exponentially, there is an urgent need to develop tools to manage these variant data in a centralized way.<h4>Methods</h4>The VCF-Server was developed as a web-based visualization tool to support the interactive analysis of genetic variant data. It allows researchers and medical geneticists to manage, annotate, filter, query, and export variants in a fast and effective way.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed the VCF-Server, a powerful and easily accessible tool for researchers and medical geneticists to perform variant analysis. Users can query VCFs, annotate, and filter variants without knowing programming code. Once the VCF file is uploaded, VCF-Server allows users to annotate the VCF with commonly used databases or user-defined variant annotations (including variant blacklist and whitelist). Variant information in the VCF is shown visually via the interactive graphical interface. Users can filter the variants with flexible filtering rules, and the prioritized variants can be exported locally for further analysis. As VCF-Server adopts a web file system, files in the VCF-Server can be stored and managed in a centralized way. Moreover, VCF-Server allows direct web-based analysis (accessible through either desktop computers or mobile devices) as well as local deployment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>With an easy-to-use graphical interface, VCF-Server allows researchers with little bioinformatics background to explore and mine mutation data, which may broaden the application of NGS technology in clinics and research.

22434833,MEDIC: a practical disease vocabulary used at the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.,"The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that promotes understanding about the effects of environmental chemicals on human health. CTD biocurators manually curate a triad of chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease relationships from the scientific literature. The CTD curation paradigm uses controlled vocabularies for chemicals, genes and diseases. To curate disease information, CTD first had to identify a source of controlled terms. Two resources seemed to be good candidates: the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and the 'Diseases' branch of the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headers (MeSH). To maximize the advantages of both, CTD biocurators undertook a novel initiative to map the flat list of OMIM disease terms into the hierarchical nature of the MeSH vocabulary. The result is CTD's 'merged disease vocabulary' (MEDIC), a unique resource that integrates OMIM terms, synonyms and identifiers with MeSH terms, synonyms, definitions, identifiers and hierarchical relationships. MEDIC is both a deep and broad vocabulary, composed of 9700 unique diseases described by more than 67 000 terms (including synonyms). It is freely available to download in various formats from CTD. While neither a true ontology nor a perfect solution, this vocabulary has nonetheless proved to be extremely successful and practical for our biocurators in generating over 2.5 million disease-associated toxicogenomic relationships in CTD. Other external databases have also begun to adopt MEDIC for their disease vocabulary. Here, we describe the construction, implementation, maintenance and use of MEDIC to raise awareness of this resource and to offer it as a putative scaffold in the formal construction of an official disease ontology.

26335387,SFESA: a web server for pairwise alignment refinement by secondary structure shifts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein sequence alignment is essential for a variety of tasks such as homology modeling and active site prediction. Alignment errors remain the main cause of low-quality structure models. A bioinformatics tool to refine alignments is needed to make protein alignments more accurate.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the SFESA web server to refine pairwise protein sequence alignments. Compared to the previous version of SFESA, which required a set of 3D coordinates for a protein, the new server will search a sequence database for the closest homolog with an available 3D structure to be used as a template. For each alignment block defined by secondary structure elements in the template, SFESA evaluates alignment variants generated by local shifts and selects the best-scoring alignment variant. A scoring function that combines the sequence score of profile-profile comparison and the structure score of template-derived contact energy is used for evaluation of alignments. PROMALS pairwise alignments refined by SFESA are more accurate than those produced by current advanced alignment methods such as HHpred and CNFpred. In addition, SFESA also improves alignments generated by other software.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SFESA is a web-based tool for alignment refinement, designed for researchers to compute, refine, and evaluate pairwise alignments with a combined sequence and structure scoring of alignment blocks. To our knowledge, the SFESA web server is the only tool that refines alignments by evaluating local shifts of secondary structure elements.

21255607,"Aromatic-Aromatic Interactions Database, A(2)ID: an analysis of aromatic π-networks in proteins.","The geometrical arrangement of the aromatic rings of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and histidine has been analyzed at a database level using the X-ray crystal structure of proteins from PDB in order to find out the aromatic-aromatic (π-π) networks in proteins and to understand how these aromatic rings are connected with each-other in a specific π-π network. A stringent examination of the 7848 proteins indicates that close to 89% of the proteins have occurrence of at least a network of 2π or a higher π-π network. The occurrence of π-π networks in various protein superfamilies based on SCOP, CATH and EC classifiers has also been probed in the present work. In general, we find that multidomain and membrane proteins as well as lyases show a more number of these networks. Analysis of the distribution of angle between planes of two proximal aromatic rings (ϕ) distribution indicates that at a larger cutoff distance (between centroid of two aromatic rings), above 5Å, C-H⋯π interactions (T-shaped orientation) are more prevalent, while π-π interactions (stacked orientation) are more prevalent at a smaller cutoff distance. The connectivity patterns of π-π networks propose strong propensity of finding arrangement of aromatic residues as clusters rather than linear arrangement.

22923303,COMPADRE: an R and web resource for pathway activity analysis by component decompositions.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>The analysis of biological networks has become essential to study functional genomic data. Compadre is a tool to estimate pathway/gene sets activity indexes using sub-matrix decompositions for biological networks analyses. The Compadre pipeline also includes one of the direct uses of activity indexes to detect altered gene sets. For this, the gene expression sub-matrix of a gene set is decomposed into components, which are used to test differences between groups of samples. This procedure is performed with and without differentially expressed genes to decrease false calls. During this process, Compadre also performs an over-representation test. Compadre already implements four decomposition methods [principal component analysis (PCA), Isomaps, independent component analysis (ICA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)], six statistical tests (t- and f-test, SAM, Kruskal-Wallis, Welch and Brown-Forsythe), several gene sets (KEGG, BioCarta, Reactome, GO and MsigDB) and can be easily expanded. Our simulation results shown in Supplementary Information suggest that Compadre detects more pathways than over-representation tools like David, Babelomics and Webgestalt and less false positives than PLAGE. The output is composed of results from decomposition and over-representation analyses providing a more complete biological picture. Examples provided in Supplementary Information show the utility, versatility and simplicity of Compadre for analyses of biological networks.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Compadre is freely available at http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx:8080/compadre.

31735953,Identification of tRNA-derived ncRNAs in TCGA and NCI-60 panel cell lines and development of the public database tRFexplorer.,"Next-generation sequencing is increasing our understanding and knowledge of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), elucidating their roles in molecular mechanisms and processes such as cell growth and development. Within such a class, tRNA-derived ncRNAs have been recently associated with gene expression regulation in cancer progression. In this paper, we characterize, for the first time, tRNA-derived ncRNAs in NCI-60. Furthermore, we assess their expression profile in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our comprehensive analysis allowed us to report 322 distinct tRNA-derived ncRNAs in NCI-60, categorized in tRNA-derived fragments (11 tRF-5s, 55 tRF-3s), tRNA-derived small RNAs (107 tsRNAs) and tRNA 5' leader RNAs (149 sequences identified). In TCGA, we were able to identify 232 distinct tRNA-derived ncRNAs categorized in 53 tRF-5s, 58 tRF-3s, 63 tsRNAs and 58 5' leader RNAs. This latter group represents an additional evidence of tRNA-derived ncRNAs originating from the 5' leader region of precursor tRNA. We developed a public database, tRFexplorer, which provides users with the expression profile of each tRNA-derived ncRNAs in every cell line in NCI-60 as well as for each TCGA tumor type. Moreover, the system allows us to perform differential expression analyses of such fragments in TCGA, as well as correlation analyses of tRNA-derived ncRNAs expression in TCGA and NCI-60 with gene and miRNA expression in TCGA samples, in association with all omics and compound activities data available on CellMiner.

Towards this goal, we developed TFmotifView, a web server that allows to study the distribution of known TF motifs in genomic regions. Based on input genomic regions and selected TF motifs, TFmotifView performs an overlap of the genomic regions with TF motif occurrences identified using a dynamic P-value threshold. TFmotifView generates three different outputs: (i) an enrichment table and scatterplot calculating the significance of TF motif occurrences in genomic regions compared to control regions, (ii) a genomic view of the organisation of TF motifs in each genomic region and (iii) a metaplot summarizing the position of TF motifs relative to the center of the regions. TFmotifView will contribute to the integration of TF motif information with a wide range of genomic datasets towards the goal to better understand the regulation of gene expression by transcription factors.

Delineating the antibody repertoire has advanced our understanding of humoral immunity, facilitated antibody discovery, and showed great potential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of disease. However, no tool to date has effectively integrated big Rep-seq data and prior knowledge of functional antibodies to elucidate the remarkably diverse antibody repertoire. We developed a Rep-seq dataset Analysis Platform with an Integrated antibody Database (RAPID; https://rapid.zzhlab.org/), a free and web-based tool that allows researchers to process and analyse Rep-seq datasets. RAPID consolidates 521 WHO-recognized therapeutic antibodies, 88,059 antigen- or disease-specific antibodies, and 306 million clones extracted from 2,449 human IGH Rep-seq datasets generated from individuals with 29 different health conditions. RAPID also integrates a standardized Rep-seq dataset analysis pipeline to enable users to upload and analyse their datasets. In the process, users can also select set of existing repertoires for comparison. RAPID automatically annotates clones based on integrated therapeutic and known antibodies, and users can easily query antibodies or repertoires based on sequence or optional keywords.

24829458,RBPmap: a web server for mapping binding sites of RNA-binding proteins.,"Regulation of gene expression is executed in many cases by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind to mRNAs as well as to non-coding RNAs. RBPs recognize their RNA target via specific binding sites on the RNA. Predicting the binding sites of RBPs is known to be a major challenge. We present a new webserver, RBPmap, freely accessible through the website http://rbpmap.technion.ac.il/ for accurate prediction and mapping of RBP binding sites. RBPmap has been developed specifically for mapping RBPs in human, mouse and Drosophila melanogaster genomes, though it supports other organisms too. RBPmap enables the users to select motifs from a large database of experimentally defined motifs. In addition, users can provide any motif of interest, given as either a consensus or a PSSM. The algorithm for mapping the motifs is based on a Weighted-Rank approach, which considers the clustering propensity of the binding sites and the overall tendency of regulatory regions to be conserved. In addition, RBPmap incorporates a position-specific background model, designed uniquely for different genomic regions, such as splice sites, 5' and 3' UTRs, non-coding RNA and intergenic regions. RBPmap was tested on high-throughput RNA-binding experiments and was proved to be highly accurate.",True,False,7.0,,,rbpmap,21.99883735,ok,,,,v2,0.99883735,RBPmap,True,True,True,,http://rbpmap.technion.ac.il/,http://rbpmap.technion.ac.il/,True,"...er, RBPmap, freely accessible through the website http://rbpmap.technion.ac.il/ for accurate prediction and mapping of RBP bindin...",1

27049721,Tissue repair genes: the TiRe database and its implication for skin wound healing.,"Wound healing is an inherent feature of any multicellular organism and recent years have brought about a huge amount of data regarding regular and abnormal tissue repair. Despite the accumulated knowledge, modulation of wound healing is still a major biomedical challenge, especially in advanced ages. In order to collect and systematically organize what we know about the key players in wound healing, we created the TiRe (Tissue Repair) database, an online collection of genes and proteins that were shown to directly affect skin wound healing. To date, TiRe contains 397 entries for four organisms: Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Sus domesticus, and Homo sapiens. Analysis of the TiRe dataset of skin wound healing-associated genes showed that skin wound healing genes are (i) over-conserved among vertebrates, but are under-conserved in invertebrates; (ii) enriched in extracellular and immuno-inflammatory genes; and display (iii) high interconnectivity and connectivity to other proteins. The latter may provide potential therapeutic targets. In addition, a slower or faster skin wound healing is indicative of an aging or longevity phenotype only when assessed in advanced ages, but not in the young. In the long run, we aim for TiRe to be a one-station resource that provides researchers and clinicians with the essential data needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of wound healing, designing new experiments, and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

24124417,MOBBED: a computational data infrastructure for handling large collections of event-rich time series datasets in MATLAB.,"Experiments to monitor human brain activity during active behavior record a variety of modalities (e.g., EEG, eye tracking, motion capture, respiration monitoring) and capture a complex environmental context leading to large, event-rich time series datasets. The considerable variability of responses within and among subjects in more realistic behavioral scenarios requires experiments to assess many more subjects over longer periods of time. This explosion of data requires better computational infrastructure to more systematically explore and process these collections. MOBBED is a lightweight, easy-to-use, extensible toolkit that allows users to incorporate a computational database into their normal MATLAB workflow. Although capable of storing quite general types of annotated data, MOBBED is particularly oriented to multichannel time series such as EEG that have event streams overlaid with sensor data. MOBBED directly supports access to individual events, data frames, and time-stamped feature vectors, allowing users to ask questions such as what types of events or features co-occur under various experimental conditions. A database provides several advantages not available to users who process one dataset at a time from the local file system. In addition to archiving primary data in a central place to save space and avoid inconsistencies, such a database allows users to manage, search, and retrieve events across multiple datasets without reading the entire dataset. The database also provides infrastructure for handling more complex event patterns that include environmental and contextual conditions. The database can also be used as a cache for expensive intermediate results that are reused in such activities as cross-validation of machine learning algorithms. MOBBED is implemented over PostgreSQL, a widely used open source database, and is freely available under the GNU general public license at http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/mobbed.

We have developed a software program for creating a web-based integrative database and analysis platform called MANTA (Microbiota And pheNoType correlation Analysis platform). In addition to storing the data, MANTA is equipped with an intuitive user interface that can be used to correlate the microbial composition with phenotypic parameters. Using a case study, we demonstrated that MANTA was able to quickly identify the significant correlations between microbial abundances and phenotypes that are supported by previous studies.

22689643,MoNetFamily: a web server to infer homologous modules and module-module interaction networks in vertebrates.,"A module is a fundamental unit forming with highly connected proteins and performs a certain kind of biological functions. Modules and module-module interaction (MMI) network are essential for understanding cellular processes and functions. The MoNetFamily web server can identify the modules, homologous modules (called module family) and MMI networks across multiple species for the query protein(s). This server first finds module candidates of the query by using BLASTP to search the module template database (1785 experimental and 1252 structural templates). MoNetFamily then infers the homologous modules of the selected module candidate using protein-protein interaction (PPI) families. According to homologous modules and PPIs, we statistically calculated MMIs and MMI networks across multiple species. For each module candidate, MoNetFamily identifies its neighboring modules and their MMIs in module networks of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. Finally, MoNetFamily shows the conserved proteins, PPI profiles and functional annotations of the module family. Our results indicate that the server can be useful for MMI network (e.g. 1818 modules and 9678 MMIs in H. sapiens) visualizations and query annotations using module families and neighboring modules. We believe that the server is able to provide valuable insights to determine homologous modules and MMI networks across multiple species for studying module evolution and cellular processes.

Although IC4R offers ultra-high density rice variation map, these raw SNPs are not readily usable for the public. To satisfy different research utilizations of SNPs for population genetics, evolutionary analysis, association studies, and genomic breeding in rice, raw genotypic data of these 18 million SNPs were processed by unified bioinformatics pipelines.

26607947,SymbioGenomesDB: a database for the integration and access to knowledge on host-symbiont relationships.,"Symbiotic relationships occur naturally throughout the tree of life, either in a commensal, mutualistic or pathogenic manner. The genomes of multiple organisms involved in symbiosis are rapidly being sequenced and becoming available, especially those from the microbial world. Currently, there are numerous databases that offer information on specific organisms or models, but none offer a global understanding on relationships between organisms, their interactions and capabilities within their niche, as well as their role as part of a system, in this case, their role in symbiosis. We have developed the SymbioGenomesDB as a community database resource for laboratories which intend to investigate and use information on the genetics and the genomics of organisms involved in these relationships. The ultimate goal of SymbioGenomesDB is to host and support the growing and vast symbiotic-host relationship information, to uncover the genetic basis of such associations. SymbioGenomesDB maintains a comprehensive organization of information on genomes of symbionts from diverse hosts throughout the Tree of Life, including their sequences, their metadata and their genomic features. This catalog of relationships was generated using computational tools, custom R scripts and manual integration of data available in public literature. As a highly curated and comprehensive systems database, SymbioGenomesDB provides web access to all the information of symbiotic organisms, their features and links to the central database NCBI. Three different tools can be found within the database to explore symbiosis-related organisms, their genes and their genomes. Also, we offer an orthology search for one or multiple genes in one or multiple organisms within symbiotic relationships, and every table, graph and output file is downloadable and easy to parse for further analysis. The robust SymbioGenomesDB will be constantly updated to cope with all the data being generated and included in major databases, in order to serve as an important, useful and timesaving tool.

31995185,Refgenie: a reference genome resource manager.,"<h4>Background</h4>Reference genome assemblies are essential for high-throughput sequencing analysis projects. Typically, genome assemblies are stored on disk alongside related resources; e.g., many sequence aligners require the assembly to be indexed. The resulting indexes are broadly applicable for downstream analysis, so it makes sense to share them. However, there is no simple tool to do this.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce refgenie, a reference genome assembly asset manager. Refgenie makes it easier to organize, retrieve, and share genome analysis resources. In addition to genome indexes, refgenie can manage any files related to reference genomes, including sequences and annotation files. Refgenie includes a command line interface and a server application that provides a RESTful API, so it is useful for both tool development and analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Refgenie streamlines sharing genome analysis resources among groups and across computing environments.

27987180,Construction of the Leaf Senescence Database and Functional Assessment of Senescence-Associated Genes.,"Leaf senescence is the last phase of plant development and a highly coordinated process regulated by a large number of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). By broad literature survey, we constructed a leaf senescence database (LSD) in 2011 and updated it to Version 2.0 in 2014 ( http://www.eplantsenescence.org/ and http://psd.cbi.pku.edu.cn/ ) which contains a total of 5357 genes and 324 mutants from 44 species. These SAGs were retrieved based on genetic, genomic, proteomic, physiological, or other experimental evidence and were classified into different categories according to their functions in leaf senescence or morphological phenotype of mutants. To provide comprehensive information for SAGs, we made extensive annotation by both manual and computational approaches. In addition, we predicted putative orthologues of the SAGs in other species. LSD has a user-friendly interface to allow users to make text queries or BLAST searches and to download SAGs sequences for local analysis. Functional analyses of putative SAGs reveal that WRKY75, AZF2, NAC16, and WRKY26 are positive regulators of leaf senescence, while MKP2 and CTR1 perform negative regulation to leaf senescence.

24705205,HPVdb: a data mining system for knowledge discovery in human papillomavirus with applications in T cell immunology and vaccinology.,"High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causes of many cancers, including cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile and oropharyngeal. To facilitate diagnosis, prognosis and characterization of these cancers, it is necessary to make full use of the immunological data on HPV available through publications, technical reports and databases. These data vary in granularity, quality and complexity. The extraction of knowledge from the vast amount of immunological data using data mining techniques remains a challenging task. To support integration of data and knowledge in virology and vaccinology, we developed a framework called KB-builder to streamline the development and deployment of web-accessible immunological knowledge systems. The framework consists of seven major functional modules, each facilitating a specific aspect of the knowledgebase construction process. Using KB-builder, we constructed the Human Papillomavirus T cell Antigen Database (HPVdb). It contains 2781 curated antigen entries of antigenic proteins derived from 18 genotypes of high-risk HPV and 18 genotypes of low-risk HPV. The HPVdb also catalogs 191 verified T cell epitopes and 45 verified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. Primary amino acid sequences of HPV antigens were collected and annotated from the UniProtKB. T cell epitopes and HLA ligands were collected from data mining of scientific literature and databases. The data were subject to extensive quality control (redundancy elimination, error detection and vocabulary consolidation). A set of computational tools for an in-depth analysis, such as sequence comparison using BLAST search, multiple alignments of antigens, classification of HPV types based on cancer risk, T cell epitope/HLA ligand visualization, T cell epitope/HLA ligand conservation analysis and sequence variability analysis, has been integrated within the HPVdb. Predicted Class I and Class II HLA binding peptides for 15 common HLA alleles are included in this database as putative targets. HPVdb is a knowledge-based system that integrates curated data and information with tailored analysis tools to facilitate data mining for HPV vaccinology and immunology. To our best knowledge, HPVdb is a unique data source providing a comprehensive list of HPV antigens and peptides.

Even though numerous tools for primer design exist, the majority of resulting assays still requires extensive testing and optimisation or does not allow for high quality target amplification. We developed a workflow for designing qPCR assays. Unlike other tools, we compute a PCR assay including primer design, concentrations and the optimal PCR program.<h4>Results</h4>Gene expression assays were already generated in a total of 283,226 genes from three species and are continued for all genes of the major model species. The results are available online at https://pcrdrive.com/lab#/assay-database . The workflow involves filtering Primer3-generated primers by considering diverse parameters including specificity, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), secondary structure as well as compatibility with standard qPCR assay conditions. The resulting assays consist of transcript-specific primer sequences, a reagents protocol as well as instrument settings which are provided in a web-based tool called PCRdrive. PCRdrive was designed to support PCR users in their PCR-related tasks and is equipped with handy functions, components of an electronic lab notebook (ELN) as well as teamworking opportunities.<h4>Conclusion</h4>High quality ready to use qPCR assays for gene expression analysis are provided within the online platform PCRdrive. A built-in primer designer enables easy generation of assays which is not supported by any other tool. The wet lab optimisation of new assays can be transparently documented and shared within the team. PCRdrive also contains an archive of public PCRs which is updated regularly.

30668479,TargetDBP: Accurate DNA-Binding Protein Prediction Via Sequence-Based Multi-View Feature Learning.,"Accurately identifying DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) from protein sequence information is an important but challenging task for protein function annotations. In this paper, we establish a novel computational method, named TargetDBP, for accurately targeting DBPs from primary sequences. In TargetDBP, four single-view features, i.e., AAC (Amino Acid Composition), PsePSSM (Pseudo Position-Specific Scoring Matrix), PsePRSA (Pseudo Predicted Relative Solvent Accessibility), and PsePPDBS (Pseudo Predicted Probabilities of DNA-Binding Sites), are first extracted to represent different base features, respectively. Second, differential evolution algorithm is employed to learn the weights of four base features. Using the learned weights, we weightedly combine these base features to form the original super feature. An excellent subset of the super feature is then selected by using a suitable feature selection algorithm SVM-REF+CBR (Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination with Correlation Bias Reduction). Finally, the prediction model is learned via using support vector machine on the selected feature subset. We also construct a new gold-standard and non-redundant benchmark dataset from PDB database to evaluate and compare the proposed TargetDBP with other existing predictors. On this new dataset, TargetDBP can achieve higher performance than other state-of-the-art predictors.

23160411,"Developing a biocuration workflow for AgBase, a non-model organism database.","AgBase provides annotation for agricultural gene products using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Plant Ontology, as appropriate. Unlike model organism species, agricultural species have a body of literature that does not just focus on gene function; to improve efficiency, we use text mining to identify literature for curation. The first component of our annotation interface is the gene prioritization interface that ranks gene products for annotation. Biocurators select the top-ranked gene and mark annotation for these genes as 'in progress' or 'completed'; links enable biocurators to move directly to our biocuration interface (BI). Our BI includes all current GO annotation for gene products and is the main interface to add/modify AgBase curation data. The BI also displays Extracting Genic Information from Text (eGIFT) results for each gene product. eGIFT is a web-based, text-mining tool that associates ranked, informative terms (iTerms) and the articles and sentences containing them, with genes. Moreover, iTerms are linked to GO terms, where they match either a GO term name or a synonym. This enables AgBase biocurators to rapidly identify literature for further curation based on possible GO terms. Because most agricultural species do not have standardized literature, eGIFT searches all gene names and synonyms to associate articles with genes. As many of the gene names can be ambiguous, eGIFT applies a disambiguation step to remove matches that do not correspond to this gene, and filtering is applied to remove abstracts that mention a gene in passing. The BI is linked to our Journal Database (JDB) where corresponding journal citations are stored. Just as importantly, biocurators also add to the JDB citations that have no GO annotation. The AgBase BI also supports bulk annotation upload to facilitate our Inferred from electronic annotation of agricultural gene products.

31851420,NCBI's Conserved Domain Database and Tools for Protein Domain Analysis.,"The Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is a freely available resource for the annotation of sequences with the locations of conserved protein domain footprints, as well as functional sites and motifs inferred from these footprints. It includes protein domain and protein family models curated in house by CDD staff, as well as imported from a variety of other sources. The latest CDD release (v3.17, April 2019) contains more than 57,000 domain models, of which almost 15,000 were curated by CDD staff. The CDD curation effort increases coverage and provides finer-grained classifications of common and widely distributed protein domain families, for which a wealth of functional and structural data have become available. The CDD maintains both live search capabilities and an archive of pre-computed domain annotations for a selected subset of sequences tracked by the NCBI's Entrez protein database. These can be retrieved or computed for a single sequence using CD-Search or in bulk using Batch CD-Search, or computed via standalone RPS-BLAST plus the rpsbproc software package.

25518851,PROGgeneV2: enhancements on the existing database.,"<h4>Background</h4>We recently published PROGgene, a tool that can be used to study prognostic implications of genes in various cancers. The first version of the tool had several areas for improvement. In this paper we present some major enhancements we have made on the existing tool in the new version, PROGgeneV2.<h4>Results</h4>In PROGgeneV2, we have made several modifications to enhance survival analysis capability of the tool. First, we have increased the repository of public studies catalogued in our tool by almost two folds. We have also added additional functionalities to perform survival analysis in a variety of new ways. Survival analysis can now be performed on a) single genes b) multiple genes as a signature, c) ratio of expression of two genes, and d) curated/published gene signatures in new version. Users can now also adjust the survival analysis models for available covariates. Users can study prognostic implications of entire gene signatures in different cancer types, which are searchable by keywords. Also, unique to our tool, in the new version, users will be able to upload and use their own datasets to perform survival analysis on genes of interest.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We believe, like its predecessor, PROGGeneV2 will continue to be useful for the scientific community for formulating research hypotheses and designing mechanistic studies. With added datasets PROGgeneV2 is the most comprehensive survival analysis tool available.

21423752,"HMMerThread: detecting remote, functional conserved domains in entire genomes by combining relaxed sequence-database searches with fold recognition.","Conserved domains in proteins are one of the major sources of functional information for experimental design and genome-level annotation. Though search tools for conserved domain databases such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are sensitive in detecting conserved domains in proteins when they share sufficient sequence similarity, they tend to miss more divergent family members, as they lack a reliable statistical framework for the detection of low sequence similarity. We have developed a greatly improved HMMerThread algorithm that can detect remotely conserved domains in highly divergent sequences. HMMerThread combines relaxed conserved domain searches with fold recognition to eliminate false positive, sequence-based identifications. With an accuracy of 90%, our software is able to automatically predict highly divergent members of conserved domain families with an associated 3-dimensional structure. We give additional confidence to our predictions by validation across species. We have run HMMerThread searches on eight proteomes including human and present a rich resource of remotely conserved domains, which adds significantly to the functional annotation of entire proteomes. We find ∼4500 cross-species validated, remotely conserved domain predictions in the human proteome alone. As an example, we find a DNA-binding domain in the C-terminal part of the A-kinase anchor protein 10 (AKAP10), a PKA adaptor that has been implicated in cardiac arrhythmias and premature cardiac death, which upon stress likely translocates from mitochondria to the nucleus/nucleolus. Based on our prediction, we propose that with this HLH-domain, AKAP10 is involved in the transcriptional control of stress response. Further remotely conserved domains we discuss are examples from areas such as sporulation, chromosome segregation and signalling during immune response. The HMMerThread algorithm is able to automatically detect the presence of remotely conserved domains in proteins based on weak sequence similarity. Our predictions open up new avenues for biological and medical studies.

24247530,Addition of a breeding database in the Genome Database for Rosaceae.,"Breeding programs produce large datasets that require efficient management systems to keep track of performance, pedigree, geographical and image-based data. With the development of DNA-based screening technologies, more breeding programs perform genotyping in addition to phenotyping for performance evaluation. The integration of breeding data with other genomic and genetic data is instrumental for the refinement of marker-assisted breeding tools, enhances genetic understanding of important crop traits and maximizes access and utility by crop breeders and allied scientists. Development of new infrastructure in the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) was designed and implemented to enable secure and efficient storage, management and analysis of large datasets from the Washington State University apple breeding program and subsequently expanded to fit datasets from other Rosaceae breeders. The infrastructure was built using the software Chado and Drupal, making use of the Natural Diversity module to accommodate large-scale phenotypic and genotypic data. Breeders can search accessions within the GDR to identify individuals with specific trait combinations. Results from Search by Parentage lists individuals with parents in common and results from Individual Variety pages link to all data available on each chosen individual including pedigree, phenotypic and genotypic information. Genotypic data are searchable by markers and alleles; results are linked to other pages in the GDR to enable the user to access tools such as GBrowse and CMap. This breeding database provides users with the opportunity to search datasets in a fully targeted manner and retrieve and compare performance data from multiple selections, years and sites, and to output the data needed for variety release publications and patent applications. The breeding database facilitates efficient program management.

As the number of available protein structures increases, structural alignment based algorithm becomes the dominant approach for protein-binding sites prediction. However, the present algorithms underutilize the ever increasing numbers of three-dimensional protein-ligand complex structures (bound protein), and it could be improved on the process of alignment, selection of templates and clustering of template. Herein, we built so far the largest database of bound templates with stringent quality control. And on this basis, bSiteFinder as a protein-binding sites prediction server was developed.<h4>Results</h4>By introducing Homology Indexing, Chain Length Indexing, Stability of Complex and Optimized Multiple-Templates Clustering into our algorithm, the efficiency of our server has been significantly improved. Further, the accuracy was approximately 2-10 % higher than that of other algorithms for the test with either bound dataset or unbound dataset. For 210 bound dataset, bSiteFinder achieved high accuracies up to 94.8 % (MCC 0.95). For another 48 bound/unbound dataset, bSiteFinder achieved high accuracies up to 93.8 % for bound proteins (MCC 0.95) and 85.4 % for unbound proteins (MCC 0.72).

23110975,Manual Gene Ontology annotation workflow at the Mouse Genome Informatics Database.,"The Mouse Genome Database, the Gene Expression Database and the Mouse Tumor Biology database are integrated components of the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource (http://www.informatics.jax.org). The MGI system presents both a consensus view and an experimental view of the knowledge concerning the genetics and genomics of the laboratory mouse. From genotype to phenotype, this information resource integrates information about genes, sequences, maps, expression analyses, alleles, strains and mutant phenotypes. Comparative mammalian data are also presented particularly in regards to the use of the mouse as a model for the investigation of molecular and genetic components of human diseases. These data are collected from literature curation as well as downloads of large datasets (SwissProt, LocusLink, etc.). MGI is one of the founding members of the Gene Ontology (GO) and uses the GO for functional annotation of genes. Here, we discuss the workflow associated with manual GO annotation at MGI, from literature collection to display of the annotations. Peer-reviewed literature is collected mostly from a set of journals available electronically. Selected articles are entered into a master bibliography and indexed to one of eight areas of interest such as 'GO' or 'homology' or 'phenotype'. Each article is then either indexed to a gene already contained in the database or funneled through a separate nomenclature database to add genes. The master bibliography and associated indexing provide information for various curator-reports such as 'papers selected for GO that refer to genes with NO GO annotation'. Once indexed, curators who have expertise in appropriate disciplines enter pertinent information. MGI makes use of several controlled vocabularies that ensure uniform data encoding, enable robust analysis and support the construction of complex queries. These vocabularies range from pick-lists to structured vocabularies such as the GO.

30903182,PedigreeNet: a web-based pedigree viewer for biological databases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Plant breeding aims to improve current germplasm that can tolerate a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. To accomplish this goal, breeders rely on developing a deeper understanding of genetic makeup and relationships between plant varieties to make informed plant selections. Although rapid advances in genotyping technology generated a large amount of data for breeders, tools that facilitate pedigree analysis and visualization are scant, leaving breeders to use classical, but inherently limited, hierarchical pedigree diagrams for a handful of plant varieties. To answer this need, we developed a simple web-based tool that can be easily implemented at biological databases, called PedigreeNet, to create and visualize customizable pedigree relationships in a network context, displaying pre- and user-uploaded data.<h4>Results</h4>As a proof-of-concept, we implemented PedigreeNet at the maize model organism database, MaizeGDB. The PedigreeNet viewer at MaizeGDB has a dynamically-generated pedigree network of 4706 maize lines and 5487 relationships that are currently available as both a stand-alone web-based tool and integrated directly on the MaizeGDB Stock Pages. The tool allows the user to apply a number of filters, select or upload their own breeding relationships, center a pedigree network on a plant variety, identify the common ancestor between two varieties, and display the shortest path(s) between two varieties on the pedigree network. The PedigreeNet code layer is written as a JavaScript wrapper around Cytoscape Web. PedigreeNet fills a great need for breeders to have access to an online tool to represent and visually customize pedigree relationships.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PedigreeNet is accessible at https://www.maizegdb.org/breeders_toolbox.

Recent studies suggest that RNA modifications play versatile roles in essential biological mechanisms, and are closely related to the progression of various diseases including multiple cancers. To comprehensively unveil the association between disease-associated variants and their epitranscriptome disturbance, we built RMDisease, a database of genetic variants that can affect RNA modifications. By integrating the prediction results of 18 different RNA modification prediction tools and also 303,426 experimentally-validated RNA modification sites, RMDisease identified a total of 202,307 human SNPs that may affect (add or remove) sites of eight types of RNA modifications (m6A, m5C, m1A, m5U, Ψ, m6Am, m7G and Nm). These include 4,289 disease-associated variants that may imply disease pathogenesis functioning at the epitranscriptome layer. These SNPs were further annotated with essential information such as post-transcriptional regulations (sites for miRNA binding, interaction with RNA-binding proteins and alternative splicing) revealing putative regulatory circuits. A convenient graphical user interface was constructed to support the query, exploration and download of the relevant information.

To make genome-wide transcriptome data easily accessible, we developed the Glia Open Access Database (GOAD), available via www.goad.education. GOAD contains a collection of previously published and unpublished transcriptome data, including datasets from isolated microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes both at homeostatic and pathological conditions. It contains an intuitive web-based interface that consists of three features that enable searching, browsing, analyzing, and downloading of the data. The first feature is differential gene expression (DE) analysis that provides genes that are significantly up and down-regulated with the associated fold changes and p-values between two conditions of interest. In addition, an interactive Venn diagram is generated to illustrate the overlap and differences between several DE gene lists. The second feature is quantitative gene expression (QE) analysis, to investigate which genes are expressed in a particular glial cell type and to what degree. The third feature is a search utility, which can be used to find a gene of interest and depict its expression in all available expression data sets by generating a gene card. In addition, quality guidelines and relevant concepts for transcriptome analysis are discussed. Finally, GOAD is discussed in relation to several online transcriptome tools developed in neuroscience and immunology.

In particular, this approach allows investigators to (1) reconstruct and ""resurrect"" (that is, synthesize in vivo or in vitro) extinct proteins to study how they differ from modern proteins, (2) identify key amino acid changes that, over evolutionary timescales, have altered the function of the protein, and (3) order historical events in the evolution of protein function. Widespread use of this approach has been slow among molecular biologists, in part because the methods require significant computational expertise.

22857267,MicrobesFlux: a web platform for drafting metabolic models from the KEGG database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Concurrent with the efforts currently underway in mapping microbial genomes using high-throughput sequencing methods, systems biologists are building metabolic models to characterize and predict cell metabolisms. One of the key steps in building a metabolic model is using multiple databases to collect and assemble essential information about genome-annotations and the architecture of the metabolic network for a specific organism. To speed up metabolic model development for a large number of microorganisms, we need a user-friendly platform to construct metabolic networks and to perform constraint-based flux balance analysis based on genome databases and experimental results.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a semi-automatic, web-based platform (MicrobesFlux) for generating and reconstructing metabolic models for annotated microorganisms. MicrobesFlux is able to automatically download the metabolic network (including enzymatic reactions and metabolites) of ~1,200 species from the KEGG database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and then convert it to a metabolic model draft. The platform also provides diverse customized tools, such as gene knockouts and the introduction of heterologous pathways, for users to reconstruct the model network. The reconstructed metabolic network can be formulated to a constraint-based flux model to predict and analyze the carbon fluxes in microbial metabolisms. The simulation results can be exported in the SBML format (The Systems Biology Markup Language). Furthermore, we also demonstrated the platform functionalities by developing an FBA model (including 229 reactions) for a recent annotated bioethanol producer, Thermoanaerobacter sp. strain X514, to predict its biomass growth and ethanol production.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MicrobesFlux is an installation-free and open-source platform that enables biologists without prior programming knowledge to develop metabolic models for annotated microorganisms in the KEGG database. Our system facilitates users to reconstruct metabolic networks of organisms based on experimental information. Through human-computer interaction, MicrobesFlux provides users with reasonable predictions of microbial metabolism via flux balance analysis.

To reveal the biological functions of protein-linked glycans involved in numerous biological processes, the high-throughput identification of both glycoproteins and the attached glycan structures becomes fundamentally important. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is an effective method for glycoproteomic analysis because of its high sensitivity and selectivity. Two experimental approaches exist to obtain MS/MS spectral data of glycopeptides. One consists of isolating glycans from glycopeptides and generating MS/MS spectra of the glycans and peptides separately. The other approach produces spectra directly from intact glycopeptides. The latter approach has the advantage of retaining the glycosylation site information. However, the spectral data cannot be readily analyzed because of the lack of software specifically designed for the identification of intact glycopeptides. To address this need, we developed a novel software tool, GlycoMaster DB, to assist the automated and high-throughput identification of intact N-linked glycopeptides from MS/MS spectra. The software simultaneously searches a protein sequence database and a glycan structure database to find the best pair of peptide and glycan for each input spectrum. GlycoMaster DB can analyze mass spectral data produced with HCD/ETD mixed fragmentation, where HCD spectra are used to identify glycans and ETD spectra are used to determine peptide sequences. When only HCD spectra are available, GlycoMaster DB can still help to identify the glycans, and a list of possible peptide sequences are reported according to the accurate precursor mass and the N-linked glycopeptide sequon.

27319297,ORION: a web server for protein fold recognition and structure prediction using evolutionary hybrid profiles.,"Protein structure prediction based on comparative modeling is the most efficient way to produce structural models when it can be performed. ORION is a dedicated webserver based on a new strategy that performs this task. The identification by ORION of suitable templates is performed using an original profile-profile approach that combines sequence and structure evolution information. Structure evolution information is encoded into profiles using structural features, such as solvent accessibility and local conformation -with Protein Blocks-, which give an accurate description of the local protein structure. ORION has recently been improved, increasing by 5% the quality of its results. The ORION web server accepts a single protein sequence as input and searches homologous protein structures within minutes. Various databases such as PDB, SCOP and HOMSTRAD can be mined to find an appropriate structural template. For the modeling step, a protein 3D structure can be directly obtained from the selected template by MODELLER and displayed with global and local quality model estimation measures. The sequence and the predicted structure of 4 examples from the CAMEO server and a recent CASP11 target from the 'Hard' category (T0818-D1) are shown as pertinent examples.

Understanding cross-talks between the two regulators and their targets is critical to reveal complex molecular regulatory mechanisms. Here, we developed FFLtool, a web server for detecting potential feed forward loop (FFL) of TF-miRNA-target regulation in human. In FFLtool, we integrated comprehensive regulations of TF-target and miRNA-target, and developed two functional modules: (i) The 'FFL Analysis' module can detect potential FFLs and internal regulatory networks in a user-defined gene set. FFLtool also provides three levels of evidence to illustrate the reliability for each FFL and enrichment functions for co-target genes of the same TF and miRNA; (ii) The 'Browse FFLs' module displays FFLs comprised of differentially or specifically expressed TFs and miRNAs and their target genes in cancers.

Important data are compiled, including bacteriocin name, class, amino acids and nucleic acid sequences, if available. Target microorganisms, origin, status of the producing strains and their culture conditions and extraction and purification methods are also included in this new database. A phylogenetic tree for the mature peptide bacteriocin sequences has also been created. LABiocin is an interactive database with a user-friendly interface that integrates several tools and services and comprises up to 517 LAB bacteriocins. Besides data searching tools, a BLAST tool was integrated into the database to enable the user to perform a homology search against mature peptide sequences. Users can be linked to other databases that contain additional information, particularly about predicted bacteriocin structure and mechanisms of action.

Chemotheca: A Community-Populated Molecular Database for Multi-Target Ligands Identification and Compound-Repurposing.,"For every lead compound developed in medicinal chemistry research, numerous other inactive or less active candidates are synthetized/isolated and tested. The majority of these compounds will not be selected for further development due to a sub-optimal pharmacological profile. However, some poorly active or even inactive compounds could live a second life if tested against other targets. Thus, new therapeutic opportunities could emerge and synergistic activities could be identified and exploited for existing compounds by sharing information between researchers who are working on different targets. The Mu.Ta.Lig (Multi-Target Ligand) Chemotheca database aims to offer such opportunities by facilitating information exchange among researchers worldwide. After a preliminary registration, users can (a) virtually upload structures and activity data for their compounds with corresponding, and eventually known activity data, and (b) search for other available compounds uploaded by the users community. Each piece of information about given compounds is owned by the user who initially uploaded it and multiple ownership is possible (this occurs if different users uploaded the same compounds or information pertaining to the same compounds). A web-based graphical user interface has been developed to assist compound uploading, compounds searching and data retrieval. Physico-chemical and ADME properties as well as substructure-based PAINS evaluations are computed on the fly for each uploaded compound. Samples of compounds that match a set of search criteria and additional data on these compounds could be requested directly from their owners with no mediation by the Mu.Ta.Lig Chemotheca team.

29688366,BioDataome: a collection of uniformly preprocessed and automatically annotated datasets for data-driven biology.,"Biotechnology revolution generates a plethora of omics data with an exponential growth pace. Therefore, biological data mining demands automatic, 'high quality' curation efforts to organize biomedical knowledge into online databases. BioDataome is a database of uniformly preprocessed and disease-annotated omics data with the aim to promote and accelerate the reuse of public data. We followed the same preprocessing pipeline for each biological mart (microarray gene expression, RNA-Seq gene expression and DNA methylation) to produce ready for downstream analysis datasets and automatically annotated them with disease-ontology terms. We also designate datasets that share common samples and automatically discover control samples in case-control studies. Currently, BioDataome includes ∼5600 datasets, ∼260 000 samples spanning ∼500 diseases and can be easily used in large-scale massive experiments and meta-analysis. All datasets are publicly available for querying and downloading via BioDataome web application. We demonstrate BioDataome's utility by presenting exploratory data analysis examples.

31477007,SalMotifDB: a tool for analyzing putative transcription factor binding sites in salmonid genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recently developed genome resources in Salmonid fish provides tools for studying the genomics underlying a wide range of properties including life history trait variation in the wild, economically important traits in aquaculture and the evolutionary consequences of whole genome duplications. Although genome assemblies now exist for a number of salmonid species, the lack of regulatory annotations are holding back our mechanistic understanding of how genetic variation in non-coding regulatory regions affect gene expression and the downstream phenotypic effects.<h4>Results</h4>We present SalMotifDB, a database and associated web and R interface for the analysis of transcription factors (TFs) and their cis-regulatory binding sites in five salmonid genomes. SalMotifDB integrates TF-binding site information for 3072 non-redundant DNA patterns (motifs) assembled from a large number of metazoan motif databases. Through motif matching and TF prediction, we have used these multi-species databases to construct putative regulatory networks in salmonid species. The utility of SalMotifDB is demonstrated by showing that key lipid metabolism regulators are predicted to regulate a set of genes affected by different lipid and fatty acid content in the feed, and by showing that our motif database explains a significant proportion of gene expression divergence in gene duplicates originating from the salmonid specific whole genome duplication.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SalMotifDB is an effective tool for analyzing transcription factors, their binding sites and the resulting gene regulatory networks in salmonid species, and will be an important tool for gaining a better mechanistic understanding of gene regulation and the associated phenotypes in salmonids.

24091140,Fast automated protein NMR data collection and assignment by ADAPT-NMR on Bruker spectrometers.,"ADAPT-NMR (Assignment-directed Data collection Algorithm utilizing a Probabilistic Toolkit in NMR) supports automated NMR data collection and backbone and side chain assignment for [U-(13)C, U-(15)N]-labeled proteins. Given the sequence of the protein and data for the orthogonal 2D (1)H-(15)N and (1)H-(13)C planes, the algorithm automatically directs the collection of tilted plane data from a variety of triple-resonance experiments so as to follow an efficient pathway toward the probabilistic assignment of (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N signals to specific atoms in the covalent structure of the protein. Data collection and assignment calculations continue until the addition of new data no longer improves the assignment score. ADAPT-NMR was first implemented on Varian (Agilent) spectrometers [A. Bahrami, M. Tonelli, S.C. Sahu, K.K. Singarapu, H.R. Eghbalnia, J.L. Markley, PLoS One 7 (2012) e33173]. Because of broader interest in the approach, we present here a version of ADAPT-NMR for Bruker spectrometers. We have developed two AU console programs (ADAPT_ORTHO_run and ADAPT_NMR_run) that run under TOPSPIN Versions 3.0 and higher. To illustrate the performance of the algorithm on a Bruker spectrometer, we tested one protein, chlorella ubiquitin (76 amino acid residues), that had been used with the Varian version: the Bruker and Varian versions achieved the same level of assignment completeness (98% in 20 h). As a more rigorous evaluation of the Bruker version, we tested a larger protein, BRPF1 bromodomain (114 amino acid residues), which yielded an automated assignment completeness of 86% in 55 h. Both experiments were carried out on a 500 MHz Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm TCI probe.

24022982,LTMap: a web server for assessing the potential liver toxicity by genome-wide transcriptional expression data.,"Toxicogenomics (TGx) has played a significant role in mechanistic research related with hepatotoxicity as well as liver toxicity prediction. Currently, several large-scale preclinical TGx data sets were made freely accessible to the public, such as Open TG-GATEs. With the availability of a sufficient amount of microarray data, it is important to integrate this information to provide new insights into the risk assessment of potential drug-induced liver toxicity. Here we developed a web server for evaluating the potential liver toxicity based on genome-wide transcriptomics data, namely LTMap. In LTMap, researchers could compare signatures of query compounds against a pregenerated signature database of 20 123 Affymetrix arrays associated with about 170 compounds retrieved from the largest public toxicogenomics data set Open TG-GATEs. Results from this comparison may lead to the unexpected discovery of similar toxicological responses between chemicals. We validated our computational approach for similarity comparison using three example drugs. Our successful applications of LTMap in these case studies demonstrated its utility in revealing the connection of chemicals according to similar toxicological behaviors.

Bisulfite sequencing enables profiling of mouse developmental methylomes on an unprecedented scale; however, integrating and mining these data are challenges for experimental biologists. Therefore, we developed DevMouse, which focuses on the efficient storage of DNA methylomes in temporal order and quantitative analysis of methylation dynamics during mouse development. The latest release of DevMouse incorporates 32 normalized and temporally ordered methylomes across 15 developmental stages and related genome information. A flexible query engine is developed for acquisition of methylation profiles for genes, microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and genomic intervals of interest across selected developmental stages. To facilitate in-depth mining of these profiles, DevMouse offers online analysis tools for the quantification of methylation variation, identification of differentially methylated genes, hierarchical clustering, gene function annotation and enrichment.

30719103,RepetDB: a unified resource for transposable element references.,"<h4>Background</h4>Thanks to their ability to move around and replicate within genomes, transposable elements (TEs) are perhaps the most important contributors to genome plasticity and evolution. Their detection and annotation are considered essential in any genome sequencing project. The number of fully sequenced genomes is rapidly increasing with improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies. A fully automated de novo annotation process for TEs is therefore required to cope with the deluge of sequence data.However, all automated procedures are error-prone, and an automated procedure for TE identification and classification would be no exception. It is therefore crucial to provide not only the TE reference sequences, but also evidence justifying their classification, at the scale of the whole genome. A few TE databases already exist, but none provides evidence to justify TE classification. Moreover, biological information about the sequences remains globally poor.<h4>Results</h4>We present here the RepetDB database developed in the framework of GnpIS, a genetic and genomic information system. RepetDB is designed to store and retrieve detected, classified and annotated TEs in a standardized manner. RepetDB is an implementation with extensions of InterMine, an open-source data warehouse framework used here to store, search, browse, analyze and compare all the data recorded for each TE reference sequence. InterMine can display diverse information for each sequence and allows simple to very complex queries. Finally, TE data are displayed via a worldwide data discovery portal. RepetDB is accessible at urgi.versailles.inra.fr/repetdb.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RepetDB is designed to be a TE knowledge base populated with full de novo TE annotations of complete (or near-complete) genome sequences. Indeed, the description and classification of TEs facilitates the exploration of specific TE families, superfamilies or orders across a large range of species.

29280990,DPMIND: degradome-based plant miRNA-target interaction and network database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and stress responses through post-transcriptionally regulating the expression levels of their target mRNAs. Although some tools and databases were developed for predicting the relationships between miRNAs and their targets (miR-Tar), most of them were dependent on computational methods without experimental validations. With the development of degradome sequencing techniques, researchers can identify potential interactions based on degradome sequencing data. The validations with specific degradome data are useful to identify the miR-Tar interactions (MTIs) occurring in/under some specific tissues or treatments. Degradome-based plant miRNA-target interaction and network database (DPMIND) collected almost all available plant degradome data and built a retrieval and analysis platform of miRNA-target interactions and miRNA regulatory networks (MRNs).<h4>Results</h4>DPMIND contains the recently updated 3794 miRNAs and 28 666 verified MTIs with 69 degradomes from 10 plant species. Not only the verified MTIs but also the degradome-based MRNs can be retrieved from DPMIND. Users can search for the verified MTIs and build degradome-based MRNs for the specific miRNAs or targets. DPMIND can build the MRNs based on all degradomes or specific degradomes, which helps to identify all possible connections among specific miR-Tar and compare the miRNA-mediated networks among various tissues or treatments. It can also build the networks mediated by all known miRNAs based on specific degradomes. Furthermore, DPMIND can be used to study the conservation and specificity of MTIs and sub-networks across different plant tissues or species.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://202.195.246.60/DPMIND/.<h4>Contact</h4>huangji@njau.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,4.0,,,dpmind,20.9960533,ok,,degradome | database,pmind,v2,0.9960533,DPMIND,True,True,True,,http://202.195.246.60/DPMIND/,http://202.195.246.60/DPMIND/,True,...r species.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://202.195.246.60/DPMIND/.<h4>Contact</h4>huangji@njau.edu.cn.<h4>Supplemen...,1

Increasingly, specimen data records become available in virtual herbaria and data portals. The traditional (physical) annotation procedure fails here, so that an important pathway of research documentation and data quality control is broken. In order to create an online annotation system, we analysed, modeled and adapted traditional specimen annotation workflows. The AnnoSys system accesses collection data from either conventional web resources or the Biological Collection Access Service (BioCASe) and accepts XML-based data standards like ABCD or DarwinCore. It comprises a searchable annotation data repository, a user interface, and a subscription based message system. We describe the main components of AnnoSys and its current and planned interoperability with biodiversity data portals and networks. Details are given on the underlying architectural model, which implements the W3C OpenAnnotation model and allows the adaptation of AnnoSys to different problem domains.

This procedure efficiently distinguishes clusters of functional non-coding elements in bacteria, particularly small RNAs and cis-regulatory RNAs, from other conserved sequences. In contrast to other non-coding RNA detection pipelines, NAPP does not require the presence of conserved RNA secondary structure and therefore is likely to identify previously undetected RNA genes or elements. Furthermore, as NAPP clusters contain both coding and non-coding sequences with similar occurrence profiles, they can be analyzed under a functional perspective. We recently improved the NAPP pipeline and applied it to a collection of 949 bacterial and 68 archaeal species.

Improvements include ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the least common ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine METATRYP database with predicted proteomes from environmental sequencing confirms a low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed to facilitate ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic.

30052770,MR4Cancer: a web server prioritizing master regulators for cancer.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>During cancer stage transition, a master regulator (MR) refers to the key gene controlling cancer initiation and progression by orchestrating the associated target genes (termed as its regulon). Due to their inherent importance, MRs can serve as critical biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and therapeutic targets. However, it is challenging to infer key MRs that might explain gene expression profile changes between two groups due to lack of context-specific regulons, whose expression level can collectively reflect the activity of likely MRs. There is also a need to design an easy-to-use tool of MR identification for research community.<h4>Results</h4>First, we generated cancer-specific regulons for 26 cancer types by analyzing high-throughput omics data from TCGA, and extracted noncancer-specific regulons from public databases. We subsequently developed a web server MR4Cancer, integrating the regulons with statistical inference to identify and prioritize MRs driving a phenotypic divergence of interest. Based on the input gene list (e.g. differentially expressed genes) or expression profile with two groups, MR4Cancer outputs ranked MRs by enrichment testing against the predefined regulons. Gene Ontology and canonical pathway analyses are also conducted to elucidate the function of likely MRs. Moreover, MR4Cancer provides dynamic network visualization for MR-target relations, and users can interactively interrogate the network to produce new hypotheses and high-quality figures for publication. Finally, the presented case studies highlighted the performance of MR4Cancer. We expect this user-friendly and powerful web tool will provide researchers novel insights into tumorigenesis and therapeutic intervention.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://cis.hku.hk/MR4Cancer.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,7.0,,mr4cancer,,20.9950696,ok,,,tcga,v2,0.9950696,MR4Cancer,True,True,True,,http://cis.hku.hk/MR4Cancer,http://cis.hku.hk/MR4Cancer,True,...ervention.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://cis.hku.hk/MR4Cancer.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
23145153,CREST--classification resources for environmental sequence tags.,"Sequencing of taxonomic or phylogenetic markers is becoming a fast and efficient method for studying environmental microbial communities. This has resulted in a steadily growing collection of marker sequences, most notably of the small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene, and an increased understanding of microbial phylogeny, diversity and community composition patterns. However, to utilize these large datasets together with new sequencing technologies, a reliable and flexible system for taxonomic classification is critical. We developed CREST (Classification Resources for Environmental Sequence Tags), a set of resources and tools for generating and utilizing custom taxonomies and reference datasets for classification of environmental sequences. CREST uses an alignment-based classification method with the lowest common ancestor algorithm. It also uses explicit rank similarity criteria to reduce false positives and identify novel taxa. We implemented this method in a web server, a command line tool and the graphical user interfaced program MEGAN. Further, we provide the SSU rRNA reference database and taxonomy SilvaMod, derived from the publicly available SILVA SSURef, for classification of sequences from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Using cross-validation and environmental datasets, we compared the performance of CREST and SilvaMod to the RDP Classifier. We also utilized Greengenes as a reference database, both with CREST and the RDP Classifier. These analyses indicate that CREST performs better than alignment-free methods with higher recall rate (sensitivity) as well as precision, and with the ability to accurately identify most sequences from novel taxa. Classification using SilvaMod performed better than with Greengenes, particularly when applied to environmental sequences.

29796670,HotSpot Wizard 3.0: web server for automated design of mutations and smart libraries based on sequence input information.,"HotSpot Wizard is a web server used for the automated identification of hotspots in semi-rational protein design to give improved protein stability, catalytic activity, substrate specificity and enantioselectivity. Since there are three orders of magnitude fewer protein structures than sequences in bioinformatic databases, the major limitation to the usability of previous versions was the requirement for the protein structure to be a compulsory input for the calculation. HotSpot Wizard 3.0 now accepts the protein sequence as input data. The protein structure for the query sequence is obtained either from eight repositories of homology models or is modeled using Modeller and I-Tasser. The quality of the models is then evaluated using three quality assessment tools-WHAT_CHECK, PROCHECK and MolProbity. During follow-up analyses, the system automatically warns the users whenever they attempt to redesign poorly predicted parts of their homology models. The second main limitation of HotSpot Wizard's predictions is that it identifies suitable positions for mutagenesis, but does not provide any reliable advice on particular substitutions. A new module for the estimation of thermodynamic stabilities using the Rosetta and FoldX suites has been introduced which prevents destabilizing mutations among pre-selected variants entering experimental testing.

31081035,LOMETS2: improved meta-threading server for fold-recognition and structure-based function annotation for distant-homology proteins.,"The LOMETS2 server (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/LOMETS/) is an online meta-threading server system for template-based protein structure prediction. Although the server has been widely used by the community over the last decade, the previous LOMETS server no longer represents the state-of-the-art due to aging of the algorithms and unsatisfactory performance on distant-homology template identification. An extension of the server built on cutting-edge methods, especially techniques developed since the recent CASP experiments, is urgently needed. In this work, we report the recent advancements of the LOMETS2 server, which comprise a number of major new developments, including (i) new state-of-the-art threading programs, including contact-map-based threading approaches, (ii) deep sequence search-based sequence profile construction and (iii) a new web interface design that incorporates structure-based function annotations. Large-scale benchmark tests demonstrated that the integration of the deep profiles and new threading approaches into LOMETS2 significantly improve its structure modeling quality and template detection, where LOMETS2 detected 176% more templates with TM-scores >0.5 than the previous LOMETS server for Hard targets that lacked homologous templates.

The CS-MINER is the abstract abbreviation for Chemical Space Miner and correlates the medicinal target space and chemical space, in a systematic way. The database in this software consists of a large collection of drug-like molecules. To prepare this database, a large number of molecules for 110 important biological targets were collected from Binding-DB. A total of 1497 physicochemical properties were calculated for each molecule. The CS-MINER uses the discriminant analysis techniques for tracing the collected data and finally separates the molecules based on their therapeutic targets and activities. The developed multivariate classifiers can be used for ligand-based virtual screening of more than 0.5 million random molecules of PubChem and ZINC databases. In order to validate the models, selected subspaces in CS-MINER were compared with DrugBank molecules. At the end of the analysis, the software provides an interactive environment for visualization of the selected chemical subspaces in the form of 2- and 3-dimensional plots.

33381797,ChemGenerator: a web server for generating potential ligands for specific targets.,"In drug discovery, one of the most important tasks is to find novel and biologically active molecules. Given that only a tip of iceberg of drugs was founded in nearly one-century's experimental exploration, it shows great significance to use in silico methods to expand chemical database and profile drug-target linkages. In this study, a web server named ChemGenerator was proposed to generate novel activates for specific targets based on users' input. The ChemGenerator relies on an autoencoder-based algorithm of Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory by training of 7 million of molecular Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System as the basic model, and further develops target guided generation by transfer learning. As results, ChemGenerator gains lower loss (<0.01) than existing reference model (0.2~0.4) and shows good performance in the case of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.

25547242,WEBnm@ v2.0: Web server and services for comparing protein flexibility.,"<h4>Background</h4>Normal mode analysis (NMA) using elastic network models is a reliable and cost-effective computational method to characterise protein flexibility and by extension, their dynamics. Further insight into the dynamics-function relationship can be gained by comparing protein motions between protein homologs and functional classifications. This can be achieved by comparing normal modes obtained from sets of evolutionary related proteins.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an automated tool for comparative NMA of a set of pre-aligned protein structures. The user can submit a sequence alignment in the FASTA format and the corresponding coordinate files in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. The computed normalised squared atomic fluctuations and atomic deformation energies of the submitted structures can be easily compared on graphs provided by the web user interface. The web server provides pairwise comparison of the dynamics of all proteins included in the submitted set using two measures: the Root Mean Squared Inner Product and the Bhattacharyya Coefficient. The Comparative Analysis has been implemented on our web server for NMA, WEBnm@, which also provides recently upgraded functionality for NMA of single protein structures. This includes new visualisations of protein motion, visualisation of inter-residue correlations and the analysis of conformational change using the overlap analysis. In addition, programmatic access to WEBnm@ is now available through a SOAP-based web service. Webnm@ is available at http://apps.cbu.uib.no/webnma .<h4>Conclusion</h4>WEBnm@ v2.0 is an online tool offering unique capability for comparative NMA on multiple protein structures.

26163692,C-It-Loci: a knowledge database for tissue-enriched loci.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Increasing evidences suggest that most of the genome is transcribed into RNAs, but many of them are not translated into proteins. All those RNAs that do not become proteins are called 'non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)', which outnumbers protein-coding genes. Interestingly, these ncRNAs are shown to be more tissue specifically expressed than protein-coding genes. Given that tissue-specific expressions of transcripts suggest their importance in the expressed tissue, researchers are conducting biological experiments to elucidate the function of such ncRNAs. Owing greatly to the advancement of next-generation techniques, especially RNA-seq, the amount of high-throughput data are increasing rapidly. However, due to the complexity of the data as well as its high volume, it is not easy to re-analyze such data to extract tissue-specific expressions of ncRNAs from published datasets.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce a new knowledge database called 'C-It-Loci', which allows a user to screen for tissue-specific transcripts across three organisms: human, mouse and zebrafish. C-It-Loci is intuitive and easy to use to identify not only protein-coding genes but also ncRNAs from various tissues. C-It-Loci defines homology through sequence and positional conservation to allow for the extraction of species-conserved loci. C-It-Loci can be used as a starting point for further biological experiments.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>C-It-Loci is freely available online without registration at http://c-it-loci.uni-frankfurt.de.<h4>Contact</h4>uchida@med.uni-frankfurt.de<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,7.0,,c-it-loci,,20.9917771,ok,,it-loci,,v2,0.9917771,C-It-Loci,True,True,True,,http://c-it-loci.uni-frankfurt.de,http://c-it-loci.uni-frankfurt.de,True,...s freely available online without registration at http://c-it-loci.uni-frankfurt.de.<h4>Contact</h4>uchida@med.uni-frankfurt.de<h4>Su...,1

27508329,Connection Map for Compounds (CMC): A Server for Combinatorial Drug Toxicity and Efficacy Analysis.,"Drug discovery and development is a costly and time-consuming process with a high risk for failure resulting primarily from a drug's associated clinical safety and efficacy potential. Identifying and eliminating inapt candidate drugs as early as possible is an effective way for reducing unnecessary costs, but limited analytical tools are currently available for this purpose. Recent growth in the area of toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomics has provided with a vast amount of drug expression microarray data. Web servers such as CMap and LTMap have used this information to evaluate drug toxicity and mechanisms of action independently; however, their wider applicability has been limited by the lack of a combinatorial drug-safety type of analysis. Using available genome-wide drug transcriptional expression profiles, we developed the first web server for combinatorial evaluation of toxicity and efficacy of candidate drugs named ""Connection Map for Compounds"" (CMC). Using CMC, researchers can initially compare their query drug gene signatures with prebuilt gene profiles generated from two large-scale toxicogenomics databases, and subsequently perform a drug efficacy analysis for identification of known mechanisms of drug action or generation of new predictions. CMC provides a novel approach for drug repositioning and early evaluation in drug discovery with its unique combination of toxicity and efficacy analyses, expansibility of data and algorithms, and customization of reference gene profiles.

Identifying and utilizing synteny blocks, which are genomic regions conserved among multiple species, is key to understanding genomic architecture and the evolutionary history of genomes. However, the construction and visualization of such synteny blocks from multiple species are very challenging, especially for biologists with a lack of computational skills.

23945046,kClust: fast and sensitive clustering of large protein sequence databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Fueled by rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing, the size of public sequence databases doubles every two years. Searching the ever larger and more redundant databases is getting increasingly inefficient. Clustering can help to organize sequences into homologous and functionally similar groups and can improve the speed, sensitivity, and readability of homology searches. However, because the clustering time is quadratic in the number of sequences, standard sequence search methods are becoming impracticable.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present a method to cluster large protein sequence databases such as UniProt within days down to 20%-30% maximum pairwise sequence identity. kClust owes its speed and sensitivity to an alignment-free prefilter that calculates the cumulative score of all similar 6-mers between pairs of sequences, and to a dynamic programming algorithm that operates on pairs of similar 4-mers. To increase sensitivity further, kClust can run in profile-sequence comparison mode, with profiles computed from the clusters of a previous kClust iteration. kClust is two to three orders of magnitude faster than clustering based on NCBI BLAST, and on multidomain sequences of 20%-30% maximum pairwise sequence identity it achieves comparable sensitivity and a lower false discovery rate. It also compares favorably to CD-HIT and UCLUST in terms of false discovery rate, sensitivity, and speed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>kClust fills the need for a fast, sensitive, and accurate tool to cluster large protein sequence databases to below 30% sequence identity. kClust is freely available under GPL at http://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/pub/kClust/.",True,False,6.0,,,kclust,20.9848124,ok,,uniprot,hit | clust,v2,0.9848124,kClust,True,True,True,,http://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/pub/kClust/,http://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/pub/kClust/,True,...identity. kClust is freely available under GPL at http://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/pub/kClust/.,1

25306238,VAS: a convenient web portal for efficient integration of genomic features with millions of genetic variants.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput experimental methods have fostered the systematic detection of millions of genetic variants from any human genome. To help explore the potential biological implications of these genetic variants, software tools have been previously developed for integrating various types of information about these genomic regions from multiple data sources. Most of these tools were designed either for studying a small number of variants at a time, or for local execution on powerful machines.<h4>Results</h4>To make exploration of whole lists of genetic variants simple and accessible, we have developed a new Web-based system called VAS (Variant Annotation System, available at https://yiplab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/vas/). It provides a large variety of information useful for studying both coding and non-coding variants, including whole-genome transcription factor binding, open chromatin and transcription data from the ENCODE consortium. By means of data compression, millions of variants can be uploaded from a client machine to the server in less than 50 megabytes of data. On the server side, our customized data integration algorithms can efficiently link millions of variants with tens of whole-genome datasets. These two enabling technologies make VAS a practical tool for annotating genetic variants from large genomic studies. We demonstrate the use of VAS in annotating genetic variants obtained from a migraine meta-analysis study and multiple data sets from the Personal Genomes Project. We also compare the running time of annotating 6.4 million SNPs of the CEU trio by VAS and another tool, showing that VAS is efficient in handling new variant lists without requiring any pre-computations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>VAS is specially designed to handle annotation tasks with long lists of genetic variants and large numbers of annotating features efficiently. It is complementary to other existing tools with more specific aims such as evaluating the potential impacts of genetic variants in terms of disease risk.

A collection of over 12,000 N. gonorrhoeae genome sequences from public archives has been quality-checked, assembled and made public together with available metadata for contextualization.<h4>Results</h4>AMR prediction from genome data revealed specificity values over 99% for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone and sensitivity values around 99% for benzylpenicillin and tetracycline. A case study using the Pathogenwatch collection of N. gonorrhoeae public genomes showed the global expansion of an azithromycin-resistant lineage carrying a mosaic mtr over at least the last 10 years, emphasising the power of Pathogenwatch to explore and evaluate genomic epidemiology questions of public health concern.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The N. gonorrhoeae scheme in Pathogenwatch provides customised bioinformatic pipelines guided by expert opinion that can be adapted to public health agencies and departments with little expertise in bioinformatics and lower-resourced settings with internet connection but limited computational infrastructure. The advisory group will assess and identify ongoing public health needs in the field of gonorrhoea, particularly regarding gonococcal AMR, in order to further enhance utility with modified or new analytic methods.",True,False,4.0,,pathogenwatch,,20.95615596,ok,,,,v2,0.95615596,,True,False,False,,https://pathogen.watch/ngonorrhoeae,https://pathogen.watch/ngonorrhoeae,True,...epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae at Pathogenwatch ( https://pathogen.watch/ngonorrhoeae ).

32611314,Glutantβase: a database for improving the rational design of glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases.,"Β-glucosidases are key enzymes used in second-generation biofuel production. They act in the last step of the lignocellulose saccharification, converting cellobiose in glucose. However, most of the β-glucosidases are inhibited by high glucose concentrations, which turns it a limiting step for industrial production. Thus, β-glucosidases have been targeted by several studies aiming to understand the mechanism of glucose tolerance, pH and thermal resistance for constructing more efficient enzymes. In this paper, we present a database of β-glucosidase structures, called Glutantβase. Our database includes 3842 GH1 β-glucosidase sequences collected from UniProt. We modeled the sequences by comparison and predicted important features in the 3D-structure of each enzyme. Glutantβase provides information about catalytic and conserved amino acids, residues of the coevolution network, protein secondary structure, and residues located in the channel that guides to the active site. We also analyzed the impact of beneficial mutations reported in the literature, predicted in analogous positions, for similar enzymes. We suggested these mutations based on six previously described mutants that showed high catalytic activity, glucose tolerance, or thermostability (A404V, E96K, H184F, H228T, L441F, and V174C). Then, we used molecular docking to verify the impact of the suggested mutations in the affinity of protein and ligands (substrate and product). Our results suggest that only mutations based on the H228T mutant can reduce the affinity for glucose (product) and increase affinity for cellobiose (substrate), which indicates an increment in the resistance to product inhibition and agrees with computational and experimental results previously reported in the literature. More resistant β-glucosidases are essential to saccharification in industrial applications. However, thermostable and glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases are rare, and their glucose tolerance mechanisms appear to be related to multiple and complex factors. We gather here, a set of information, and made predictions aiming to provide a tool for supporting the rational design of more efficient β-glucosidases. We hope that Glutantβase can help improve second-generation biofuel production.

24393765,NCBI disease corpus: a resource for disease name recognition and concept normalization.,"Information encoded in natural language in biomedical literature publications is only useful if efficient and reliable ways of accessing and analyzing that information are available. Natural language processing and text mining tools are therefore essential for extracting valuable information, however, the development of powerful, highly effective tools to automatically detect central biomedical concepts such as diseases is conditional on the availability of annotated corpora. This paper presents the disease name and concept annotations of the NCBI disease corpus, a collection of 793 PubMed abstracts fully annotated at the mention and concept level to serve as a research resource for the biomedical natural language processing community. Each PubMed abstract was manually annotated by two annotators with disease mentions and their corresponding concepts in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH®) or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®). Manual curation was performed using PubTator, which allowed the use of pre-annotations as a pre-step to manual annotations. Fourteen annotators were randomly paired and differing annotations were discussed for reaching a consensus in two annotation phases. In this setting, a high inter-annotator agreement was observed. Finally, all results were checked against annotations of the rest of the corpus to assure corpus-wide consistency. The public release of the NCBI disease corpus contains 6892 disease mentions, which are mapped to 790 unique disease concepts. Of these, 88% link to a MeSH identifier, while the rest contain an OMIM identifier. We were able to link 91% of the mentions to a single disease concept, while the rest are described as a combination of concepts. In order to help researchers use the corpus to design and test disease identification methods, we have prepared the corpus as training, testing and development sets. To demonstrate its utility, we conducted a benchmarking experiment where we compared three different knowledge-based disease normalization methods with a best performance in F-measure of 63.7%. These results show that the NCBI disease corpus has the potential to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in disease name recognition and normalization research, by providing a high-quality gold standard thus enabling the development of machine-learning based approaches for such tasks.

27374120,The harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins.,"Genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics efforts rapidly generate a plethora of data on the activity and levels of biomolecules within mammalian cells. At the same time, curation projects that organize knowledge from the biomedical literature into online databases are expanding. Hence, there is a wealth of information about genes, proteins and their associations, with an urgent need for data integration to achieve better knowledge extraction and data reuse. For this purpose, we developed the Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins from over 70 major online resources. We extracted, abstracted and organized data into ∼72 million functional associations between genes/proteins and their attributes. Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules, expression in cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout mouse or human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins, their attributes and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying, browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we computed and visualized gene-gene and attribute-attribute similarity networks, and through unsupervised clustering, identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases, endogenous ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for knockout genes, and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins, and as such, it enables researchers to discover novel relationships between biological entities, as well as form novel data-driven hypotheses for experimental validation.Database URL: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome.",True,False,7.0,,harmonizome,,20.8702323,ok,,,,v2,0.8702323,harmonizome,True,True,True,,http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome,http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome,True,...otheses for experimental validation.Database URL: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome.,1

Here, we introduce our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for the NCI-60 and their access and integration with the other databases. Correlation to transcript microarray expression levels for identical genes and identical cell lines across CellMinerCDB demonstrates the high quality of these new RNA-seq data. We provide composite and isoform transcript expression data and demonstrate diversity in isoform composition for individual cancer- and pharmacologically relevant genes, including HRAS, PTEN, EGFR, RAD51, ALKBH2, BRCA1, ERBB2, TP53, FGFR2, and CTNND1. We reveal cell-specific differences in the overall levels of isoforms and show their linkage to expression of RNA processing and splicing genes as well as resultant alterations in cancer and pharmacologic gene sets. Gene-drug pairings linked by pathways or functions show specific correlations to isoforms compared with composite gene expression, including ALKBH2-benzaldehyde, AKT3-vandetanib, BCR-imatinib, CDK1 and 20-palbociclib, CASP1-imexon, and FGFR3-pazopanib. Loss of MUC1 20 amino acid variable number tandem repeats, which is used to elicit immune response, and the presence of the androgen receptor AR-V4 and -V7 isoforms in all NCI-60 tissue of origin types demonstrate translational relevance.

31433187,EK-DRD: A Comprehensive Database for Drug Repositioning Inspired by Experimental Knowledge.,"Drug repositioning, or the identification of new indications for approved therapeutic drugs, has gained substantial traction with both academics and pharmaceutical companies because it reduces the cost and duration of the drug development pipeline and the likelihood of unforeseen adverse events. To date there has not been a systematic effort to identify such opportunities, in part because of the lack of a comprehensive resource for an enormous amount of unsystematic drug repositioning information to support scientists who could benefit from this endeavor. To address this challenge, we developed a new database, the Experimental Knowledge-Based Drug Repositioning Database (EK-DRD), by using text and data mining as well as manual curation. EK-DRD contains experimentally validated drug repositioning annotation for 1861 FDA-approved and 102 withdrawn small-molecule drugs.

24503543,DRUGSURV: a resource for repositioning of approved and experimental drugs in oncology based on patient survival information.,"The use of existing drugs for new therapeutic applications, commonly referred to as drug repositioning, is a way for fast and cost-efficient drug discovery. Drug repositioning in oncology is commonly initiated by in vitro experimental evidence that a drug exhibits anticancer cytotoxicity. Any independent verification that the observed effects in vitro may be valid in a clinical setting, and that the drug could potentially affect patient survival in vivo is of paramount importance. Despite considerable recent efforts in computational drug repositioning, none of the studies have considered patient survival information in modelling the potential of existing/new drugs in the management of cancer. Therefore, we have developed DRUGSURV; this is the first computational tool to estimate the potential effects of a drug using patient survival information derived from clinical cancer expression data sets. DRUGSURV provides statistical evidence that a drug can affect survival outcome in particular clinical conditions to justify further investigation of the drug anticancer potential and to guide clinical trial design. DRUGSURV covers both approved drugs (∼1700) as well as experimental drugs (∼5000) and is freely available at http://www.bioprofiling.de/drugsurv.",True,False,7.0,,,drugsurv,19.99910873,ok,,,,v2,0.99910873,DRUGSURV,True,True,True,,http://www.bioprofiling.de/drugsurv,http://www.bioprofiling.de/drugsurv,True,...rimental drugs (∼5000) and is freely available at http://www.bioprofiling.de/drugsurv.,1
28914198,PeMtb: A Database of MHC Antigenic Peptide of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"<h4>Background</h4>For design of a subunit vaccine for tuberculosis, identification of antigenic Tcell epitope is of utmost importance. Several MHC prediction server are available that can accurately predict antigenic peptide of variable lengths. However, peptides predicted from one server not necessarily are predicted form another server, thus creating a confusing situation for scientists to choose a best epitope.<h4>Method</h4>Keeping the above problem in mind, we developed a comprehensive database of peptides of Mycobacterial proteins. Each protein was taken from PubMed and was run through different MHC prediction servers, with the results being compiled into one database.<h4>Results</h4>For each protein, PeMtb generates a set of three different mers of variable lengths (12 mer or 13-mer) based on their ranking; with each mer being predicted for a plethora of MHC alleles. Researcher can choose the peptide (mers) that gives best binding affinity from most of the servers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The database relieves the investigators of the painstaking task of searching various MHC prediction servers for the right epitope (T-cell epitope) for a particular Mycobacterial antigen. We trust and anticipate that PeMtb will be a practical platform for trial and computational analyses of antigenic peptides for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

26424084,miRSponge: a manually curated database for experimentally supported miRNA sponges and ceRNAs.,"In this study, we describe miRSponge, a manually curated database, which aims at providing an experimentally supported resource for microRNA (miRNA) sponges. Recent evidence suggests that miRNAs are themselves regulated by competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or 'miRNA sponges' that contain miRNA binding sites. These competitive molecules can sequester miRNAs to prevent them interacting with their natural targets to play critical roles in various biological and pathological processes. It has become increasingly important to develop a high quality database to record and store ceRNA data to support future studies. To this end, we have established the experimentally supported miRSponge database that contains data on 599 miRNA-sponge interactions and 463 ceRNA relationships from 11 species following manual curating from nearly 1200 published articles. Database classes include endogenously generated molecules including coding genes, pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, along with exogenously introduced molecules including viral RNAs and artificial engineered sponges. Approximately 70% of the interactions were identified experimentally in disease states. miRSponge provides a user-friendly interface for convenient browsing, retrieval and downloading of dataset. A submission page is also included to allow researchers to submit newly validated miRNA sponge data.

34585726,EpiSurf: metadata-driven search server for analyzing amino acid changes within epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral species.,"EpiSurf is a Web application for selecting viral populations of interest and then analyzing how their amino acid changes are distributed along epitopes. Viral sequences are searched within ViruSurf, which stores curated metadata and amino acid changes imported from the most widely used deposition sources for viral databases (GenBank, COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) and Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID)). Epitopes are searched within the open source Immune Epitope Database or directly proposed by users by indicating their start and stop positions in the context of a given viral protein. Amino acid changes of selected populations are joined with epitopes of interest; a result table summarizes, for each epitope, statistics about the overlapping amino acid changes and about the sequences carrying such alterations. The results may also be inspected by the VirusViz Web application; epitope regions are highlighted within the given viral protein, and changes can be comparatively inspected. For sequences mutated within the epitope, we also offer a complete view of the distribution of amino acid changes, optionally grouped by the location, collection date or lineage. Thanks to these functionalities, EpiSurf supports the user-friendly testing of epitope conservancy within selected populations of interest, which can be of utmost relevance for designing vaccines, drugs or serological assays.

Herein, we describe how this platform is used to obtain a brief or detailed gene ontology (GO)-type categories, including subcellular localization(s), for the queried proteins by combining the CELLO localization-predicting and BLAST homology-searching approaches. Given a query protein sequence, CELLO2GO uses BLAST to search for homologous sequences that are GO annotated in an in-house database derived from the UniProt KnowledgeBase database. At the same time, CELLO attempts predict at least one subcellular localization on the basis of the species in which the protein is found. When homologs for the query sequence have been identified, the number of terms found for each of their GO categories, i.e., cellular compartment, molecular function, and biological process, are summed and presented as pie charts representing possible functional annotations for the queried protein. Although the experimental subcellular localization of a protein may not be known, and thus not annotated, CELLO can confidentially suggest a subcellular localization. CELLO2GO should be a useful tool for research involving complex subcellular systems because it combines CELLO and BLAST into one platform and its output is easily manipulated such that the user-specific questions may be readily addressed.",True,False,7.0,,,cello2go,19.9990123,ok,,uniprot,cello,v2,0.9990123,CELLO2GO,True,True,True,,http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/cello2go/,http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/cello2go/,True,"CELLO2GO (http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/cello2go/) is a publicly available, web-based system for sc...",1

Up to date, gene expression data generated using either microarray or RNA-sequencing are available for many bacterial genomes. However, differential gene expression is usually investigated with methods considering each gene independently, thus not taking into account the physical localization of genes along a bacterial chromosome. Here, we present WoPPER, a web tool integrating gene expression and genomic annotations to identify differentially expressed chromosomal regions in bacteria. RNA-sequencing or microarray-based gene expression data are provided as input, along with gene annotations. The user can select genomic annotations from an internal database including 2780 bacterial strains, or provide custom genomic annotations. The analysis produces as output the lists of positionally related genes showing a coordinated trend of differential expression. Graphical representations, including a circular plot of the analyzed chromosome, allow intuitive browsing of the results. The analysis procedure is based on our previously published R-package PREDA. The release of this tool is timely and relevant for the scientific community, as WoPPER will fill an existing gap in prokaryotic gene expression data analysis and visualization tools.

The ultrastructural images collected through ssEM are content rich and their comprehensive analysis is beyond the capacity of an individual laboratory. Hence, sharing ultrastructural data is becoming crucial to visualize, analyze, and discover the structural basis of synaptic circuitry and function in the brain. We devised a web-based management system called SynapticDB (http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/synapticdb/) that catalogues, extracts, analyzes, and shares experimental data from ssEM. The management strategy involves a library with check-in, checkout and experimental tracking mechanisms. We developed a series of spreadsheet templates (MS Excel, Open Office spreadsheet, etc) that guide users in methods of data collection, structural identification, and quantitative analysis through ssEM. SynapticDB provides flexible access to complete templates, or to individual columns with instructional headers that can be selected to create user-defined templates. New templates can also be generated and uploaded. Research progress is tracked via experimental note management and dynamic PDF forms that allow new investigators to follow standard protocols and experienced researchers to expand the range of data collected and shared. The combined use of templates and tracking notes ensures that the supporting experimental information is populated into the database and associated with the appropriate ssEM images and analyses.

However, the vast majority of them remain to be functionally characterized. Computational investigation of potential functions of human lncRNA genes is helpful to guide further experimental studies on lncRNAs.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, based on expression correlation between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes across 19 human normal tissues, we used the hypergeometric test to functionally annotate a single lncRNA or a set of lncRNAs with significantly enriched functional terms among the protein-coding genes that are significantly co-expressed with the lncRNA(s). The functional terms include all nodes in the Gene Ontology (GO) and 4,380 human biological pathways collected from 12 pathway databases. We successfully mapped 9,625 human lncRNA genes to GO terms and biological pathways, and then developed the first ontology-driven user-friendly web interface named lncRNA2Function, which enables researchers to browse the lncRNAs associated with a specific functional term, the functional terms associated with a specific lncRNA, or to assign functional terms to a set of human lncRNA genes, such as a cluster of co-expressed lncRNAs.

As new fields of root hair research are emerging, the number of new papers published each year and the volumes of new relevant data are continuously increasing. Therefore, there is a general need to facilitate studies on root hair biology by collecting, presenting, and sharing the available information in a systematic, curated manner. Consequently, in this paper, we present a comprehensive database of root hair genomics, iRootHair, which is accessible as a Web-based service. The current version of the database includes information about 153 root hair-related genes that have been identified to date in dicots and monocots along with their putative orthologs in higher plants with sequenced genomes.

Thousands of HDACi targeting HDACs are in various stages of development and are being tested in clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer agents. Despite the abundance of HDACi, information resources are limited. Tools for in silico experiments on specific HDACi prediction, for designing and analyzing the generated data, as well as custom-made specific tools and interactive databases, are needed. We have developed an HDACiDB that is a composite collection of HDACi and currently comprises 1,445 chemical compounds, including 419 natural and 1,026 synthetic ones having the potential to inhibit histone deacetylation. Most importantly, it will allow application of Lipinski's rule of five drug-likeness and other physicochemical property-based screening of the inhibitors. It also provides easy access to information on their source of origin, molecular properties, drug likeness, as well as bioavailability with relevant references cited. Being the first comprehensive database on HDACi that contains all known natural and synthetic HDACi, the HDACiDB may help to improve our knowledge concerning the mechanisms of actions of available HDACi and enable us to selectively target individual HDAC isoforms and establish a new paradigm for intelligent epigenetic cancer drug design.

Through data mining from 2154 datasets of small RNA sequencing data from four species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster), we have identified 8 749 139 piRNA isoforms from 175 454 canonical piRNAs, and classified them on the basis of variations on 5' or 3' end via the alignment of isoforms with canonical sequence. We thus established a database named IsopiRBank. Each isoforms has detailed annotation as follows: normalized expression data, classification, spatiotemporal expression data and genome origin.

A total of six RNAseq samples of R. solani AG1 IA were also analysed, corresponding to 10, 18, 24, 32, 48 and 72 h after infection of rice leaves. The RSIADB database enables users to search, browse, and download gene sequences for R. solani AG1 IA, and mine the data using BLAST, Sequence Extractor, Browse and Construction Diagram tools that were integrated into the database. RSIADB is an important genomic resource for scientists working with R. solani AG1 IA and will assist researchers in analysing the annotated genome and transcriptome of this pathogen. This resource will facilitate studies on gene function, pathogenesis factors and secreted proteins, as well as provide an avenue for comparative analyses of genes expressed during different stages of infection.

28012137,VaProS: a database-integration approach for protein/genome information retrieval.,"Life science research now heavily relies on all sorts of databases for genome sequences, transcription, protein three-dimensional (3D) structures, protein-protein interactions, phenotypes and so forth. The knowledge accumulated by all the omics research is so vast that a computer-aided search of data is now a prerequisite for starting a new study. In addition, a combinatory search throughout these databases has a chance to extract new ideas and new hypotheses that can be examined by wet-lab experiments. By virtually integrating the related databases on the Internet, we have built a new web application that facilitates life science researchers for retrieving experts' knowledge stored in the databases and for building a new hypothesis of the research target. This web application, named VaProS, puts stress on the interconnection between the functional information of genome sequences and protein 3D structures, such as structural effect of the gene mutation. In this manuscript, we present the notion of VaProS, the databases and tools that can be accessed without any knowledge of database locations and data formats, and the power of search exemplified in quest of the molecular mechanisms of lysosomal storage disease.

32421769,PlaToLoCo: the first web meta-server for visualization and annotation of low complexity regions in proteins.,"Low complexity regions (LCRs) in protein sequences are characterized by a less diverse amino acid composition compared to typically observed sequence diversity. Recent studies have shown that LCRs may co-occur with intrinsically disordered regions, are highly conserved in many organisms, and often play important roles in protein functions and in diseases. In previous decades, several methods have been developed to identify regions with LCRs or amino acid bias, but most of them as stand-alone applications and currently there is no web-based tool which allows users to explore LCRs in protein sequences with additional functional annotations. We aim to fill this gap by providing PlaToLoCo - PLAtform of TOols for LOw COmplexity-a meta-server that integrates and collects the output of five different state-of-the-art tools for discovering LCRs and provides functional annotations such as domain detection, transmembrane segment prediction, and calculation of amino acid frequencies. In addition, the union or intersection of the results of the search on a query sequence can be obtained. By developing the PlaToLoCo meta-server, we provide the community with a fast and easily accessible tool for the analysis of LCRs with additional information included to aid the interpretation of the results.

33963857,Proteo3Dnet: a web server for the integration of structural information with interactomics data.,"Proteo3Dnet is a web server dedicated to the analysis of mass spectrometry interactomics experiments. Given a flat list of proteins, its aim is to organize it in terms of structural interactions to provide a clearer overview of the data. This is achieved using three means: (i) the search for interologs with resolved structure available in the protein data bank, including cross-species remote homology search, (ii) the search for possibly weaker interactions mediated through Short Linear Motifs as predicted by ELM-a unique feature of Proteo3Dnet, (iii) the search for protein-protein interactions physically validated in the BioGRID database. The server then compiles this information and returns a graph of the identified interactions and details about the different searches. The graph can be interactively explored to understand the way the core complexes identified could interact. It can also suggest undetected partners to the experimentalists, or specific cases of conditionally exclusive binding. The interest of Proteo3Dnet, previously demonstrated for the difficult cases of the proteasome and pragmin complexes data is, here, illustrated in the context of yeast precursors to the small ribosomal subunits and the smaller interactome of 14-3-3zeta frequent interactors.

31669269,RNAdt: An online tutorial and data portal for the RNA structurome era.,"RNA is not only a passive transporter of genetic information, but also a pivotal player in all domains of life. RNA can regulate gene expression because of its involvement in transcription, mRNA modification and processing, and translation. RNA also possesses other intricate functions such as catalysis, ligand sensing, interaction with biomolecules, response to environment stresses, and information storage. The primary structure of RNA is single stranded, but it always folds into complex secondary and tertiary structures owing to base pairing and effects from the cellular environment. The importance of structure has been increasingly recognized in understanding the myriad functions of RNA. After decades of development, there is a wide range of RNA structure probing techniques. The marriage between structure probing and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) especially enables the measurement of RNA structure on a transcriptomic scale, advancing the advent of the RNA structurome era. Dozens of HTS-associated RNA structure probing methods have been published, so it is urgent to provide a user-friendly and easy-to-use resource for users who are perplexed by selecting the most suitable method for their experiments. Motivated by this demand, we collected currently available HTS-associated RNA structure probing methods and then developed RNAdt (freely accessible at http://www.zhounan.org/rnadt). RNAdt can be used as a web-based tutorial to learn fundamental knowledge of HTS-associated RNA structure probing methods. RNAdt can also be used as a data portal to access HTS data sets from previous RNA structurome studies. At the end of this work, we also provided perspectives on future development of RNA structure probing methods.

23028445,PHYMYCO-DB: a curated database for analyses of fungal diversity and evolution.,"<h4>Background</h4>In environmental sequencing studies, fungi can be identified based on nucleic acid sequences, using either highly variable sequences as species barcodes or conserved sequences containing a high-quality phylogenetic signal. For the latter, identification relies on phylogenetic analyses and the adoption of the phylogenetic species concept. Such analysis requires that the reference sequences are well identified and deposited in public-access databases. However, many entries in the public sequence databases are problematic in terms of quality and reliability and these data require screening to ensure correct phylogenetic interpretation.<h4>Methods and principal findings</h4>To facilitate phylogenetic inferences and phylogenetic assignment, we introduce a fungal sequence database. The database PHYMYCO-DB comprises fungal sequences from GenBank that have been filtered to satisfy stringent sequence quality criteria. For the first release, two widely used molecular taxonomic markers were chosen: the nuclear SSU rRNA and EF1-α gene sequences. Following the automatic extraction and filtration, a manual curation is performed to remove problematic sequences while preserving relevant sequences useful for phylogenetic studies. As a result of curation, ~20% of the automatically filtered sequences have been removed from the database. To demonstrate how PHYMYCO-DB can be employed, we test a set of environmental Chytridiomycota sequences obtained from deep sea samples.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PHYMYCO-DB offers the tools necessary to: (i) extract high quality fungal sequences for each of the 5 fungal phyla, at all taxonomic levels, (ii) extract already performed alignments, to act as 'reference alignments', (iii) launch alignments of personal sequences along with stored data.

23356573,Seq2Ref: a web server to facilitate functional interpretation.,"<h4>Background</h4>The size of the protein sequence database has been exponentially increasing due to advances in genome sequencing. However, experimentally characterized proteins only constitute a small portion of the database, such that the majority of sequences have been annotated by computational approaches. Current automatic annotation pipelines inevitably introduce errors, making the annotations unreliable. Instead of such error-prone automatic annotations, functional interpretation should rely on annotations of 'reference proteins' that have been experimentally characterized or manually curated.<h4>Results</h4>The Seq2Ref server uses BLAST to detect proteins homologous to a query sequence and identifies the reference proteins among them. Seq2Ref then reports publications with experimental characterizations of the identified reference proteins that might be relevant to the query. Furthermore, a plurality-based rating system is developed to evaluate the homologous relationships and rank the reference proteins by their relevance to the query.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reference proteins detected by our server will lend insight into proteins of unknown function and provide extensive information to develop in-depth understanding of uncharacterized proteins.

32501478,SnpHub: an easy-to-set-up web server framework for exploring large-scale genomic variation data in the post-genomic era with applications in wheat.,"<h4>Background</h4>The cost of high-throughput sequencing is rapidly decreasing, allowing researchers to investigate genomic variations across hundreds or even thousands of samples in the post-genomic era. The management and exploration of these large-scale genomic variation data require programming skills. The public genotype querying databases of many species are usually centralized and implemented independently, making them difficult to update with new data over time. Currently, there is a lack of a widely used framework for setting up user-friendly web servers to explore new genomic variation data in diverse species.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present SnpHub, a Shiny/R-based server framework for retrieving, analysing, and visualizing large-scale genomic variation data that can be easily set up on any Linux server. After a pre-building process based on the provided VCF files and genome annotation files, the local server allows users to interactively access single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions/deletions with annotation information by locus or gene and to define sample sets through a web page. Users can freely analyse and visualize genomic variations in heatmaps, phylogenetic trees, haplotype networks, or geographical maps. Sample-specific sequences can be accessed as replaced by detected sequence variations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SnpHub can be applied to any species, and we build up a SnpHub portal website for wheat and its progenitors based on published data in recent studies.

29140522,ECOdrug: a database connecting drugs and conservation of their targets across species.,"Pharmaceuticals are designed to interact with specific molecular targets in humans and these targets generally have orthologs in other species. This provides opportunities for the drug discovery community to use alternative model species for drug development. It also means, however, there is potential for mode of action related effects in non-target wildlife species as many pharmaceuticals reach the environment through patient use and manufacturing wastes. Acquiring insight in drug target ortholog predictions across species and taxonomic groups has proven difficult because of the lack of an optimal strategy and because necessary information is spread across multiple and diverse sources and platforms. We introduce a new research platform tool, ECOdrug, that reliably connects drugs to their protein targets across divergent species. It harmonizes ortholog predictions from multiple sources via a simple user interface underpinning critical applications for a wide range of studies in pharmacology, ecotoxicology and comparative evolutionary biology. ECOdrug can be used to identify species with drug targets and identify drugs that interact with those targets.

Most of the existing methods for this task are based on active site similarity and present limitations including performing only exact matches on template residues, template size restraints, despite not being capable of finding inter-domain active sites. To fill this gap, we proposed GASS-WEB, a user-friendly web server that uses GASS (Genetic Active Site Search), a method based on an evolutionary algorithm to search for similar active sites in proteins. GASS-WEB can be used under two different scenarios: (i) given a protein of interest, to match a set of specific active site templates; or (ii) given an active site template, looking for it in a database of protein structures. The method has shown to be very effective on a range of experiments and was able to correctly identify >90% of the catalogued active sites from the Catalytic Site Atlas. It also managed to achieve a Matthew correlation coefficient of 0.63 using the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP 10) dataset. In our analysis, GASS was ranking fourth among 18 methods.

However, population-specific differences in codon usage biases remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a web server, https://cubap.byu.edu, to facilitate analyses of codon usage biases across populations (CUBAP). Using the 1000 Genomes Project, we calculated and visually depict population-specific differences in codon frequencies, codon aversion, identical codon pairing, co-tRNA codon pairing, ramp sequences, and nucleotide composition in 17,634 genes. We found that codon pairing significantly differs between populations in 35.8% of genes, allowing us to successfully predict the place of origin for African and East Asian individuals with 98.8% and 100% accuracy, respectively. We also used CUBAP to identify a significant bias toward decreased CTG pairing in the immunity related GTPase M (IRGM) gene in East Asian and African populations, which may contribute to the decreased association of rs10065172 with Crohn's disease in those populations.

In literature a few siRNA databases have been reported that focus on targeting human and mammalian genes but experimentally validated viral siRNA databases are lacking. We have developed VIRsiRNAdb, a manually curated database having comprehensive details of 1358 siRNA/shRNA targeting viral genome regions. Further, wherever available, information regarding alternative efficacies of above 300 siRNAs derived from different assays has also been incorporated. Important fields included in the database are siRNA sequence, virus subtype, target genome region, cell type, target object, experimental assay, efficacy, off-target and siRNA matching with reference viral sequences. Database also provides the users with facilities of advance search, browsing, data submission, linking to external databases and useful siRNA analysis tools especially siTarAlign which align the siRNA with reference viral genomes or user defined sequences. VIRsiRNAdb contains extensive details of siRNA/shRNA targeting 42 important human viruses including influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, HPV and SARS Corona virus.

The predictor only uses protein sequences as input and no complex features are needed, which results in a real-time prediction for a large number of proteins. It takes less than three minutes to predict for 1000 sequences per PTM type. The output is presented at the amino acid level for the user-selected PTM types. The framework has been benchmarked and has demonstrated competitive performance in PTM site predictions by other researchers. In this webserver, we updated the previous framework by utilizing more advanced ensemble techniques, and providing prediction and visualization for multiple PTMs simultaneously for users to analyze potential PTM cross-talks directly. Besides prediction, users can interactively review the predicted PTM sites in the context of known PTM annotations and protein 3D structures through homology-based search. In addition, the server maintains a local database providing pre-processed PTM annotations from Uniport/Swiss-Prot for users to download. This database will be updated every three months.

29724163,EuGI: a novel resource for studying genomic islands to facilitate horizontal gene transfer detection in eukaryotes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genomic islands (GIs) are inserts of foreign DNA that have potentially arisen through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). There are evidences that GIs can contribute significantly to the evolution of prokaryotes. The acquisition of GIs through HGT in eukaryotes has, however, been largely unexplored. In this study, the previously developed GI prediction tool, SeqWord Gene Island Sniffer (SWGIS), is modified to predict GIs in eukaryotic chromosomes. Artificial simulations are used to estimate ratios of predicting false positive and false negative GIs by inserting GIs into different test chromosomes and performing the SWGIS v2.0 algorithm. Using SWGIS v2.0, GIs are then identified in 36 fungal, 22 protozoan and 8 invertebrate genomes.<h4>Results</h4>SWGIS v2.0 predicts GIs in large eukaryotic chromosomes based on the atypical nucleotide composition of these regions. Averages for predicting false negative and false positive GIs were 20.1% and 11.01% respectively. A total of 10,550 GIs were identified in 66 eukaryotic species with 5299 of these GIs coding for at least one functional protein. The EuGI web-resource, freely accessible at http://eugi.bi.up.ac.za , was developed that allows browsing the database created from identified GIs and genes within GIs through an interactive and visual interface.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SWGIS v2.0 along with the EuGI database, which houses GIs identified in 66 different eukaryotic species, and the EuGI web-resource, provide the first comprehensive resource for studying HGT in eukaryotes.",True,False,3.0,,,eugi,19.9981129,ok,,prokaryotes,,v2,0.9981129,EuGI,True,True,True,,http://eugi.bi.up.ac.za,http://eugi.bi.up.ac.za,True,"...tein.

24573881,"AnaLysis of Expression on human chromosome 21, ALE-HSA21: a pilot integrated web resource.","Transcriptome studies have shown the pervasive nature of transcription, demonstrating almost all the genes undergo alternative splicing. Accurately annotating all transcripts of a gene is crucial. It is needed to understand the impact of mutations on phenotypes, to shed light on genetic and epigenetic regulation of mRNAs and more generally to widen our knowledge about cell functionality and tissue diversity. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), and the other applications of the next-generation sequencing, provides precious data to improve annotations' accuracy, simultaneously creating issues related to the variety, complexity and the size of produced data. In this 'scenario', the lack of user-friendly resources, easily accessible to researchers with low skills in bioinformatics, makes difficult to retrieve complete information about one or few genes without browsing a jungle of databases. Concordantly, the increasing amount of data from 'omics' technologies imposes to develop integrated databases merging different data formats coming from distinct but complementary sources. In light of these considerations, and given the wide interest in studying Down syndrome-a genetic condition due to the trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA21)-we developed an integrated relational database and a web interface, named ALE-HSA21 (AnaLysis of Expression on HSA21), accessible at http://bioinfo.na.iac.cnr.it/ALE-HSA21. This comprehensive and user-friendly web resource integrates-for all coding and noncoding transcripts of chromosome 21-existing gene annotations and transcripts identified de novo through RNA-Seq analysis with predictive computational analysis of regulatory sequences. Given the role of noncoding RNAs and untranslated regions of coding genes in key regulatory mechanisms, ALE-HSA21 is also an interesting web-based platform to investigate such processes. The 'transcript-centric' and easily-accessible nature of ALE-HSA21 makes this resource a valuable tool to rapidly retrieve data at the isoform level, rather than at gene level, useful to investigate any disease, molecular pathway or cell process involving chromosome 21 genes.

With the advent of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, computational tools are needed to explore and analyze the list of variants for further validation. Correlating genetic variants with subject phenotype is crucial for the interpretation of the disease-causing mutations. Often such work is done by teams of researchers who need to share information and coordinate activities. To this end, we have developed a powerful, easy to use Web application, ASPIREdb, which allows researchers to search, organize, analyze, and visualize variants and phenotypes associated with a set of human subjects. Investigators can annotate variants using publicly available reference databases and build powerful queries to identify subjects or variants of interest. Functional information and phenotypic associations of these genes are made accessible as well. Burden analysis and additional reporting tools allow investigation of variant properties and phenotype characteristics. Projects can be shared, allowing researchers to work collaboratively to build queries and annotate the data.

27083180,SEARCHBreast: a new resource to locate and share surplus archival material from breast cancer animal models to help address the 3Rs.,"Animal models have contributed to our understanding of breast cancer, with publication of results in high-impact journals almost invariably requiring extensive in vivo experimentation. As such, many laboratories hold large collections of surplus animal material, with only a fraction being used in publications relating to the original projects. Despite being developed at considerable cost, this material is an invisible and hence an underutilised resource, which often ends up being discarded. Within the breast cancer research community there is both a need and desire to make this valuable material available for researchers. Lack of a coordinated system for visualisation and localisation of this has prevented progress. To fulfil this unmet need, we have developed a novel initiative called Sharing Experimental Animal Resources: Coordinating Holdings-Breast (SEARCHBreast) which facilitates sharing of archival tissue between researchers on a collaborative basis and, de facto will reduce overall usage of animal models in breast cancer research. A secure searchable database has been developed where researchers can find, share, or upload materials related to animal models of breast cancer, including genetic and transplant models. SEARCHBreast is a virtual compendium where the physical material remains with the original laboratory. A bioanalysis pipeline is being developed for the analysis of transcriptomics data associated with mouse models, allowing comparative study with human and cell line data.

21372341,Key2Ann: a tool to process sequence sets by replacing database identifiers with a human-readable annotation.,"Deducing common properties or degrees of phylogenetic relationship by analyzing a grouping or clustering of sequence sets is a frequently used technique in computational biology. If interpreted by means of visual inspection, the conclusions depend for many of these applications on meaningful names for the input data. In accordance with the aim of the analysis, the sequences should be provided with names indicating the function of the genes or gene-products, the phylogenetic position or other properties characterizing the contributing species. However, sequences extracted from databases are most often annotated with identifiers which only implicitly contain the desired information. To solve this problem, we have designed and implemented a tool named Key2Ann, which replaces in multiple fasta files the database keys with short terms indicating the taxonomic position or other features like the gene name or the EC-number. In addition, properties like habitat, growth temperature or the degree of pathogenicity can be coded for microbial species. To allow for highest flexibility, the user can control the composition of the names by means of command line parameters.

27316337,PGA: an R/Bioconductor package for identification of novel peptides using a customized database derived from RNA-Seq.,"<h4>Background</h4>Peptide identification based upon mass spectrometry (MS) is generally achieved by comparison of the experimental mass spectra with the theoretically digested peptides derived from a reference protein database. Obviously, this strategy could not identify peptide and protein sequences that are absent from a reference database. A customized protein database on the basis of RNA-Seq data is thus proposed to assist with and improve the identification of novel peptides. Correspondingly, development of a comprehensive pipeline, which provides an end-to-end solution for novel peptide detection with the customized protein database, is necessary.<h4>Results</h4>A pipeline with an R package, assigned as a PGA utility, was developed that enables automated treatment to the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data acquired from different MS platforms and construction of customized protein databases based on RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome guide. Hence, PGA can identify novel peptides and generate an HTML-based report with a visualized interface. On the basis of a published dataset, PGA was employed to identify peptides, resulting in 636 novel peptides, including 510 single amino acid polymorphism (SAP) peptides, 2 INDEL peptides, 49 splice junction peptides, and 75 novel transcript-derived peptides.

24532728,GUILDify: a web server for phenotypic characterization of genes through biological data integration and network-based prioritization algorithms.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Determining genetic factors underlying various phenotypes is hindered by the involvement of multiple genes acting cooperatively. Over the past years, disease-gene prioritization has been central to identify genes implicated in human disorders. Special attention has been paid on using physical interactions between the proteins encoded by the genes to link them with diseases. Such methods exploit the guilt-by-association principle in the protein interaction network to uncover novel disease-gene associations. These methods rely on the proximity of a gene in the network to the genes associated with a phenotype and require a set of initial associations. Here, we present GUILDify, an easy-to-use web server for the phenotypic characterization of genes. GUILDify offers a prioritization approach based on the protein-protein interaction network where the initial phenotype-gene associations are retrieved via free text search on biological databases. GUILDify web server does not restrict the prioritization to any predefined phenotype, supports multiple species and accepts user-specified genes. It also prioritizes drugs based on the ranking of their targets, unleashing opportunities for repurposing drugs for novel therapies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Available online at http://sbi.imim.es/GUILDify.php",True,False,9.0,,guildify,,19.9973454,ok,,,,v2,0.9973454,GUILDify,True,True,True,,http://sbi.imim.es/GUILDify.php,http://sbi.imim.es/GUILDify.php,True,...bility and implementation</h4>Available online at http://sbi.imim.es/GUILDify.php,1
22689642,BIPS: BIANA Interolog Prediction Server. A tool for protein-protein interaction inference.,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in biology, and high-throughput experiments have greatly increased the coverage of known interactions. Still, identification of complete inter- and intraspecies interactomes is far from being complete. Experimental data can be complemented by the prediction of PPIs within an organism or between two organisms based on the known interactions of the orthologous genes of other organisms (interologs). Here, we present the BIANA (Biologic Interactions and Network Analysis) Interolog Prediction Server (BIPS), which offers a web-based interface to facilitate PPI predictions based on interolog information. BIPS benefits from the capabilities of the framework BIANA to integrate the several PPI-related databases. Additional metadata can be used to improve the reliability of the predicted interactions. Sensitivity and specificity of the server have been calculated using known PPIs from different interactomes using a leave-one-out approach. The specificity is between 72 and 98%, whereas sensitivity varies between 1 and 59%, depending on the sequence identity cut-off used to calculate similarities between sequences.

Mapping sequence features to known or predicted protein structures is useful when trying to deduce the function of those features and when evaluating sequence or structural predictions. To facilitate this goal, we developed PDBpaint, a simple tool that displays protein sequence features gathered from bioinformatics resources on top of protein structures, which are displayed in an interactive window (using the Jmol Java viewer). PDBpaint can be used either with existing protein structures or with novel structures provided by the user. The current version of PDBpaint allows the visualization of annotations from Pfam, ARD (detection of HEAT-repeats), UniProt, TMHMM2.0 and SignalP.

31052310,DynaStI: A Dynamic Retention Time Database for Steroidomics.,"<b>:</b> Steroidomics studies face the challenge of separating analytical compounds with very similar structures (i.e., isomers). Liquid chromatography (LC) is commonly used to this end, but the shared core structure of this family of compounds compromises effective separations among the numerous chemical analytes with comparable physico-chemical properties. Careful tuning of the mobile phase gradient and an appropriate choice of the stationary phase can be used to overcome this problem, in turn modifying the retention times in different ways for each compound. In the usual workflow, this approach is suboptimal for the annotation of features based on retention times since it requires characterizing a library of known compounds for every fine-tuned configuration. We introduce a software solution, DynaStI, that is capable of annotating liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) features by dynamically generating the retention times from a database containing intrinsic properties of a library of metabolites. DynaStI uses the well-established linear solvent strength (LSS) model for reversed-phase LC. Given a list of LC-MS features and some characteristics of the LC setup, this software computes the corresponding retention times for the internal database and then annotates the features using the exact masses with predicted retention times at the working conditions. DynaStI (https://dynasti.vital-it.ch) is able to automatically calibrate its predictions to compensate for deviations in the input parameters. The database also includes identification and structural information for each annotation, such as IUPAC name, CAS number, SMILES string, metabolic pathways, and links to external metabolomic or lipidomic databases.",True,False,4.0,,dynasti,,19.99712056,ok,,,,v2,0.99712056,DynaStI,True,True,True,,https://dynasti.vital-it.ch,https://dynasti.vital-it.ch,True,...tention times at the working conditions.

28700230,LigQ: A Webserver to Select and Prepare Ligands for Virtual Screening.,"Virtual screening is a powerful methodology to search for new small molecule inhibitors against a desired molecular target. Usually, it involves evaluating thousands of compounds (derived from large databases) in order to select a set of potential binders that will be tested in the wet-lab. The number of tested compounds is directly proportional to the cost, and thus, the best possible set of ligands is the one with the highest number of true binders, for the smallest possible compound set size. Therefore, methods that are able to trim down large universal data sets enriching them in potential binders are highly appreciated. Here we present LigQ, a free webserver that is able to (i) determine best structure and ligand binding pocket for a desired protein, (ii) find known binders, as well as potential ligands known to bind to similar protein domains, (iii) most importantly, select a small set of commercial compounds enriched in potential binders, and (iv) prepare them for virtual screening.

31802128,RAACBook: a web server of reduced amino acid alphabet for sequence-dependent inference by using Chou's five-step rule.,"By reducing amino acid alphabet, the protein complexity can be significantly simplified, which could improve computational efficiency, decrease information redundancy and reduce chance of overfitting. Although some reduced alphabets have been proposed, different classification rules could produce distinctive results for protein sequence analysis. Thus, it is urgent to construct a systematical frame for reduced alphabets. In this work, we constructed a comprehensive web server called RAACBook for protein sequence analysis and machine learning application by integrating reduction alphabets. The web server contains three parts: (i) 74 types of reduced amino acid alphabet were manually extracted to generate 673 reduced amino acid clusters (RAACs) for dealing with unique protein problems. It is easy for users to select desired RAACs from a multilayer browser tool. (ii) An online tool was developed to analyze primary sequence of protein. The tool could produce K-tuple reduced amino acid composition by defining three correlation parameters (K-tuple, g-gap, λ-correlation). The results are visualized as sequence alignment, mergence of RAA composition, feature distribution and logo of reduced sequence. (iii) The machine learning server is provided to train the model of protein classification based on K-tuple RAAC. The optimal model could be selected according to the evaluation indexes (ROC, AUC, MCC, etc.).

32922207,The CEEDER database of evidence reviews: An open-access evidence service for researchers and decision-makers.,"Evidence-informed decision-making aims to deliver effective actions informed by the best available evidence. Given the large quantity of primary literature, and time constraints faced by policy-makers and practitioners, well-conducted evidence reviews can provide a valuable resource to support decision-making. However, previous research suggests that some evidence reviews may not be sufficiently reliable to inform decisions in the environmental sector due to low standards of conduct and reporting. While some evidence reviews are of high reliability, there is currently no way for policy-makers and practitioners to quickly and easily find them among the many lower reliability ones. Alongside this lack of transparency, there is little incentive or support for review authors, editors and peer-reviewers to improve reliability. To address these issues, we introduce a new online, freely available and first-of-its-kind evidence service: the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Database of Evidence Reviews (CEEDER: www.environmentalevidence.org/ceeder). CEEDER aims to transform communication of evidence review reliability to researchers, policy-makers and practitioners through independent assessment of key aspects of the conduct, reporting and data limitations of available evidence reviews claiming to assess environmental impacts or the effectiveness of interventions relevant to policy and practice.

Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) are actively studied worldwide to find potential genomic targets for the development of novel drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics. Determining which proteins are involved in the interaction system behind an infectious process is the first step to develop an efficient disease control strategy. Very few computational methods have been implemented as web services to infer novel HPIs, and there is not a single framework which combines several of those approaches to produce and visualize a comprehensive analysis of HPIs.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce PredHPI, a powerful framework that integrates both the detection and visualization of interaction networks in a single web service, facilitating the apprehension of model and non-model host-pathogen systems to aid the biologists in building hypotheses and designing appropriate experiments.

27151197,PathwAX: a web server for network crosstalk based pathway annotation.,"Pathway annotation of gene lists is often used to functionally analyse biomolecular data such as gene expression in order to establish which processes are activated in a given experiment. Databases such as KEGG or GO represent collections of how genes are known to be organized in pathways, and the challenge is to compare a given gene list with the known pathways such that all true relations are identified. Most tools apply statistical measures to the gene overlap between the gene list and pathway. It is however problematic to avoid false negatives and false positives when only using the gene overlap. The pathwAX web server (http://pathwAX.sbc.su.se/) applies a different approach which is based on network crosstalk. It uses the comprehensive network FunCoup to analyse network crosstalk between a query gene list and KEGG pathways. PathwAX runs the BinoX algorithm, which employs Monte-Carlo sampling of randomized networks and estimates a binomial distribution, for estimating the statistical significance of the crosstalk.

29678128,SpirPep: an in silico digestion-based platform to assist bioactive peptides discovery from a genome-wide database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bioactive peptides, including biological sources-derived peptides with different biological activities, are protein fragments that influence the functions or conditions of organisms, in particular humans and animals. Conventional methods of identifying bioactive peptides are time-consuming and costly. To quicken the processes, several bioinformatics tools are recently used to facilitate screening of the potential peptides prior their activity assessment in vitro and/or in vivo. In this study, we developed an efficient computational method, SpirPep, which offers many advantages over the currently available tools.<h4>Results</h4>The SpirPep web application tool is a one-stop analysis and visualization facility to assist bioactive peptide discovery. The tool is equipped with 15 customized enzymes and 1-3 miscleavage options, which allows in silico digestion of protein sequences encoded by protein-coding genes from single, multiple, or genome-wide scaling, and then directly classifies the peptides by bioactivity using an in-house database that contains bioactive peptides collected from 13 public databases. With this tool, the resulting peptides are categorized by each selected enzyme, and shown in a tabular format where the peptide sequences can be tracked back to their original proteins. The developed tool and webpages are coded in PHP and HTML with CSS/JavaScript. Moreover, the tool allows protein-peptide alignment visualization by Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) to display the region and details of the proteins and peptides within each parameter, while considering digestion design for the desirable bioactivity. SpirPep is efficient; it takes less than 20 min to digest 3000 proteins (751,860 amino acids) with 15 enzymes and three miscleavages for each enzyme, and only a few seconds for single enzyme digestion. Obviously, the tool identified more bioactive peptides than that of the benchmarked tool; an example of validated pentapeptide (FLPIL) from LC-MS/MS was demonstrated.

25150822,LRRsearch: An asynchronous server-based application for the prediction of leucine-rich repeat motifs and an integrative database of NOD-like receptors.,"The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain like receptors (NLRs) play key roles in recognizing and binding various pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) resulting in the activation of downstream signaling and innate immunity. Therefore, identification of LRR motifs is very important to study ligand-receptor interaction. To date, available resources pose restrictions including both false negative and false positive prediction of LRR motifs from the primary protein sequence as their algorithms are relied either only on sequence based comparison or alignment techniques or are over biased for a particular LRR containing protein family. Therefore, to minimize the error (≤5%) and to identify a maximum number of LRR motifs in the wide range of proteins, we have developed ""LRRsearch"" web-server using position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of 11 residue LRR-HCS (highly conserved segment) which are frequently observed motifs in the most divergent classes of LRR containing proteins. A data library of 421 proteins, distributed among five known NLR families has also been integrated with the ""LRRsearch"" for the rich user experience.

22747501,PePPER: a webserver for prediction of prokaryote promoter elements and regulons.,"<h4>Background</h4>Accurate prediction of DNA motifs that are targets of RNA polymerases, sigma factors and transcription factors (TFs) in prokaryotes is a difficult mission mainly due to as yet undiscovered features in DNA sequences or structures in promoter regions. Improved prediction and comparison algorithms are currently available for identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and their accompanying TFs and regulon members.<h4>Results</h4>We here extend the current databases of TFs, TFBSs and regulons with our knowledge on Lactococcus lactis and developed a webserver for prediction, mining and visualization of prokaryote promoter elements and regulons via a novel concept. This new approach includes an all-in-one method of data mining for TFs, TFBSs, promoters, and regulons for any bacterial genome via a user-friendly webserver. We demonstrate the power of this method by mining WalRK regulons in Lactococci and Streptococci and, vice versa, use L. lactis regulon data (CodY) to mine closely related species.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PePPER webserver offers, besides the all-in-one analysis method, a toolbox for mining for regulons, promoters and TFBSs and accommodates a new L. lactis regulon database in addition to already existing regulon data. Identification of putative regulons and full annotation of intergenic regions in any bacterial genome on the basis of existing knowledge on a related organism can now be performed by biologists and it can be done for a wide range of regulons.

Some user-friendly tools already perform this analysis on precompiled databases of abstracts of scientific papers. Other tools allow expert users to elaborate and analyze the full content of a corpus of scientific documents. However, to our knowledge, no user friendly tool that simultaneously analyzes the latest set of scientific documents available on line and reconstructs the set of genes referenced in those documents is available.<h4>Results</h4>This article presents such a tool, Biblio-MetReS, and compares its functioning and results to those of other user-friendly applications (iHOP, STRING) that are widely used. Under similar conditions, Biblio-MetReS creates networks that are comparable to those of other user friendly tools. Furthermore, analysis of full text documents provides more complete reconstructions than those that result from using only the abstract of the document.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Literature-based automated network reconstruction is still far from providing complete reconstructions of molecular networks. However, its value as an auxiliary tool is high and it will increase as standards for reporting biological entities and relationships become more widely accepted and enforced.

30367585,Arena-Idb: a platform to build human non-coding RNA interaction networks.,"<h4>Background</h4>High throughput technologies have provided the scientific community an unprecedented opportunity for large-scale analysis of genomes. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), for a long time believed to be non-functional, are emerging as one of the most important and large family of gene regulators and key elements for genome maintenance. Functional studies have been able to assign to ncRNAs a wide spectrum of functions in primary biological processes, and for this reason they are assuming a growing importance as a potential new family of cancer therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, the number of functionally characterized ncRNAs is still too poor if compared to the number of new discovered ncRNAs. Thus platforms able to merge information from available resources addressing data integration issues are necessary and still insufficient to elucidate ncRNAs biological roles.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we describe a platform called Arena-Idb for the retrieval of comprehensive and non-redundant annotated ncRNAs interactions. Arena-Idb provides a framework for network reconstruction of ncRNA heterogeneous interactions (i.e., with other type of molecules) and relationships with human diseases which guide the integration of data, extracted from different sources, via mapping of entities and minimization of ambiguity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Arena-Idb provides a schema and a visualization system to integrate ncRNA interactions that assists in discovering ncRNA functions through the extraction of heterogeneous interaction networks.

The identification of gene-gene interactions may be inferred from gene expression information but such meta-analysis is often limited to a single microarray platform. To address this limitation, we developed a gene-centered approach to analyze differential expression across thousands of gene expression experiments and created the CO-Regulation Database (CORD) to determine which genes are correlated with a queried gene.<h4>Results</h4>Using the GEO and ArrayExpress database, we analyzed over 120,000 group by group experiments from gene microarrays to determine the correlating genes for over 30,000 different genes or hypothesized genes. CORD output data is presented for sample queries with focus on genes with well-known interaction networks including p16 (CDKN2A), vimentin (VIM), MyoD (MYOD1). CDKN2A, VIM, and MYOD1 all displayed gene correlations consistent with known interacting genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a facile, web-enabled program to determine gene-gene correlations across different gene expression microarray platforms.

23323735,SyntTax: a web server linking synteny to prokaryotic taxonomy.,"<h4>Background</h4>The study of the conservation of gene order or synteny constitutes a powerful methodology to assess the orthology of genomic regions and to predict functional relationships between genes. The exponential growth of microbial genomic databases is expected to improve synteny predictions significantly. Paradoxically, this genomic data plethora, without information on organisms relatedness, could impair the performance of synteny analysis programs.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, I present SyntTax, a synteny web service designed to take full advantage of the large amount or archaeal and bacterial genomes by linking them through taxonomic relationships. SyntTax incorporates a full hierarchical taxonomic tree allowing intuitive access to all completely sequenced prokaryotes. Single or multiple organisms can be chosen on the basis of their lineage by selecting the corresponding rank nodes in the tree. The synteny methodology is built upon our previously described Absynte algorithm with several additional improvements.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SyntTax aims to produce robust syntenies by providing prompt access to the taxonomic relationships connecting all completely sequenced microbial genomes. The reduction in redundancy offered by lineage selection presents the benefit of increasing accuracy while reducing computation time. This web tool was used to resolve successfully several conserved complex gene clusters described in the literature. In addition, particular features of SyntTax permit the confirmation of the involvement of the four components constituting the E. coli YgjD multiprotein complex responsible for tRNA modification.

UniRule uses protein family signatures from InterPro, combined with taxonomic and other constraints, to select sets of reviewed proteins which have common functional properties supported by experimental evidence. This annotation is propagated to unreviewed records in UniProtKB that meet the same selection criteria, most of which do not have (and are never likely to have) experimentally verified functional annotation. Release 2020_01 of UniProtKB contains 6496 UniRule rules which provide annotation for 53 million proteins, accounting for 30% of the 178 million records in UniProtKB. UniRule provides scalable enrichment of annotation in UniProtKB.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>UniRule rules are integrated into UniProtKB and can be viewed at https://www.uniprot.org/unirule/. UniRule rules and the code required to run the rules, are publicly available for researchers who wish to annotate their own sequences.

28203233,Exo-miRExplorer: A Comprehensive Resource for Exploring and Comparatively Analyzing Exogenous MicroRNAs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that play important roles in animals, plants, and viruses. Deep-sequencing technology has been widely adopted in miRNA investigations. However, it is still a big mysterious why nearly all sequencing data contain miRNA sequences from exogenous species, called exo-miRNAs. In this study, we developed a novel platform, exo-miRExplorer, for mining and identifying exo-miRNAs from high-throughput small RNA sequencing experiments which originated from tissues and cell lines of multiple organisms. Thousands of exo-miRNAs are characterized with their expression abundance, the RNA families, original organisms and the sequencing platforms presented in exo-miRExplorer. Subsequently, we used exo-miRExplorer to perform further analysis. Comparative analysis of the exo-miRNAs between different sequencing datasets revealed significant correlation of exo-miRNAs between experiments in the same study. The plant-derived exo-miRNAs analysis provided robust evidence for non-diet source of exo-miRNAs. Virus-derived exo-miRNA analysis showed that pathogen RNAs could transfer to host cells and exist in deep-sequencing result at abundance level.

22879444,Phenol-Explorer 2.0: a major update of the Phenol-Explorer database integrating data on polyphenol metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans and experimental animals.,"Phenol-Explorer, launched in 2009, is the only comprehensive web-based database on the content in foods of polyphenols, a major class of food bioactives that receive considerable attention due to their role in the prevention of diseases. Polyphenols are rarely absorbed and excreted in their ingested forms, but extensively metabolized in the body, and until now, no database has allowed the recall of identities and concentrations of polyphenol metabolites in biofluids after the consumption of polyphenol-rich sources. Knowledge of these metabolites is essential in the planning of experiments whose aim is to elucidate the effects of polyphenols on health. Release 2.0 is the first major update of the database, allowing the rapid retrieval of data on the biotransformations and pharmacokinetics of dietary polyphenols. Data on 375 polyphenol metabolites identified in urine and plasma were collected from 236 peer-reviewed publications on polyphenol metabolism in humans and experimental animals and added to the database by means of an extended relational design. Pharmacokinetic parameters have been collected and can be retrieved in both tabular and graphical form. The web interface has been enhanced and now allows the filtering of information according to various criteria. Phenol-Explorer 2.0, which will be periodically updated, should prove to be an even more useful and capable resource for polyphenol scientists because bioactivities and health effects of polyphenols are dependent on the nature and concentrations of metabolites reaching the target tissues.

21666259,PAComplex: a web server to infer peptide antigen families and binding models from TCR-pMHC complexes.,"One of the most adaptive immune responses is triggered by specific T-cell receptors (TCR) binding to peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC). Despite the availability of many prediction servers to identify peptides binding to MHC, these servers are often lacking in peptide-TCR interactions and detailed atomic interacting models. PAComplex is the first web server investigating both pMHC and peptide-TCR interfaces to infer peptide antigens and homologous peptide antigens of a query. This server first identifies significantly similar TCR-pMHC templates (joint Z-value ≥ 4.0) of the query by using antibody-antigen and protein-protein interacting scoring matrices for peptide-TCR and pMHC interfaces, respectively. PAComplex then identifies the homologous peptide antigens of these hit templates from complete pathogen genome databases (≥10(8) peptide candidates from 864,628 protein sequences of 389 pathogens) and experimental peptide databases (80,057 peptides in 2287 species). Finally, the server outputs peptide antigens and homologous peptide antigens of the query and displays detailed interacting models (e.g. hydrogen bonds and steric interactions in two interfaces) of hitTCR-pMHC templates. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed server can achieve high prediction accuracy and offer potential peptide antigens across pathogens. We believe that the server is able to provide valuable insights for the peptide vaccine and MHC restriction.

33175872,High density genotype storage for plant breeding in the Chado schema of Breedbase.,"Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder's informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF. JSONb is both compressed and indexed, resulting in a space and time efficient system. Furthermore, file caching maximizes data retrieval performance. Integration of all breeding data within the Chado database schema retains referential integrity that may be lost when genotyping and phenotyping data are stored in separate systems. Benchmarking demonstrates that the system is fast enough for computation of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) and genome wide association study (GWAS) for datasets involving 1,325 diploid Zea mays, 314 triploid Musa acuminata, and 924 diploid Manihot esculenta samples genotyped with 955,690, 142,119, and 287,952 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers, respectively.",True,False,4.0,,breedbase,,19.98654026,ok,,,,v2,0.98654026,,True,False,False,,https://breedbase.org/,https://breedbase.org/,True,...ents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-...,1

23630321,The RNAsnp web server: predicting SNP effects on local RNA secondary structure.,"The function of many non-coding RNA genes and cis-regulatory elements of messenger RNA largely depends on the structure, which is in turn determined by their sequence. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other mutations may disrupt the RNA structure, interfere with the molecular function and hence cause a phenotypic effect. RNAsnp is an efficient method to predict the effect of SNPs on local RNA secondary structure based on the RNA folding algorithms implemented in the Vienna RNA package. The SNP effects are quantified in terms of empirical P-values, which, for computational efficiency, are derived from extensive pre-computed tables of distributions of substitution effects as a function of gene length and GC content. Here, we present a web service that not only provides an interface for RNAsnp but also features a graphical output representation. In addition, the web server is connected to a local mirror of the UCSC genome browser database that enables the users to select the genomic sequences for analysis and visualize the results directly in the UCSC genome browser.

25887597,ColoWeb: a resource for analysis of colocalization of genomic features.,"<h4>Background</h4>Next-generation sequencing techniques such as ChIP-seq allow researchers to investigate the genomic position of nuclear components and events. These experiments provide researchers with thousands of regions of interest to probe in order to identify biological relevance. As the cost of sequencing decreases and its robustness increases, more and more researchers turn to genome-wide studies to better understand the genomic elements they are studying. One way to interpret the output of sequencing studies is to investigate how the element of interest localizes in relationship to genome annotations and the binding of other nuclear components. Colocalization of genomic features could indicate cooperation and provide evidence for more detailed investigations. Although there are several existing tools for visualizing and analyzing colocalization, either they are difficult to use for experimental researchers, not well maintained, or without measurements for colocalization strength. Here we describe an online tool, ColoWeb, designed to allow experimentalists to compare their datasets to existing genomic features in order to generate hypotheses about biological interactions easily and quickly.<h4>Results</h4>ColoWeb is a web-based service for evaluating the colocation of genomic features. Users submit genomic regions of interest, for example, a set of locations from a ChIP-seq analysis. ColoWeb compares the submitted regions of interest to the location of other genomic features such as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. To facilitate comparisons among various genomic features, the output consists of both graphical representations and quantitative measures of the degree of colocalization between user's genomic regions and selected features. Frequent colocation may indicate a biological relationship.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ColoWeb is a biologist-friendly web service that can quickly provide an assessment of thousands of genomic regions to identify colocated genomic features.

The server takes as input either several sequences or 3D structures of proteins known to interact. It returns a set of 10 consensus candidate complexes, together with interface predictions to guide further experimental validation interactively. Three key novelties were implemented in InterEvDock3 to help obtain more reliable models: users can (i) generate template-based structural models of assemblies using close and remote homologs of known 3D structure, detected through an automated search protocol, (ii) select the assembly models most consistent with contact maps from external methods that implement covariation-based contact prediction with or without deep learning and (iii) exploit a novel coevolution-based scoring scheme at atomic level, which leads to significantly higher free docking success rates. The performance of the server was validated on two large free docking benchmark databases, containing respectively 230 unbound targets (Weng dataset) and 812 models of unbound targets (PPI4DOCK dataset).

Combinational analysis of high-throughput 'multi-omics' datasets (gathering information from genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and pharmacogenomics), at either populational or single-cell levels, can provide a multi-dimensional, integrated profile of the heterogeneous aging process with unprecedented throughput and detail. These new strategies allow for the exploration of the molecular profile and regulatory status of gene expression during aging, and in turn, facilitate the development of new aging interventions. With a continually growing volume of valuable aging-related data, it is necessary to establish an open and integrated database to support a wide spectrum of aging research.

23800136,MetaPathways: a modular pipeline for constructing pathway/genome databases from environmental sequence information.,"<h4>Background</h4>A central challenge to understanding the ecological and biogeochemical roles of microorganisms in natural and human engineered ecosystems is the reconstruction of metabolic interaction networks from environmental sequence information. The dominant paradigm in metabolic reconstruction is to assign functional annotations using BLAST. Functional annotations are then projected onto symbolic representations of metabolism in the form of KEGG pathways or SEED subsystems.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present MetaPathways, an open source pipeline for pathway inference that uses the PathoLogic algorithm to map functional annotations onto the MetaCyc collection of reactions and pathways, and construct environmental Pathway/Genome Databases (ePGDBs) compatible with the editing and navigation features of Pathway Tools. The pipeline accepts assembled or unassembled nucleotide sequences, performs quality assessment and control, predicts and annotates noncoding genes and open reading frames, and produces inputs to PathoLogic. In addition to constructing ePGDBs, MetaPathways uses MLTreeMap to build phylogenetic trees for selected taxonomic anchor and functional gene markers, converts General Feature Format (GFF) files into concatenated GenBank files for ePGDB construction based on third-party annotations, and generates useful file formats including Sequin files for direct GenBank submission and gene feature tables summarizing annotations, MLTreeMap trees, and ePGDB pathway coverage summaries for statistical comparisons.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MetaPathways provides users with a modular annotation and analysis pipeline for predicting metabolic interaction networks from environmental sequence information using an alternative to KEGG pathways and SEED subsystems mapping. It is extensible to genomic and transcriptomic datasets from a wide range of sequencing platforms, and generates useful data products for microbial community structure and function analysis.

Over the last decades, several methodologies have been developed to predict such structures or to use them to functionally annotate RNAs into RNA families. However, to fully perform this analysis, researchers should utilize multiple tools, which require the constant parsing and processing of several intermediate files. This makes the large-scale prediction and annotation of RNAs a daunting task even to researchers with good computational or bioinformatics skills.<h4>Results</h4>We present an automated pipeline named StructRNAfinder that predicts and annotates RNA families in transcript or genome sequences. This single tool not only displays the sequence/structural consensus alignments for each RNA family, according to Rfam database but also provides a taxonomic overview for each assigned functional RNA.

31131411,PatchSearch: a web server for off-target protein identification.,"The large number of proteins found in the human body implies that a drug may interact with many proteins, called off-target proteins, besides its intended target. The PatchSearch web server provides an automated workflow that allows users to identify structurally conserved binding sites at the protein surfaces in a set of user-supplied protein structures. Thus, this web server may help to detect potential off-target protein. It takes as input a protein complexed with a ligand and identifies within user-defined or predefined collections of protein structures, those having a binding site compatible with this ligand in terms of geometry and physicochemical properties. It is based on a non-sequential local alignment of the patch over the entire protein surface. Then the PatchSearch web server proposes a ligand binding mode for the potential off-target, as well as an estimated affinity calculated by the Vinardo scoring function. This novel tool is able to efficiently detects potential interactions of ligands with distant off-target proteins. Furthermore, by facilitating the discovery of unexpected off-targets, PatchSearch could contribute to the repurposing of existing drugs.

34418956,airpg: automatically accessing the inverted repeats of archived plastid genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>In most flowering plants, the plastid genome exhibits a quadripartite genome structure, comprising a large and a small single copy as well as two inverted repeat regions. Thousands of plastid genomes have been sequenced and submitted to public sequence repositories in recent years. The quality of sequence annotations in many of these submissions is known to be problematic, especially regarding annotations that specify the length and location of the inverted repeats: such annotations are either missing or portray the length or location of the repeats incorrectly. However, many biological investigations employ publicly available plastid genomes at face value and implicitly assume the correctness of their sequence annotations.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce airpg, a Python package that automatically assesses the frequency of incomplete or incorrect annotations of the inverted repeats among publicly available plastid genomes. Specifically, the tool automatically retrieves plastid genomes from NCBI Nucleotide under variable search parameters, surveys them for length and location specifications of inverted repeats, and confirms any inverted repeat annotations through self-comparisons of the genome sequences. The package also includes functionality for automatic identification and removal of duplicate genome records and accounts for taxa that genuinely lack inverted repeats. A survey of the presence of inverted repeat annotations among all plastid genomes of flowering plants submitted to NCBI Nucleotide until the end of 2020 using airpg, followed by a statistical analysis of potential associations with record metadata, highlights that release year and publication status of the genome records have a significant effect on the frequency of complete and equal-length inverted repeat annotations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The number of plastid genomes on NCBI Nucleotide has increased dramatically in recent years, and many more genomes will likely be submitted over the next decade. airpg enables researchers to automatically access and evaluate the inverted repeats of these plastid genomes as well as their sequence annotations and, thus, contributes to increasing the reliability of publicly available plastid genomes.

While several gene atlas available online as pre-computed databases for known gene models, it's still challenging to get expression profile for previously uncharacterized (i.e. novel) transcripts efficiently.<h4>Results</h4>Here we developed LocExpress, a web server for efficiently estimating expression of novel transcripts across multiple tissues and cell types in human (20 normal tissues/cells types and 14 cell lines) as well as in mouse (24 normal tissues/cell types and nine cell lines). As a wrapper to RNA-Seq quantification algorithm, LocExpress efficiently reduces the time cost by making abundance estimation calls increasingly within the minimum spanning bundle region of input transcripts. For a given novel gene model, such local context-oriented strategy allows LocExpress to estimate its FPKMs in hundreds of samples within minutes on a standard Linux box, making an online web server possible.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To the best of our knowledge, LocExpress is the only web server to provide nearly real-time expression estimation for novel transcripts in common tissues and cell types.

MultitaskProtDB-II is a database of multifunctional proteins that has been updated. In the previous version, the information contained was: NCBI and UniProt accession numbers, canonical and additional biological functions, organism, monomeric/oligomeric states, PDB codes and bibliographic references. In the present update, the number of entries has been increased from 288 to 694 moonlighting proteins. MultitaskProtDB-II is continually being curated and updated. The new database also contains the following information: GO descriptors for the canonical and moonlighting functions, three-dimensional structure (for those proteins lacking PDB structure, a model was made using Itasser and Phyre), the involvement of the proteins in human diseases (78% of human moonlighting proteins) and whether the protein is a target of a current drug (48% of human moonlighting proteins). These numbers highlight the importance of these proteins for the analysis and explanation of human diseases and target-directed drug design. Moreover, 25% of the proteins of the database are involved in virulence of pathogenic microorganisms, largely in the mechanism of adhesion to the host.

26989149,R-Syst::diatom: an open-access and curated barcode database for diatoms and freshwater monitoring.,"Diatoms are micro-algal indicators of freshwater pollution. Current standardized methodologies are based on microscopic determinations, which is time consuming and prone to identification uncertainties. The use of DNA-barcoding has been proposed as a way to avoid these flaws. Combining barcoding with next-generation sequencing enables collection of a large quantity of barcodes from natural samples. These barcodes are identified as certain diatom taxa by comparing the sequences to a reference barcoding library using algorithms. Proof of concept was recently demonstrated for synthetic and natural communities and underlined the importance of the quality of this reference library. We present an open-access and curated reference barcoding database for diatoms, called R-Syst::diatom, developed in the framework of R-Syst, the network of systematic supported by INRA (French National Institute for Agricultural Research), see http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/en. R-Syst::diatom links DNA-barcodes to their taxonomical identifications, and is dedicated to identify barcodes from natural samples. The data come from two sources, a culture collection of freshwater algae maintained in INRA in which new strains are regularly deposited and barcoded and from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) nucleotide database. Two kinds of barcodes were chosen to support the database: 18S (18S ribosomal RNA) and rbcL (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), because of their efficiency. Data are curated using innovative (Declic) and classical bioinformatic tools (Blast, classical phylogenies) and up-to-date taxonomy (Catalogues and peer reviewed papers). Every 6 months R-Syst::diatom is updated. The database is available through the R-Syst microalgae website (http://www.rsyst.inra.fr/) and a platform dedicated to next-generation sequencing data analysis, virtual_BiodiversityL@b (https://galaxy-pgtp.pierroton.inra.fr/). We present here the content of the library regarding the number of barcodes and diatom taxa. In addition to these information, morphological features (e.g. biovolumes, chloroplasts…), life-forms (mobility, colony-type) or ecological features (taxa preferenda to pollution) are indicated in R-Syst::diatom.

Evidence increasingly demonstrates its crucial importance in essential molecular mechanisms and various diseases. With recent advances in sequencing techniques, tens of thousands of m6A sites are identified in a typical high-throughput experiment, posing a key challenge to distinguish the functional m6A sites from the remaining 'passenger' (or 'silent') sites. Results: We performed a comparative conservation analysis of the human and mouse m6A epitranscriptomes at single site resolution. A novel scoring framework, ConsRM, was devised to quantitatively measure the degree of conservation of individual m6A sites. ConsRM integrates multiple information sources and a positive-unlabeled learning framework, which integrated genomic and sequence features to trace subtle hints of epitranscriptome layer conservation. With a series validation experiments in mouse, fly and zebrafish, we showed that ConsRM outperformed well-adopted conservation scores (phastCons and phyloP) in distinguishing the conserved and unconserved m6A sites. Additionally, the m6A sites with a higher ConsRM score are more likely to be functionally important. An online database was developed containing the conservation metrics of 177 998 distinct human m6A sites to support conservation analysis and functional prioritization of individual m6A sites.

Numerous experiments elucidated binding sequences which subsequently have been used to derive statistical models for predicting potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). The rapidly increasing number of genome sequence data requires sophisticated computational approaches to manage and query experimental and predicted TFBS data in the context of other epigenetic factors and across different organisms.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed D-Light, a novel client-server software package to store and query large amounts of TFBS data for any number of genomes.

The relational scheme of PICKLE 3.0 has been amended to exploit the Mouse Genome Informatics mouse-human ortholog gene pair collection, enabling (i) the extension through orthology of the mouse interactome with potentially valid PPIs between mouse entities based on the experimental PPIs between mouse and human entities and (ii) the comparison between mouse and human PPI networks. Interestingly, 43.5% of the experimental mouse PPIs lacks a corresponding by orthology PPI in human, an inconsistency in need of further investigation. Overall, as primary mouse PPI datasets show a considerably limited overlap, PICKLE 3.0 provides a unique comprehensive representation of the mouse protein interactome.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PICKLE can be queried and downloaded at http://www.pickle.gr.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,,pickle,19.89624506,ok,,mouse genome informatics,,v2,0.89624506,PICKLE,True,True,True,,http://www.pickle.gr,http://www.pickle.gr,True,...ation</h4>PICKLE can be queried and downloaded at http://www.pickle.gr.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
27612452,"Mergeomics: a web server for identifying pathological pathways, networks, and key regulators via multidimensional data integration.","<h4>Background</h4>Human diseases are commonly the result of multidimensional changes at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels. Recent advances in genomic technologies have enabled an outpour of omics datasets that capture these changes. However, separate analyses of these various data only provide fragmented understanding and do not capture the holistic view of disease mechanisms. To meet the urgent needs for tools that effectively integrate multiple types of omics data to derive biological insights, we have developed Mergeomics, a computational pipeline that integrates multidimensional disease association data with functional genomics and molecular networks to retrieve biological pathways, gene networks, and central regulators critical for disease development.<h4>Results</h4>To make the Mergeomics pipeline available to a wider research community, we have implemented an online, user-friendly web server ( http://mergeomics.<h4>Research</h4>idre.ucla.edu/ ). The web server features a modular implementation of the Mergeomics pipeline with detailed tutorials. Additionally, it provides curated genomic resources including tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci, ENCODE functional annotations, biological pathways, and molecular networks, and offers interactive visualization of analytical results. Multiple computational tools including Marker Dependency Filtering (MDF), Marker Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA), Meta-MSEA, and Weighted Key Driver Analysis (wKDA) can be used separately or in flexible combinations. User-defined summary-level genomic association datasets (e.g., genetic, transcriptomic, epigenomic) related to a particular disease or phenotype can be uploaded and computed real-time to yield biologically interpretable results, which can be viewed online and downloaded for later use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our Mergeomics web server offers researchers flexible and user-friendly tools to facilitate integration of multidimensional data into holistic views of disease mechanisms in the form of tissue-specific key regulators, biological pathways, and gene networks.",True,False,7.0,,mergeomics,,19.8954103,ok,,,encode,v2,0.8954103,Mergeomics,True,True,True,,http://mergeomics,http://mergeomics,True,"...implemented an online, user-friendly web server ( http://mergeomics.<h4>Research</h4>idre.ucla.edu/ ).

Nevertheless, most related tools available are not user-friendly, present redundant information, do not clearly display the data, and usually are specific for particular biological activities, not existing so far, an integrated database with consolidated information to help research peptide sequences. To solve these necessities, we developed Peptipedia, a user-friendly web application and comprehensive database to search, characterize and analyse peptide sequences. Our tool integrates the information from 30 previously reported databases with a total of 92 055 amino acid sequences, making it the biggest repository of peptides with recorded activities to date. Furthermore, we make available a variety of bioinformatics services and statistical modules to increase our tool's usability. Moreover, we incorporated a robust assembled binary classification system to predict putative biological activities for peptide sequences. Our tools' significant differences with other existing alternatives become a substantial contribution for developing biotechnological and bioengineering applications for peptides.

Bioinformatics prediction and small RNA (sRNA) cloning are the most important approaches for identification of miRNAs and tasiRNAs and their targets. However, these approaches are not readily accessible to every researcher. Here we present SoMART, a web server for miRNA/tasiRNA analysis resources and tools, which is designed for researchers who are interested in identifying miRNAs or tasiRNAs that potentially regulate genes of interest. The server includes four sets of tools: 'Slicer detector' for detecting sRNAs targeting input genes, 'dRNA mapper' for detecting degradome (d)RNA products derived from input genes, 'PreMIR detector' for identifying miRNA precursors (MIRs) or tasiRNA precursor (TASs) of input sRNAs, and 'sRNA mapper' for mapping sRNAs onto input genes. We also developed a dRNA-seq protocol to achieve longer dRNA reads for better characterization of miRNA precursors by dRNA mapper. To validate the server function and robustness, we installed sRNA, dRNA and collected genomic DNA or transcriptome databases from Arabidopsis and solanaceous plants, and characterized miR172-mediated regulation of the APETALA2 gene in potato (Solanum tuberosum) and demonstrated conservation of MIR390-triggered TAS3 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). More importantly, we predicted the existence of MIR482-triggered TAS5 in tomato.

Computational methods are effective approaches to reduce the number of safety issues by analyzing possible links between chemical structures and ADMET or adverse effects, but this is limited by the size, quality, and heterogeneity of the data available from individual sources. Thus, large, clean and integrated databases of approved drug data, associated with fast and efficient predictive tools are desirable early in the drug discovery process.<h4>Description</h4>We have built a relational database (IDAAPM) to integrate available approved drug data such as drug approval information, ADMET and adverse effects, chemical structures and molecular descriptors, targets, bioactivity and related references. The database has been coupled with a searchable web interface and modern data analytics platform (KNIME) to allow data access, data transformation, initial analysis and further predictive modeling. Data were extracted from FDA resources and supplemented from other publicly available databases. Currently, the database contains information regarding about 19,226 FDA approval applications for 31,815 products (small molecules and biologics) with their approval history, 2505 active ingredients, together with as many ADMET properties, 1629 molecular structures, 2.5 million adverse effects and 36,963 experimental drug-target bioactivity data.<h4>Conclusion</h4>IDAAPM is a unique resource that, in a single relational database, provides detailed information on FDA approved drugs including their ADMET properties and adverse effects, the corresponding targets with bioactivity data, coupled with a data analytics platform.

However, when analyzing these data, scientists are often left holding disparate biological currency-molecular identifiers from different databases. For downstream applications that require converting the identifiers themselves, there are many resources available, but analyzing associated loci and variants can be cumbersome if data is not given in a form amenable to particular analyses. Here we present BISQUE, a web server and customizable command-line tool for converting molecular identifiers and their contained loci and variants between different database conventions.

29943074,ADMETlab: a platform for systematic ADMET evaluation based on a comprehensively collected ADMET database.,"Current pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) is a high-risk investment which is usually faced with some unexpected even disastrous failures in different stages of drug discovery. One main reason for R&D failures is the efficacy and safety deficiencies which are related largely to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties and various toxicities (T). Therefore, rapid ADMET evaluation is urgently needed to minimize failures in the drug discovery process. Here, we developed a web-based platform called ADMETlab for systematic ADMET evaluation of chemicals based on a comprehensively collected ADMET database consisting of 288,967 entries. Four function modules in the platform enable users to conveniently perform six types of drug-likeness analysis (five rules and one prediction model), 31 ADMET endpoints prediction (basic property: 3, absorption: 6, distribution: 3, metabolism: 10, elimination: 2, toxicity: 7), systematic evaluation and database/similarity searching. We believe that this web platform will hopefully facilitate the drug discovery process by enabling early drug-likeness evaluation, rapid ADMET virtual screening or filtering and prioritization of chemical structures.

24816342,dbCRY: a Web-based comparative and evolutionary genomics platform for blue-light receptors.,"Cryptochromes are flavoproteins that play a central role in the circadian oscillations of all living organisms except archaea. Cryptochromes are clustered into three subfamilies: plant-type cryptochromes, animal-type cryptochromes and cryptochrome-DASH proteins. These subfamilies are composed of photolyase/cryptochrome superfamily with 6-4 photolyase and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase. Cryptochromes have conserved domain architectures with two distinct domains, an N-terminal photolyase-related domain and a C-terminal domain. Although the molecular function and domain architecture of cryptochromes are conserved, their molecular mechanisms differ between plants and animals. Thus, cryptochromes are one of the best candidates for comparative and evolutionary studies. Here, we have developed a Web-based platform for comparative and evolutionary studies of cryptochromes, dbCRY (http://www.dbcryptochrome.org/). A pipeline built upon the consensus domain profile was applied to 1438 genomes and identified 1309 genes.

Importantly, the ratings demonstrate that, notwithstanding their visual simplicity, the images represent a wide range of affective content (from very negative to very positive, and from very calm to very intense). In addition, speaking to their cultural neutrality, the valence ratings correlated very highly between US and Chinese ratings. Arousal ratings were less consistent between the two samples, with larger discrepancies in the older age groups inviting further investigation.

A comprehensive catalog of tumor gene-response outcomes from individual patients is needed, especially for actionable mutations and rare variants. We created a proof-of-principle database [DNA-mutation Inventory to Refine and Enhance Cancer Treatment (DIRECT)], starting with lung cancer-associated EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations, to provide a resource for clinicians to prioritize treatment decisions based on a patient's tumor mutations at the point of care.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search of literature published between June 2005 and May 2011 was conducted through PubMed to identify patient-level, mutation-drug response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutant tumors. Minimum inclusion criteria included patient's EGFR mutation, corresponding treatment, and an associated radiographic outcome.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1,021 patients with 1,070 separate EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy responses from 116 different publications were included. About 188 unique EGFR mutations occurring in 207 different combinations were identified: 149 different mutation combinations were associated with disease control and 42 were associated with disease progression. Four secondary mutations, in 16 different combinations, were associated with acquired resistance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As tumor sequencing becomes more common in oncology, this comprehensive electronic catalog can enable genome-directed anticancer therapy.

Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimize rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterizations of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 1400 published/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 as well as other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. It contains relevant metadata including evidence of cross-neutralization, antibody/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models and source literature.<h4>Results</h4>On August 5, 2020, CoV-AbDab referenced sequence information on 1402 anti-coronavirus antibodies and nanobodies, spanning 66 papers and 21 patents.

33464891,TopSuite Web Server: A Meta-Suite for Deep-Learning-Based Protein Structure and Quality Prediction.,"Proteins carry out the most fundamental processes of life such as cellular metabolism, regulation, and communication. Understanding these processes at a molecular level requires knowledge of their three-dimensional structures. Experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy can resolve protein structures but are costly and time-consuming and do not work for all proteins. Computational protein structure prediction tries to overcome these problems by predicting the structure of a new protein using existing protein structures as a resource. Here we present TopSuite, a web server for protein model quality assessment (TopScore) and template-based protein structure prediction (TopModel). TopScore provides meta-predictions for global and residue-wise model quality estimation using deep neural networks.

Mining of such spatiotemporally expressed genes using large-scale gene expression data derived from a broad range of experimental sources facilitates our understanding of genome-scale functional gene networks. However, comprehensive information on spatiotemporally expressed genes is lacking in plants. To collect such information, we devised a new index, Δdmax, which is the maximum difference in relative gene expression levels between sample runs which are neighboring when sorted by the levels. Employing this index, we comprehensively evaluated transcripts using large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data stored in the Sequence Read Archive for eight plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), Solanum tuberosum (potato), Oryza sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum), Vitis vinifera (grape), Medicago truncatula (Medicago), and Glycine max (soybean).

Previous work that attempted to devise objective methods to model mental workload were mainly based on neurological or physiological data collected when the participants performed tasks that did not involve physical activity. While such models may be useful for scenarios that involve static operators, they may not apply in real-world situations where operators are performing tasks under varying levels of physical activity, such as those faced by first responders, firefighters, and police officers. Here, we describe WAUC, a multimodal database of mental Workload Assessment Under physical aCtivity. The study involved 48 participants who performed the NASA Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery II under three different activity level conditions. Physical activity was manipulated by changing the speed of a stationary bike or a treadmill. During data collection, six neural and physiological modalities were recorded, namely: electroencephalography, electrocardiography, breathing rate, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and blood volume pulse, in addition to 3-axis accelerometry. Moreover, participants were asked to answer the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire after each experimental section, as well as rate their physical fatigue level on the Borg fatigue scale. In order to bring our experimental setup closer to real-world situations, all signals were monitored using wearable, off-the-shelf devices.

Next-generation sequencing methods produce ample reads, but they are short, currently ∼100-450 nt (depending on the technology), as compared to the full rRNA gene of ∼1550 nt. It is important, therefore, to select the right rRNA gene region for sequencing. The primers should amplify the species of interest and the hypervariable regions should differentiate their taxonomy. Here, we introduce TaxMan: a web-based tool that trims reference sequences based on user-selected primer pairs and returns an assessment of the primer specificity by taxa. It allows interactive plotting of taxa, both amplified and missed in silico by the primers used. Additionally, using the trimmed sequences improves the speed of sequence matching algorithms. The smaller database greatly improves run times (up to 98%) and memory usage, not only of similarity searching (BLAST), but also of chimera checking (UCHIME) and of clustering the reads (UCLUST).

28916823,Digging into the low molecular weight peptidome with the OligoNet web server.,"Bioactive peptides play critical roles in regulating many biological processes. Recently, natural short peptides biomarkers are drawing significant attention and are considered as ""hidden treasure"" of drug candidates. High resolution and high mass accuracy provided by mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics would enable the rapid detection and wide coverage of the low-molecular-weight peptidome. However, translating unknown masses (<1 500 Da) into putative peptides is often limited due to the lack of automatic data processing tools and to the limit of peptide databases. The web server OligoNet responds to this challenge by attempting to decompose each individual mass into a combination of amino acids out of metabolomics datasets. It provides an additional network-based data interpretation named ""Peptide degradation network"" (PDN), which unravels interesting relations between annotated peptides and generates potential functional patterns. The ab initio PDN built from yeast metabolic profiling data shows a great similarity with well-known metabolic networks, and could aid biological interpretation.

34388468,ChAlPred: A web server for prediction of allergenicity of chemical compounds.,"<h4>Background</h4>Allergy is the abrupt reaction of the immune system that may occur after the exposure to allergens such as proteins, peptides, or chemicals. In the past, various methods have been generated for predicting allergenicity of proteins and peptides. In contrast, there is no method that can predict allergenic potential of chemicals. In this paper, we described a method ChAlPred developed for predicting chemical allergens as well as for designing chemical analogs with desired allergenicity.<h4>Method</h4>In this study, we have used 403 allergenic and 1074 non-allergenic chemical compounds obtained from IEDB database. The PaDEL software was used to compute the molecular descriptors of the chemical compounds to develop different prediction models. All the models were trained and tested on the 80% training data and evaluated on the 20% validation data using the 2D, 3D and FP descriptors.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we have developed different prediction models using several machine learning approaches. It was observed that the Random Forest based model developed using hybrid descriptors performed the best, and achieved the maximum accuracy of 83.39% and AUC of 0.93 on validation dataset. The fingerprint analysis of the dataset indicates that certain chemical fingerprints are more abundant in allergens that include PubChemFP129 and GraphFP1014. We have also predicted allergenicity potential of FDA-approved drugs using our best model and identified the drugs causing allergic symptoms (e.g., Cefuroxime, Spironolactone, Tioconazole). Our results agreed with allergenicity of these drugs reported in literature.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To aid the research community, we developed a smart-device compatible web server ChAlPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/chalpred/) that allows to predict and design the chemicals with allergenic properties.",True,False,5.0,,chalpred,,18.9975684,ok,,,iedb,v2,0.9975684,ChAlPred,True,True,True,,https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/chalpred/,https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/chalpred/,True,...ed a smart-device compatible web server ChAlPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/chalpred/) that allows to predict and design the chemicals...,1

While MEDLINE contains many biomedical articles including those on traditional medicine, it does not categorize those articles by specific research area. The aim of this study was to provide a method that searches for articles only on traditional medicine in Northeast Asia, including traditional Chinese medicine, from among the articles in MEDLINE.<h4>Results</h4>This research established an SVM-based classifier model to identify articles on traditional medicine. The TAK + HM classifier, trained with the features of title, abstract, keywords, herbal data, and MeSH, has a precision of 0.954 and a recall of 0.902. In particular, the feature of herbal data significantly increased the performance of the classifier.

Researchers have studied the regulation of the cell cycle in several organisms, employing a wide range of high-throughput technologies, such as microarray-based mRNA expression profiling and quantitative proteomics. Due to its complexity, the cell cycle can also fail or otherwise change in many different ways if important genes are knocked out, which has been studied in several microscopy-based knockdown screens. The data from these many large-scale efforts are not easily accessed, analyzed and combined due to their inherent heterogeneity.

34009308,DeepChargePredictor: a web server for predicting QM-based atomic charges via state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms.,"<h4>Summary</h4>High-level quantum mechanics (QM) methods are no doubt the most reliable approaches for the prediction of atomic charges, but it usually needs very large computational resources, which apparently hinders the use of high-quality atomic charges in large-scale molecular modeling, such as high-throughput virtual screening. To solve this problem, several algorithms based on machine-learning (ML) have been developed to fit high-level QM atomic charges. Here, we proposed DeepChargePredictor, a web server that is able to generate the high-level QM atomic charges for small molecules based on two state-of-the-art ML algorithms developed in our group, namely AtomPathDescriptor and DeepAtomicCharge. These two algorithms were seamlessly integrated into the platform with the capability to predict three kinds of charges (i.e. RESP, AM1-BCC and DDEC) widely used in structure-based drug design. Moreover, we have comprehensively evaluated the performance of these charges generated by DeepChargePredictor for large-scale drug design applications, such as end-point binding free energy calculations and virtual screening, which all show reliable or even better performance compared with the baseline methods.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The data in the article can be obtained on the web page http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/deepchargepredictor/publication.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,7.0,,deepchargepredictor,,18.99669117,ok,,,,v2,0.99669117,DeepChargePredictor,True,True,True,,http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/deepchargepredictor/publication,http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/deepchargepredictor/publication,True,...ta in the article can be obtained on the web page http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/deepchargepredictor/publication.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1

33097024,LUMINOUS database: lumbar multifidus muscle segmentation from ultrasound images.,"<h4>Background</h4>Among the paraspinal muscles, the structure and function of the lumbar multifidus (LM) has become of great interest to researchers and clinicians involved in lower back pain and muscle rehabilitation. Ultrasound (US) imaging of the LM muscle is a useful clinical tool which can be used in the assessment of muscle morphology and function. US is widely used due to its portability, cost-effectiveness, and ease-of-use. In order to assess muscle function, quantitative information of the LM must be extracted from the US image by means of manual segmentation. However, manual segmentation requires a higher level of training and experience and is characterized by a level of difficulty and subjectivity associated with image interpretation. Thus, the development of automated segmentation methods is warranted and would strongly benefit clinicians and researchers. The aim of this study is to provide a database which will contribute to the development of automated segmentation algorithms of the LM.<h4>Construction and content</h4>This database provides the US ground truth of the left and right LM muscles at the L5 level (in prone and standing positions) of 109 young athletic adults involved in Concordia University's varsity teams.

23667459,The PARIGA server for real time filtering and analysis of reciprocal BLAST results.,"BLAST-based similarity searches are commonly used in several applications involving both nucleotide and protein sequences. These applications span from simple tasks such as mapping sequences over a database to more complex procedures as clustering or annotation processes. When the amount of analysed data increases, manual inspection of BLAST results become a tedious procedure. Tools for parsing or filtering BLAST results for different purposes are then required. We describe here PARIGA (http://resources.bioinformatica.crs4.it/pariga/), a server that enables users to perform all-against-all BLAST searches on two sets of sequences selected by the user. Moreover, since it stores the two BLAST output in a python-serialized-objects database, results can be filtered according to several parameters in real-time fashion, without re-running the process and avoiding additional programming efforts. Results can be interrogated by the user using logical operations, for example to retrieve cases where two queries match same targets, or when sequences from the two datasets are reciprocal best hits, or when a query matches a target in multiple regions. The Pariga web server is designed to be a helpful tool for managing the results of sequence similarity searches. The design and implementation of the server renders all operations very fast and easy to use.",True,False,5.0,,,pariga,18.9949353,ok,,,,v2,0.9949353,,True,False,False,,http://resources.bioinformatica.crs4.it/pariga/,http://resources.bioinformatica.crs4.it/pariga/,True,"...poses are then required.

28535296,MetaSRA: normalized human sample-specific metadata for the Sequence Read Archive.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) promises great biological insight if one could analyze the data in the aggregate; however, the data remain largely underutilized, in part, due to the poor structure of the metadata associated with each sample. The rules governing submissions to the SRA do not dictate a standardized set of terms that should be used to describe the biological samples from which the sequencing data are derived. As a result, the metadata include many synonyms, spelling variants and references to outside sources of information. Furthermore, manual annotation of the data remains intractable due to the large number of samples in the archive. For these reasons, it has been difficult to perform large-scale analyses that study the relationships between biomolecular processes and phenotype across diverse diseases, tissues and cell types present in the SRA.<h4>Results</h4>We present MetaSRA, a database of normalized SRA human sample-specific metadata following a schema inspired by the metadata organization of the ENCODE project. This schema involves mapping samples to terms in biomedical ontologies, labeling each sample with a sample-type category, and extracting real-valued properties. We automated these tasks via a novel computational pipeline.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The MetaSRA is available at metasra.biostat.wisc.edu via both a searchable web interface and bulk downloads.

The metalloenzymes mediating this metabolism, hydrogenases, are encoded by over 60 microbial phyla and are present in all major ecosystems. We developed a classification system and web tool, HydDB, for the structural and functional analysis of these enzymes. We show that hydrogenase function can be predicted by primary sequence alone using an expanded classification scheme (comprising 29 [NiFe], 8 [FeFe], and 1 [Fe] hydrogenase classes) that defines 11 new classes with distinct biological functions. Using this scheme, we built a web tool that rapidly and reliably classifies hydrogenase primary sequences using a combination of k-nearest neighbors' algorithms and CDD referencing. Demonstrating its capacity, the tool reliably predicted hydrogenase content and function in 12 newly-sequenced bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. HydDB provides the capacity to browse the amino acid sequences of 3248 annotated hydrogenase catalytic subunits and also contains a detailed repository of physiological, biochemical, and structural information about the 38 hydrogenase classes defined here.

30816123,ImmtorLig_DB: repertoire of virtually screened small molecules against immune receptors to bolster host immunity.,"Host directed therapies to boost immunity against infection are gaining considerable impetus following the observation that use of antibiotics has become a continuous source for the emergence of drug resistant strains of pathogens. Receptors expressed by the cells of immune system play a cardinal role in initiating sequence of events necessary to ameliorate many morbid conditions. Although, ligands for the immune receptors are available; but their use is limited due to complex structure, synthesis and cost-effectiveness. Virtual screening (VS) is an integral part of chemoinformatics and computer-aided drug design (CADD) and aims to streamline the process of drug discovery. ImmtorLig_DB is a repertoire of 5000 novel small molecules, screened from ZINC database and ranked using structure based virtual screening (SBVS) against 25 immune receptors which play a pivotal role in defending and initiating the activation of immune system. Consequently, in the current study, small molecules were screened by docking on the essential domains present on the receptors expressed by cells of immune system. The screened molecules exhibited efficacious binding to immune receptors, and indicated a possibility of discovering novel small molecules. Other features of ImmtorLig_DB include information about availability, clustering analysis, and estimation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of the screened small molecules. Structural comparisons indicate that predicted small molecules may be considered novel.

29616063,MorphDB: Prioritizing Genes for Specialized Metabolism Pathways and Gene Ontology Categories in Plants.,"Recent times have seen an enormous growth of ""omics"" data, of which high-throughput gene expression data are arguably the most important from a functional perspective. Despite huge improvements in computational techniques for the functional classification of gene sequences, common similarity-based methods often fall short of providing full and reliable functional information. Recently, the combination of comparative genomics with approaches in functional genomics has received considerable interest for gene function analysis, leveraging both gene expression based guilt-by-association methods and annotation efforts in closely related model organisms. Besides the identification of missing genes in pathways, these methods also typically enable the discovery of biological regulators (i.e., transcription factors or signaling genes). A previously built guilt-by-association method is MORPH, which was proven to be an efficient algorithm that performs particularly well in identifying and prioritizing missing genes in plant metabolic pathways. Here, we present MorphDB, a resource where MORPH-based candidate genes for large-scale functional annotations (Gene Ontology, MapMan bins) are integrated across multiple plant species. Besides a gene centric query utility, we present a comparative network approach that enables researchers to efficiently browse MORPH predictions across functional gene sets and species, facilitating efficient gene discovery and candidate gene prioritization.

The accuracy and precision of the coordinates in these macromolecular NMR ensembles can be improved by recalculation using the available experimental data and present-day software. Such efforts, however, generally fail on half of all NMR ensembles due to the syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of the underlying data and the wide variety of formats used for their deposition.

31106379,Drug ReposER: a web server for predicting similar amino acid arrangements to known drug binding interfaces for potential drug repositioning.,"A common drug repositioning strategy is the re-application of an existing drug to address alternative targets. A crucial aspect to enable such repurposing is that the drug's binding site on the original target is similar to that on the alternative target. Based on the assumption that proteins with similar binding sites may bind to similar drugs, the 3D substructure similarity data can be used to identify similar sites in other proteins that are not known targets. The Drug ReposER (DRug REPOSitioning Exploration Resource) web server is designed to identify potential targets for drug repurposing based on sub-structural similarity to the binding interfaces of known drug binding sites. The application has pre-computed amino acid arrangements from protein structures in the Protein Data Bank that are similar to the 3D arrangements of known drug binding sites thus allowing users to explore them as alternative targets. Users can annotate new structures for sites that are similarly arranged to the residues found in known drug binding interfaces.

21791039,"Comparative high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and development of SiESTa, the Silene EST annotation database.","<h4>Background</h4>The genus Silene is widely used as a model system for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions in plants, but advances in using the genus as a model system are impeded by the lack of available resources for studying its genome. Massively parallel sequencing cDNA has recently developed into an efficient method for characterizing the transcriptomes of non-model organisms, generating massive amounts of data that enable the study of multiple species in a comparative framework. The sequences generated provide an excellent resource for identifying expressed genes, characterizing functional variation and developing molecular markers, thereby laying the foundations for future studies on gene sequence and gene expression divergence. Here, we report the results of a comparative transcriptome sequencing study of eight individuals representing four Silene and one Dianthus species as outgroup. All sequences and annotations have been deposited in a newly developed and publicly available database called SiESTa, the Silene EST annotation database.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1,041,122 EST reads were generated in two runs on a Roche GS-FLX 454 pyrosequencing platform. EST reads were analyzed separately for all eight individuals sequenced and were assembled into contigs using TGICL. These were annotated with results from BLASTX searches and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were characterized. Unassembled reads were kept as singletons and together with the contigs contributed to the unigenes characterized in each individual. The high quality of unigenes is evidenced by the proportion (49%) that have significant hits in similarity searches with the A. thaliana proteome. The SiESTa database is accessible at http://www.siesta.ethz.ch.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The sequence collections established in the present study provide an important genomic resource for four Silene and one Dianthus species and will help to further develop Silene as a plant model system. The genes characterized will be useful for future research not only in the species included in the present study, but also in related species for which no genomic resources are yet available.

A large number (>1500) of unique BRCA1 variants have been identified in the population and can be classified as pathogenic, non-pathogenic or as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Many VUS are rare missense variants leading to single amino acid changes. Their impact on protein function cannot be directly inferred from sequence information, precluding assessment of their pathogenicity. Thus, functional assays are critical to assess the impact of these VUS on protein activity. BRCA1 is a multifunctional protein and different assays have been used to assess the impact of variants on different biochemical activities and biological processes.<h4>Methods and results</h4>To facilitate VUS analysis, we have developed a visualisation resource that compiles and displays functional data on all documented BRCA1 missense variants. BRCA1 Circos is a web-based visualisation tool based on the freely available Circos software package. The BRCA1 Circos web tool (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/circos/) aggregates data from all published BRCA1 missense variants for functional studies, harmonises their results and presents various functionalities to search and interpret individual-level functional information for each BRCA1 missense variant.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This research visualisation tool will serve as a quick one-stop publically available reference for all the BRCA1 missense variants that have been functionally assessed. It will facilitate meta-analysis of functional data and improve assessment of pathogenicity of VUS.",True,False,3.0,,,brca1,18.98826706,ok,,publically available,circos,v2,0.98826706,BRCA1 Circos,True,False,False,,http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/circos/,http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/circos/,True,...rcos software package.

24957597,PubServer: literature searches by homology.,"PubServer, available at http://pubserver.burnham.org/, is a tool to automatically collect, filter and analyze publications associated with groups of homologous proteins. Protein entries in databases such as Entrez Protein database at NCBI contain information about publications associated with a given protein. The scope of these publications varies a lot: they include studies focused on biochemical functions of individual proteins, but also reports from genome sequencing projects that introduce tens of thousands of proteins. Collecting and analyzing publications related to sets of homologous proteins help in functional annotation of novel protein families and in improving annotations of well-studied protein families or individual genes. However, performing such collection and analysis manually is a tedious and time-consuming process. PubServer automatically collects identifiers of homologous proteins using PSI-Blast, retrieves literature references from corresponding database entries and filters out publications unlikely to contain useful information about individual proteins. It also prepares simple vocabulary statistics from titles, abstracts and MeSH terms to identify the most frequently occurring keywords, which may help to quickly identify common themes in these publications. The filtering criteria applied to collected publications are user-adjustable.

23819482,WS-SNPs&GO: a web server for predicting the deleterious effect of human protein variants using functional annotation.,"<h4>Background</h4>SNPs&GO is a method for the prediction of deleterious Single Amino acid Polymorphisms (SAPs) using protein functional annotation. In this work, we present the web server implementation of SNPs&GO (WS-SNPs&GO). The server is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and for a given protein, its input comprises: the sequence and/or its three-dimensional structure (when available), a set of target variations and its functional Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The output of the server provides, for each protein variation, the probabilities to be associated to human diseases.<h4>Results</h4>The server consists of two main components, including updated versions of the sequence-based SNPs&GO (recently scored as one of the best algorithms for predicting deleterious SAPs) and of the structure-based SNPs&GO(3d) programs. Sequence and structure based algorithms are extensively tested on a large set of annotated variations extracted from the SwissVar database. Selecting a balanced dataset with more than 38,000 SAPs, the sequence-based approach achieves 81% overall accuracy, 0.61 correlation coefficient and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.88. For the subset of ~6,600 variations mapped on protein structures available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the structure-based method scores with 84% overall accuracy, 0.68 correlation coefficient, and 0.91 AUC. When tested on a new blind set of variations, the results of the server are 79% and 83% overall accuracy for the sequence-based and structure-based inputs, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>WS-SNPs&GO is a valuable tool that includes in a unique framework information derived from protein sequence, structure, evolutionary profile, and protein function.

23793516,"MuPIT interactive: webserver for mapping variant positions to annotated, interactive 3D structures.","Mutation position imaging toolbox (MuPIT) interactive is a browser-based application for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), which automatically maps the genomic coordinates of SNVs onto the coordinates of available three-dimensional (3D) protein structures. The application is designed for interactive browser-based visualization of the putative functional relevance of SNVs by biologists who are not necessarily experts either in bioinformatics or protein structure. Users may submit batches of several thousand SNVs and review all protein structures that cover the SNVs, including available functional annotations such as binding sites, mutagenesis experiments, and common polymorphisms. Multiple SNVs may be mapped onto each structure, enabling 3D visualization of SNV clusters and their relationship to functionally annotated positions. We illustrate the utility of MuPIT interactive in rationalizing the impact of selected polymorphisms in the PharmGKB database, somatic mutations identified in the Cancer Genome Atlas study of invasive breast carcinomas, and rare variants identified in the exome sequencing project.

28011781,cBinderDB: a covalent binding agent database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Small molecule drug candidates with attractive toxicity profiles that modulate target proteins through non-covalent interactions are usually favored by scientists and pharmaceutical industry. In the past decades, many non-covalent binding agents have been developed for different diseases. However, an increasing attention has been paid to covalent binding agents in pharmaceutical fields during recent years. Many covalent binding agents entered clinical trials and exerted significant advantages for diseases such as infection, cancers, gastrointestinal disorders, central nervous system or cardiovascular diseases. It has been recognized that covalent binding ligands can be attractive drug candidates. But, there is lack of resource to support covalent ligand discovery.<h4>Results</h4>Hence, we initiated a covalent binder database (cBinderDB). To our best knowledge, it is the first online database that provides information on covalent binding compound structures, chemotypes, targets, covalent binding types and other biological properties. The covalent binding targets are annotated with biological functions, protein family and domains, gene information, modulators and receptor-ligand complex structure. The data in the database were collected from scientific publications by combining a text mining method and manual inspection processes. cBinderDB covers covalent binder's data up to September 2016.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>cBinderDB is freely available at www.rcdd.org.cn/cbinderdb/.<h4>Contact</h4>guqiong@mail.sysu.edu.cn or junxu@biochemomes.com .<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,3.0,,cbinderdb,,18.9875614,ok,,binderdb,h,v2,0.9875614,cBinderDB,True,True,True,,http://www.rcdd.org.cn/cbinderdb/,http://www.rcdd.org.cn/cbinderdb/,True,,1

23985157,MONA - Interactive manipulation of molecule collections.,": Working with small-molecule datasets is a routine task for cheminformaticians and chemists. The analysis and comparison of vendor catalogues and the compilation of promising candidates as starting points for screening campaigns are but a few very common applications. The workflows applied for this purpose usually consist of multiple basic cheminformatics tasks such as checking for duplicates or filtering by physico-chemical properties. Pipelining tools allow to create and change such workflows without much effort, but usually do not support interventions once the pipeline has been started. In many contexts, however, the best suited workflow is not known in advance, thus making it necessary to take the results of the previous steps into consideration before proceeding.To support intuition-driven processing of compound collections, we developed MONA, an interactive tool that has been designed to prepare and visualize large small-molecule datasets. Using an SQL database common cheminformatics tasks such as analysis and filtering can be performed interactively with various methods for visual support. Great care was taken in creating a simple, intuitive user interface which can be instantly used without any setup steps. MONA combines the interactivity of molecule database systems with the simplicity of pipelining tools, thus enabling the case-to-case application of chemistry expert knowledge.

Despite the growing number of online servers and databases devoted to prediction/classification of allosteric sites and their characteristics, there is a lack of resources for an efficient and quick estimation of the causality and energetics of allosteric communication.<h4>Results</h4>The AlloSigMA server implements a unique approach on the basis of the recently introduced structure-based statistical mechanical models of allosteric signaling. It provides an interactive framework for estimating the allosteric free energy as a result of the ligand(s) binding, mutation(s) and their combinations.

The transcriptome is ""dynamic"" and tissue-specific, but typically the probed tissues to analyze (TA) are different from the tissue of interest (TI) based on pathophysiology.<h4>Results</h4>We developed Phenotype-Tissue Expression and Exploration (PTEE), a tool to facilitate the decision about the most suitable TA for RNA-seq. We integrated phenotype-annotated genes, used 54 tissues from GTEx to perform correlation analyses and identify expressed genes and transcripts between TAs and TIs. We identified skeletal muscle as the most appropriate TA to inquire for cardiac arrhythmia genes and skin as a good proxy to study neurodevelopmental disorders. We also explored RNA-seq limitations and show that on-off switching of gene expression during ontogenesis or circadian rhythm can cause blind spots for RNA-seq-based analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PTEE aids the identification of tissues suitable for RNA-seq for a given pathology to increase the success rate of diagnosis and gene discovery.

28453561,A WebGIS platform for the monitoring of Farm Animal Genetic Resources (GENMON).,"<h4>Background</h4>In 2007, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated the Global plan of action for Farm Animal Genetic Resources (FAnGR). The main goal of this plan is to reduce further loss of genetic diversity in farm animals, so as to protect and promote the diversity of farm animal resources. An important step to reach this goal is to monitor and prioritize endangered breeds in the context of conservation programs.<h4>Methodology/web portal implementation</h4>The GENMON WebGIS platform is able to monitor FAnGR and to evaluate the degree of endangerment of livestock breeds. The system takes into account pedigree and introgression information, the geographical concentration of animals, the cryo-conservation plan and the sustainability of breeding activities based on socio-economic data as well as present and future land use conditions. A multi-criteria decision tool supports the aggregation of the multi-thematic indices mentioned above using the MACBETH method, which is based on a weighted average using satisfaction thresholds. GENMON is a monitoring tool to reach subjective decisions made by a government agency. It relies on open source software and is available at http://lasigsrv2.epfl.ch/genmon-ch.<h4>Results/significance</h4>GENMON allows users to upload pedigree-information (animal ID, parents, birthdate, sex, location and introgression) from a specific livestock breed and to define species and/or region-specific weighting parameters and thresholds. The program then completes a pedigree analysis and derives several indices that are used to calculate an integrated score of conservation prioritization for the breeds under investigation. The score can be visualized on a geographic map and allows a fast, intuitive and regional identification of breeds in danger. Appropriate conservation actions and breeding programs can thus be undertaken in order to promote the recovery of the genetic diversity in livestock breeds in need.

27336171,QuIN: A Web Server for Querying and Visualizing Chromatin Interaction Networks.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Recent studies of the human genome have indicated that regulatory elements (e.g. promoters and enhancers) at distal genomic locations can interact with each other via chromatin folding and affect gene expression levels. Genomic technologies for mapping interactions between DNA regions, e.g., ChIA-PET and HiC, can generate genome-wide maps of interactions between regulatory elements. These interaction datasets are important resources to infer distal gene targets of non-coding regulatory elements and to facilitate prioritization of critical loci for important cellular functions. With the increasing diversity and complexity of genomic information and public ontologies, making sense of these datasets demands integrative and easy-to-use software tools. Moreover, network representation of chromatin interaction maps enables effective data visualization, integration, and mining. Currently, there is no software that can take full advantage of network theory approaches for the analysis of chromatin interaction datasets. To fill this gap, we developed a web-based application, QuIN, which enables: 1) building and visualizing chromatin interaction networks, 2) annotating networks with user-provided private and publicly available functional genomics and interaction datasets, 3) querying network components based on gene name or chromosome location, and 4) utilizing network based measures to identify and prioritize critical regulatory targets and their direct and indirect interactions.<h4>Availability</h4>QuIN's web server is available at http://quin.jax.org QuIN is developed in Java and JavaScript, utilizing an Apache Tomcat web server and MySQL database and the source code is available under the GPLV3 license available on GitHub: https://github.com/UcarLab/QuIN/.",True,False,5.0,,,quin,18.97764075,ok,,,,v2,0.97764075,QuIN,True,True,True,,http://quin.jax.org,http://quin.jax.org,True,"...vailability</h4>QuIN's web server is available at http://quin.jax.org QuIN is developed in Java and JavaScript, utilizi...",1
27663502,LD Hub: a centralized database and web interface to perform LD score regression that maximizes the potential of summary level GWAS data for SNP heritability and genetic correlation analysis.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>LD score regression is a reliable and efficient method of using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level results data to estimate the SNP heritability of complex traits and diseases, partition this heritability into functional categories, and estimate the genetic correlation between different phenotypes. Because the method relies on summary level results data, LD score regression is computationally tractable even for very large sample sizes. However, publicly available GWAS summary-level data are typically stored in different databases and have different formats, making it difficult to apply LD score regression to estimate genetic correlations across many different traits simultaneously.<h4>Results</h4>In this manuscript, we describe LD Hub - a centralized database of summary-level GWAS results for 173 diseases/traits from different publicly available resources/consortia and a web interface that automates the LD score regression analysis pipeline. To demonstrate functionality and validate our software, we replicated previously reported LD score regression analyses of 49 traits/diseases using LD Hub; and estimated SNP heritability and the genetic correlation across the different phenotypes. We also present new results obtained by uploading a recent atopic dermatitis GWAS meta-analysis to examine the genetic correlation between the condition and other potentially related traits. In response to the growing availability of publicly accessible GWAS summary-level results data, our database and the accompanying web interface will ensure maximal uptake of the LD score regression methodology, provide a useful database for the public dissemination of GWAS results, and provide a method for easily screening hundreds of traits for overlapping genetic aetiologies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The web interface and instructions for using LD Hub are available at http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/ CONTACT: jie.zheng@bristol.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,6.0,,,ld hub,18.9759504,ok,,,hub,v2,0.9759504,LD Hub,True,True,True,,http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/,http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/,True,...nd instructions for using LD Hub are available at http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/ CONTACT: jie.zheng@bristol.ac.ukSupplementary inf...,1
33907838,Demetra Application: An integrated genotype analysis web server for clinical genomics in endometriosis.,"Demetra Application is a holistic integrated and scalable bioinformatics web‑based tool designed to assist medical experts and researchers in the process of diagnosing endometriosis. The application identifies the most prominent gene variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing endometriosis using the genomic data provided for the patient by a medical expert. The present study analyzed >28.000 endometriosis‑related publications using data mining and semantic techniques aimed towards extracting the endometriosis‑related genes and SNPs. The extracted knowledge was filtered, evaluated, annotated, classified, and stored in the Demetra Application Database (DAD). Moreover, an updated gene regulatory network with the genes implements in endometriosis was established. This was followed by the design and development of the Demetra Application, in which the generated datasets and results were included. The application was tested and presented herein with whole‑exome sequencing data from seven related patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis‑related SNPs and variants identified in genome‑wide association studies (GWAS), whole‑genome (WGS), whole‑exome (WES), or targeted sequencing information were classified, annotated and analyzed in a consolidated patient profile with clinical significance information. Probable genes associated with the patient's genomic profile were visualized using several graphs, including chromosome ideograms, statistic bars and regulatory networks through data mining studies with relative publications, in an effort to obtain a representative number of the most credible candidate genes and biological pathways associated with endometriosis. An evaluation analysis was performed on seven patients from a three‑generation family with endometriosis. All the recognized gene variants that were previously considered to be associated with endometriosis were properly identified in the output profile per patient, and by comparing the results, novel findings emerged.

29659718,A sequence family database built on ECOD structural domains.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The ECOD database classifies protein domains based on their evolutionary relationships, considering both remote and close homology. The family group in ECOD provides classification of domains that are closely related to each other based on sequence similarity. Due to different perspectives on domain definition, direct application of existing sequence domain databases, such as Pfam, to ECOD struggles with several shortcomings.<h4>Results</h4>We created multiple sequence alignments and profiles from ECOD domains with the help of structural information in alignment building and boundary delineation. We validated the alignment quality by scoring structure superposition to demonstrate that they are comparable to curated seed alignments in Pfam. Comparison to Pfam and CDD reveals that 27 and 16% of ECOD families are new, but they are also dominated by small families, likely because of the sampling bias from the PDB database. There are 35 and 48% of families whose boundaries are modified comparing to counterparts in Pfam and CDD, respectively.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The new families are now integrated in the ECOD website.

21519818,PRICE (PRotein Interface Conservation and Energetics): a server for the analysis of protein-protein interfaces.,"Residues in a protein-protein interface that are important for forming and stabilizing the interaction can usually be identified by looking at patterns of evolutionary conservation in groups of homologous proteins and also by the computational identification of binding hotspots. The PRICE (PRotein Interface Conservation and Energetics) server takes the coordinates of a protein-protein complex, dissects the interface into core and rim regions, and calculates (1) the degree of conservation (measured as the sequence entropy), as well as (2) the change in free energy of binding (∆∆G, due to alanine scanning mutagenesis) of interface residues. Results are displayed as color-coded plots and also made available for download. This enables the computational identification of binding hot spots, based on which further experiments can be designed. The method will aid in protein functional prediction by correct assignment of hot regions involved in binding. Consideration of sequence entropies for residues with large ∆∆G values may provide an indication of the biological relevance of the interface.

28921375,Convex-PL: a novel knowledge-based potential for protein-ligand interactions deduced from structural databases using convex optimization.,"We present a novel optimization approach to train a free-shape distance-dependent protein-ligand scoring function called Convex-PL. We do not impose any functional form of the scoring function. Instead, we decompose it into a polynomial basis and deduce the expansion coefficients from the structural knowledge base using a convex formulation of the optimization problem. Also, for the training set we do not generate false poses with molecular docking packages, but use constant RMSD rigid-body deformations of the ligands inside the binding pockets. This allows the obtained scoring function to be generally applicable to scoring of structural ensembles generated with different docking methods.

25313160,Open TG-GATEs: a large-scale toxicogenomics database.,"Toxicogenomics focuses on assessing the safety of compounds using gene expression profiles. Gene expression signatures from large toxicogenomics databases are expected to perform better than small databases in identifying biomarkers for the prediction and evaluation of drug safety based on a compound's toxicological mechanisms in animal target organs. Over the past 10 years, the Japanese Toxicogenomics Project consortium (TGP) has been developing a large-scale toxicogenomics database consisting of data from 170 compounds (mostly drugs) with the aim of improving and enhancing drug safety assessment. Most of the data generated by the project (e.g. gene expression, pathology, lot number) are freely available to the public via Open TG-GATEs (Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System).

24974201,The Amordad database engine for metagenomics.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Several technical challenges in metagenomic data analysis, including assembling metagenomic sequence data or identifying operational taxonomic units, are both significant and well known. These forms of analysis are increasingly cited as conceptually flawed, given the extreme variation within traditionally defined species and rampant horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, computational requirements of such analysis have hindered content-based organization of metagenomic data at large scale.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we introduce the Amordad database engine for alignment-free, content-based indexing of metagenomic datasets. Amordad places the metagenome comparison problem in a geometric context, and uses an indexing strategy that combines random hashing with a regular nearest neighbor graph. This framework allows refinement of the database over time by continual application of random hash functions, with the effect of each hash function encoded in the nearest neighbor graph. This eliminates the need to explicitly maintain the hash functions in order for query efficiency to benefit from the accumulated randomness. Results on real and simulated data show that Amordad can support logarithmic query time for identifying similar metagenomes even as the database size reaches into the millions.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code, licensed under the GNU general public license (version 3) is freely available for download from http://smithlabresearch.org/amordad<h4>Contact</h4>andrewds@usc.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,7.0,,amordad,,18.9661537,ok,,,,v2,0.9661537,,True,False,False,,http://smithlabresearch.org/amordad,http://smithlabresearch.org/amordad,True,...(version 3) is freely available for download from http://smithlabresearch.org/amordad<h4>Contact</h4>andrewds@usc.edu<h4>Supplementary...,1
32883210,"""METAGENOTE: a simplified web platform for metadata annotation of genomic samples and streamlined submission to NCBI's sequence read archive"".","<h4>Background</h4>The improvements in genomics methods coupled with readily accessible high-throughput sequencing have contributed to our understanding of microbial species, metagenomes, infectious diseases and more. To maximize the impact of these genomics studies, it is important that data from biological samples will become publicly available with standardized metadata. The availability of data at public archives provides the hope that greater insights could be obtained through integration with multi-omics data, reproducibility of published studies, or meta-analyses of large diverse datasets. These datasets should include a description of the host, organism, environmental source of the specimen, spatial-temporal information and other relevant metadata, but unfortunately these attributes are often missing and when present, they show inconsistencies in the use of metadata standards and ontologies.<h4>Results</h4>METAGENOTE ( https://metagenote.niaid.nih.gov ) is a web portal that greatly facilitates the annotation of samples from genomic studies and streamlines the submission process of sequencing files and metadata to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (Leinonen R, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 39:D19-21, 2011) for public access. This platform offers a wide selection of packages for different types of biological and experimental studies with a special emphasis on the standardization of metadata reporting. These packages follow the guidelines from the MIxS standards developed by the Genomics Standard Consortium (GSC) and adopted by the three partners of the International Nucleotides Sequencing Database Collaboration (INSDC) (Cochrane G, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 44:D48-50, 2016) - National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). METAGENOTE then compiles, validates and manages the submission through an easy-to-use web interface minimizing submission errors and eliminating the need for submitting sequencing files via a separate file transfer mechanism.<h4>Conclusions</h4>METAGENOTE is a public resource that focuses on simplifying the annotation and submission process of data with its corresponding metadata. Users of METAGENOTE will benefit from the easy to use annotation interface but most importantly will be encouraged to publish metadata following standards and ontologies that make the public data available for reuse.",True,False,3.0,,,etagenote,18.95394105,ok,sra | sequence read archive,sequence read archive | dna data bank of japan | international nucleotides sequencing database,sra | insdc | ddbj | metagenote,v2,0.95394105,"""METAGENOTE",True,False,False,,https://metagenote.niaid.nih.gov,https://metagenote.niaid.nih.gov,True,...dards and ontologies.<h4>Results</h4>METAGENOTE ( https://metagenote.niaid.nih.gov ) is a web portal that greatly facilitates the an...,1

At present, there are more than 2,000 unique HTLV-1 isolate sequences published. A central database to aggregate sequence information from a range of epidemiological aspects including HTLV-1 infections, pathogenesis, origins, and evolutionary dynamics would be useful to scientists and physicians worldwide. Described here, we have developed a database that collects and annotates sequence data and can be accessed through a user-friendly search interface. The HTLV-1 Molecular Epidemiology Database website is available at http://htlv1db.bahia.fiocruz.br/.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>All data was obtained from publications available at GenBank or through contact with the authors. The database was developed using Apache Webserver 2.1.6 and SGBD MySQL. The webpage interfaces were developed in HTML and sever-side scripting written in PHP. The HTLV-1 Molecular Epidemiology Database is hosted on the Gonçalo Moniz/FIOCRUZ Research Center server. There are currently 2,457 registered sequences with 2,024 (82.37%) of those sequences representing unique isolates. Of these sequences, 803 (39.67%) contain information about clinical status (TSP/HAM, 17.19%; ATL, 7.41%; asymptomatic, 12.89%; other diseases, 2.17%; and no information, 60.32%). Further, 7.26% of sequences contain information on patient gender while 5.23% of sequences provide the age of the patient.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>The HTLV-1 Molecular Epidemiology Database retrieves and stores annotated HTLV-1 proviral sequences from clinical, epidemiological, and geographical studies.

28025346,The importance of digitized biocollections as a source of trait data and a new VertNet resource.,"For vast areas of the globe and large parts of the tree of life, data needed to inform trait diversity is incomplete. Such trait data, when fully assembled, however, form the link between the evolutionary history of organisms, their assembly into communities, and the nature and functioning of ecosystems. Recent efforts to close data gaps have focused on collating trait-by-species databases, which only provide species-level, aggregated value ranges for traits of interest and often lack the direct observations on which those ranges are based. Perhaps under-appreciated is that digitized biocollection records collectively contain a vast trove of trait data measured directly from individuals, but this content remains hidden and highly heterogeneous, impeding discoverability and use. We developed and deployed a suite of openly accessible software tools in order to collate a full set of trait descriptions and extract two key traits, body length and mass, from >18 million specimen records in VertNet, a global biodiversity data publisher and aggregator. We tested success rate of these tools against hand-checked validation data sets and characterized quality and quantity. A post-processing toolkit was developed to standardize and harmonize data sets, and to integrate this improved content into VertNet for broadest reuse. The result of this work was to add more than 1.5 million harmonized measurements on vertebrate body mass and length directly to specimen records. Rates of false positives and negatives for extracted data were extremely low. We also created new tools for filtering, querying, and assembling this research-ready vertebrate trait content for view and download. Our work has yielded a novel database and platform for harmonized trait content that will grow as tools introduced here become part of publication workflows. We close by noting how this effort extends to new communities already developing similar digitized content.Database URL: http://portal.vertnet.org/search?advanced=1.",True,False,5.0,,vertnet,,18.94184303,ok,,,,v2,0.94184303,,True,False,False,,http://portal.vertnet.org/search?advanced=1,http://portal.vertnet.org/search?advanced=1,True,...eveloping similar digitized content.Database URL: http://portal.vertnet.org/search?advanced=1.,1
31106356,Yosshi: a web-server for disulfide engineering by bioinformatic analysis of diverse protein families.,"Disulfide bonds play a significant role in protein stability, function or regulation but are poorly conserved among evolutionarily related proteins. The Yosshi can help to understand the role of S-S bonds by comparing sequences and structures of homologs with diverse properties and different disulfide connectivity patterns within a common structural fold of a superfamily, and assist to select the most promising hot-spots to improve stability of proteins/enzymes or modulate their functions by introducing naturally occurring crosslinks. The bioinformatic analysis is supported by the integrated Mustguseal web-server to construct large structure-guided sequence alignments of functionally diverse protein families that can include thousands of proteins based on all available information in public databases. The Yosshi+Mustguseal is a new integrated web-tool for a systematic homology-driven analysis and engineering of S-S bonds that facilitates a broader interpretation of disulfides not just as a factor of structural stability, but rather as a mechanism to implement functional diversity within a superfamily. The results can be downloaded as a content-rich PyMol session file or further studied online using the HTML5-based interactive analysis tools.

28178937,SPANG: a SPARQL client supporting generation and reuse of queries for distributed RDF databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Toward improved interoperability of distributed biological databases, an increasing number of datasets have been published in the standardized Resource Description Framework (RDF). Although the powerful SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) provides a basis for exploiting RDF databases, writing SPARQL code is burdensome for users including bioinformaticians. Thus, an easy-to-use interface is necessary.<h4>Results</h4>We developed SPANG, a SPARQL client that has unique features for querying RDF datasets. SPANG dynamically generates typical SPARQL queries according to specified arguments. It can also call SPARQL template libraries constructed in a local system or published on the Web. Further, it enables combinatorial execution of multiple queries, each with a distinct target database. These features facilitate easy and effective access to RDF datasets and integrative analysis of distributed data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SPANG helps users to exploit RDF datasets by generation and reuse of SPARQL queries through a simple interface.

Although, pharmaceutical research has brought up remedial drugs and numerous candidates in various phases of clinical trials, off-target effects and unwanted physiological actions are a constant source of concern and contra indicatory in case of diabetic patients. Here we present a phytoremedial database, Phyto Diab Care, broadly applicable to any known anti-diabetic medicinal plant and phytochemicals sourced from them. Utilization of the traditional medicine knowledge for combating diabetes without creating unwanted physiological actions is our major emphasis. Data collected from peer-reviewed publications and phytochemicals were added to the customizable database by means of an extended relational design. The strength of this resource is in providing rapid retrieval of data from large volumes of text at a high degree of accuracy. Enhanced web interface allows multi-criteria based information filtering. Furthermore, the availability of 2D and 3D structures from molecular docking studies with any efficacy on the insulin signaling pathway makes the resource searchable and comparable in an intuitive manner.

27760124,"rasbhari: Optimizing Spaced Seeds for Database Searching, Read Mapping and Alignment-Free Sequence Comparison.","Many algorithms for sequence analysis rely on word matching or word statistics. Often, these approaches can be improved if binary patterns representing match and don't-care positions are used as a filter, such that only those positions of words are considered that correspond to the match positions of the patterns. The performance of these approaches, however, depends on the underlying patterns. Herein, we show that the overlap complexity of a pattern set that was introduced by Ilie and Ilie is closely related to the variance of the number of matches between two evolutionarily related sequences with respect to this pattern set. We propose a modified hill-climbing algorithm to optimize pattern sets for database searching, read mapping and alignment-free sequence comparison of nucleic-acid sequences; our implementation of this algorithm is called rasbhari. Depending on the application at hand, rasbhari can either minimize the overlap complexity of pattern sets, maximize their sensitivity in database searching or minimize the variance of the number of pattern-based matches in alignment-free sequence comparison. We show that, for database searching, rasbhari generates pattern sets with slightly higher sensitivity than existing approaches. In our Spaced Words approach to alignment-free sequence comparison, pattern sets calculated with rasbhari led to more accurate estimates of phylogenetic distances than the randomly generated pattern sets that we previously used. Finally, we used rasbhari to generate patterns for short read classification with CLARK-S. Here too, the sensitivity of the results could be improved, compared to the default patterns of the program.

26104745,MetaQuery: a web server for rapid annotation and quantitative analysis of specific genes in the human gut microbiome.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Microbiome researchers frequently want to know how abundant a particular microbial gene or pathway is across different human hosts, including its association with disease and its co-occurrence with other genes or microbial taxa. With thousands of publicly available metagenomes, these questions should be easy to answer. However, computational barriers prevent most researchers from conducting such analyses. We address this problem with MetaQuery, a web application for rapid and quantitative analysis of specific genes in the human gut microbiome. The user inputs one or more query genes, and our software returns the estimated abundance of these genes across 1267 publicly available fecal metagenomes from American, European and Chinese individuals. In addition, our application performs downstream statistical analyses to identify features that are associated with gene variation, including other query genes (i.e. gene co-variation), taxa, clinical variables (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes) and average genome size. The speed and accessibility of MetaQuery are a step toward democratizing metagenomics research, which should allow many researchers to query the abundance and variation of specific genes in the human gut microbiome.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://metaquery.docpollard.org.<h4>Contact</h4>snayfach@gmail.comS UPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,8.0,,metaquery,,18.9011243,ok,,,,v2,0.9011243,MetaQuery,True,True,True,,http://metaquery.docpollard.org,http://metaquery.docpollard.org,True,...icrobiome.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://metaquery.docpollard.org.<h4>Contact</h4>snayfach@gmail.comS UPPLEMENTARY...,1

Currently, the BEAM server is the only web tool capable to handle tens of thousands of RNA in input with a motif discovery procedure that is only limited by the current secondary structure prediction accuracies.<h4>Results</h4>The recently developed method BEAM (BEAr Motifs finder) can analyze tens of thousands of RNA molecules and identify RNA secondary structure motifs associated to a measure of their statistical significance. BEAM is extremely fast thanks to the BEAR encoding that transforms each RNA secondary structure in a string of characters. BEAM also exploits the evolutionary knowledge contained in a substitution matrix of secondary structure elements, extracted from the RFAM database of families of homologous RNAs. The BEAM web server has been designed to streamline data pre-processing by automatically handling folding and encoding of RNA sequences, giving users a choice for the preferred folding program. The server provides an intuitive and informative results page with the list of secondary structure motifs identified, the logo of each motif, its significance, graphic representation and information about its position in the RNA molecules sharing it.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The web server is freely available at http://beam.uniroma2.it/ and it is implemented in NodeJS and Python with all major browsers supported.<h4>Contact</h4>marco.pietrosanto@uniroma2.it.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,,beam,18.8818469,ok,,,,v2,0.8818469,BEAM web server,True,False,False,,http://beam.uniroma2.it/,http://beam.uniroma2.it/,True,...ntation</h4>The web server is freely available at http://beam.uniroma2.it/ and it is implemented in NodeJS and Python with a...,1

For example, the extent of antibody neutralization of HIV-1, SIV and SHIV can be measured in the TZM-bl cell line through the degree of luciferase reporter gene expression after infection. In the past, neutralization curves and titers for this standard assay have been calculated using an Excel macro. Updating all instances of such a macro with new techniques can be unwieldy and introduce non-uniformity across multi-lab teams. Using Excel also poses challenges in centrally storing, sharing and associating raw data files and results.<h4>Results</h4>We present LabKey Server's NAb tool for organizing, analyzing and securely sharing data, files and results for neutralizing antibody (NAb) assays, including the luciferase-based TZM-bl NAb assay. The customizable tool supports high-throughput experiments and includes a graphical plate template designer, allowing researchers to quickly adapt calculations to new plate layouts. The tool calculates the percent neutralization for each serum dilution based on luminescence measurements, fits a range of neutralization curves to titration results and uses these curves to estimate the neutralizing antibody titers for benchmark dilutions. Results, curve visualizations and raw data files are stored in a database and shared through a secure, web-based interface. NAb results can be integrated with other data sources based on sample identifiers. It is simple to make results public after publication by updating folder security settings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Standardized tools for analyzing, archiving and sharing assay results can improve the reproducibility, comparability and reliability of results obtained across many labs.

22994508,The Ruby UCSC API: accessing the UCSC genome database using Ruby.,"<h4>Background</h4>The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome database is among the most used sources of genomic annotation in human and other organisms. The database offers an excellent web-based graphical user interface (the UCSC genome browser) and several means for programmatic queries. A simple application programming interface (API) in a scripting language aimed at the biologist was however not yet available. Here, we present the Ruby UCSC API, a library to access the UCSC genome database using Ruby.<h4>Results</h4>The API is designed as a BioRuby plug-in and built on the ActiveRecord 3 framework for the object-relational mapping, making writing SQL statements unnecessary. The current version of the API supports databases of all organisms in the UCSC genome database including human, mammals, vertebrates, deuterostomes, insects, nematodes, and yeast.The API uses the bin index-if available-when querying for genomic intervals. The API also supports genomic sequence queries using locally downloaded *.2bit files that are not stored in the official MySQL database. The API is implemented in pure Ruby and is therefore available in different environments and with different Ruby interpreters (including JRuby).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Assisted by the straightforward object-oriented design of Ruby and ActiveRecord, the Ruby UCSC API will facilitate biologists to query the UCSC genome database programmatically.

To study plants with unknown genome sequence, SSR markers from Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs), which can be obtained from the plant mRNA (converted to cDNA), must be utilized. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology, huge EST sequence data have been generated and are now accessible from many public databases. However, SSR marker identification from a large in-house or public EST collection requires a computational pipeline that makes use of several standard bioinformatic tools to design high quality EST-SSR primers. Some of these computational tools are not users friendly and must be tightly integrated with reference genomic databases.<h4>Results</h4>A web-based bioinformatic pipeline, called EST Analysis Pipeline Plus (ESAP Plus), was constructed for assisting researchers to develop SSR markers from a large EST collection. ESAP Plus incorporates several bioinformatic scripts and some useful standard software tools necessary for the four main procedures of EST-SSR marker development, namely 1) pre-processing, 2) clustering and assembly, 3) SSR mining and 4) SSR primer design. The proposed pipeline also provides two alternative steps for reducing EST redundancy and identifying SSR loci. Using public sugarcane ESTs, ESAP Plus automatically executed the aforementioned computational pipeline via a simple web user interface, which was implemented using standard PHP, HTML, CSS and Java scripts. With ESAP Plus, users can upload raw EST data and choose various filtering options and parameters to analyze each of the four main procedures through this web interface. All input EST data and their predicted SSR results will be stored in the ESAP Plus MySQL database. Users will be notified via e-mail when the automatic process is completed and they can download all the results through the web interface.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ESAP Plus is a comprehensive and convenient web-based bioinformatic tool for SSR marker development. ESAP Plus offers all necessary EST-SSR development processes with various adjustable options that users can easily use to identify SSR markers from a large EST collection. With familiar web interface, users can upload the raw EST using the data submission page and visualize/download the corresponding EST-SSR information from within ESAP Plus. ESAP Plus can handle considerably large EST datasets.

Although an exposure to these chemicals is suspected to have adverse effects on human health, mechanistic insights into how they interact with the human body are still limited. Therefore, acquisition of curated data and development of computational biology approaches are needed to assess the health risks of chemical exposure. Here we present HExpoChem, a tool based on environmental chemicals and their bioactivities on human proteins with the objective of aiding the qualitative exploration of human exposure to chemicals. The chemical-protein interactions have been enriched with a quality-scored human protein-protein interaction network, a protein-protein association network and a chemical-chemical interaction network, thus allowing the study of environmental chemicals through formation of protein complexes and phenotypic outcomes enrichment.<h4>Availability</h4>HExpoChem is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/HExpoChem-1.0/.",True,False,5.0,,hexpochem,,17.9993444,ok,,expochem,,v2,0.9993444,HExpoChem,True,True,True,,http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/HExpoChem-1.0/,http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/HExpoChem-1.0/,True,...nt.<h4>Availability</h4>HExpoChem is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/HExpoChem-1.0/.,1
24373374,TIPMaP: a web server to establish transcript isoform profiles from reliable microarray probes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Standard 3' Affymetrix gene expression arrays have contributed a significantly higher volume of existing gene expression data than other microarray platforms. These arrays were designed to identify differentially expressed genes, but not their alternatively spliced transcript forms. No resource can currently identify expression pattern of specific mRNA forms using these microarray data, even though it is possible to do this.<h4>Results</h4>We report a web server for expression profiling of alternatively spliced transcripts using microarray data sets from 31 standard 3' Affymetrix arrays for human, mouse and rat species. The tool has been experimentally validated for mRNAs transcribed or not-detected in a human disease condition (non-obstructive azoospermia, a male infertility condition). About 4000 gene expression datasets were downloaded from a public repository. 'Good probes' with complete coverage and identity to latest reference transcript sequences were first identified. Using them, 'Transcript specific probe-clusters' were derived for each platform and used to identify expression status of possible transcripts. The web server can lead the user to datasets corresponding to specific tissues, conditions via identifiers of the microarray studies or hybridizations, keywords, official gene symbols or reference transcript identifiers. It can identify, in the tissues and conditions of interest, about 40% of known transcripts as 'transcribed', 'not-detected' or 'differentially regulated'. Corresponding additional information for probes, genes, transcripts and proteins can be viewed too. We identified the expression of transcripts in a specific clinical condition and validated a few of these transcripts by experiments (using reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction). The experimental observations indicated higher agreements with the web server results, than contradictions. The tool is accessible at http://resource.ibab.ac.in/TIPMaP.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The newly developed online tool forms a reliable means for identification of alternatively spliced transcript-isoforms that may be differentially expressed in various tissues, cell types or physiological conditions.

27013077,HNdb: an integrated database of gene and protein information on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"The total amount of scientific literature has grown rapidly in recent years. Specifically, there are several million citations in the field of cancer. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to manually retrieve relevant information on the mechanisms that govern tumor behavior or the neoplastic process. Furthermore, cancer is a complex disease or, more accurately, a set of diseases. The heterogeneity that permeates many tumors is particularly evident in head and neck (HN) cancer, one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. In this study, we present HNdb, a free database that aims to provide a unified and comprehensive resource of information on genes and proteins involved in HN squamous cell carcinoma, covering data on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, literature citations and also cross-references of external databases. Different literature searches of MEDLINE abstracts were performed using specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) for oral, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas. A curated gene-to-publication assignment yielded a total of 1370 genes related to HN cancer. The diversity of results allowed identifying novel and mostly unexplored gene associations, revealing,for example, that processes linked to response to steroid hormone stimulus are significantly enriched in genes related to HN carcinomas.

Despite the marked variation in TB incidence across its member-states and continued human migratory flux between countries, a considerable gap in the knowledge on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis population structure and strain circulation between the countries still exists. To address this, we have assembled and analysed the largest CPLP M. tuberculosis molecular and drug susceptibility dataset, comprised by a total of 1447 clinical isolates, including 423 multidrug-resistant isolates, from five CPLP countries. The data herein presented reinforces Latin American and Mediterranean (LAM) strains as the hallmark of M. tuberculosis populational structure in the CPLP coupled with country-specific differential prevalence of minor clades.

Possible interactions (synergistic, additive or antagonistic) between these proteins can not only influence the overall efficacy of certain Bt-based bioinsecticide, but also raise questions regarding environmental safety. Here, we assemble, summarize and analyze the outcomes of experiments published over 30 years, investigating combinatorial effects among Bt Cry, Cyt and Vip toxins. We collected the results on 118 various two-to-five-component combinations that have been bioassayed against 38 invertebrate species.

However, this kind of information is limited because of the small sample size in both databases. A Genome-Wide Association Study has been conducted with 8,842 Korean subjects as a part of the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project. In an effort to build a publicly available browsing system for genome data resulted from large scale KARE GWAS, we developed the KARE browser. This browser provides users with a large amount of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) information comprising 1.5 million SNPs from population-based cohorts of 8,842 samples. KAREBrowser was based on the generic genome browser (GBrowse), a webbased application tool developed for users to navigate and visualize the genomic features and annotations in an interactive manner.

33676930,The DBSAV Database: Predicting Deleteriousness of Single Amino Acid Variations in the Human Proteome.,"Deleterious single amino acid variation (SAV) is one of the leading causes of human diseases. Evaluating the functional impact of SAVs is crucial for diagnosis of genetic disorders. We previously developed a deep convolutional neural network predictor, DeepSAV, to evaluate the deleterious effects of SAVs on protein function based on various sequence, structural, and functional properties. DeepSAV scores of rare SAVs observed in the human population are aggregated into a gene-level score called GTS (Gene Tolerance of rare SAVs) that reflects a gene's tolerance to deleterious missense mutations and serves as a useful tool to study gene-disease associations. In this study, we aim to enhance the performance of DeepSAV by using expanded datasets of pathogenic and benign variants, more features, and neural network optimization. We found that multiple sequence alignments built from vertebrate-level orthologs yield better prediction results compared to those built from mammalian-level orthologs. For multiple sequence alignments built from BLAST searches, optimal performance was achieved with a sequence identify cutoff of 50% to remove distant homologs. The new version of DeepSAV exhibits the best performance among standalone predictors of deleterious effects of SAVs. We developed the DBSAV database (http://prodata.swmed.edu/DBSAV) that reports GTS scores of human genes and DeepSAV scores of SAVs in the human proteome, including pathogenic and benign SAVs, population-level SAVs, and all possible SAVs by single nucleotide variations.

33985559,TGIF-DB: terse genomics interface for developing botany.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is a staple cereal crop for semi-arid regions. Its whole genome sequence and deduced putative gene sequences are available. However, the functions of many pearl millet genes are unknown. Situations are similar for other crop species such as garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis), chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum). The objective of the data presented here was to improve functional annotations of genes of pearl millet, garden asparagus, chickpea and Tartary buckwheat with gene annotations of model plants, to systematically provide such annotations as well as their sequences on a website, and thereby to promote genomics for those crops.<h4>Data description</h4>Sequences of genomes and transcripts of pearl millet, garden asparagus, chickpea and Tartary buckwheat were downloaded from a public database. These transcripts were associated with functional annotations of their Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) counterparts identified by BLASTX. Conserved domains in protein sequences of those species were identified by the HMMER scan with the Pfam database.

26475471,NeuroTransDB: highly curated and structured transcriptomic metadata for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic debilitating conditions, characterized by progressive loss of neurons that represent a significant health care burden as the global elderly population continues to grow. Over the past decade, high-throughput technologies such as the Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays have provided new perspectives into the pathomechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. Public transcriptomic data repositories, namely Gene Expression Omnibus and curated ArrayExpress, enable researchers to conduct integrative meta-analysis; increasing the power to detect differentially regulated genes in disease and explore patterns of gene dysregulation across biologically related studies. The reliability of retrospective, large-scale integrative analyses depends on an appropriate combination of related datasets, in turn requiring detailed meta-annotations capturing the experimental setup. In most cases, we observe huge variation in compliance to defined standards for submitted metadata in public databases. Much of the information to complete, or refine meta-annotations are distributed in the associated publications. For example, tissue preparation or comorbidity information is frequently described in an article's supplementary tables. Several value-added databases have employed additional manual efforts to overcome this limitation. However, none of these databases explicate annotations that distinguish human and animal models in neurodegeneration context. Therefore, adopting a more specific disease focus, in combination with dedicated disease ontologies, will better empower the selection of comparable studies with refined annotations to address the research question at hand. In this article, we describe the detailed development of NeuroTransDB, a manually curated database containing metadata annotations for neurodegenerative studies. The database contains more than 20 dimensions of metadata annotations within 31 mouse, 5 rat and 45 human studies, defined in collaboration with domain disease experts. We elucidate the step-by-step guidelines used to critically prioritize studies from public archives and their metadata curation and discuss the key challenges encountered. Curated metadata for Alzheimer's disease gene expression studies are available for download.

28005526,Introducing EzBioCloud: a taxonomically united database of 16S rRNA gene sequences and whole-genome assemblies.,"The recent advent of DNA sequencing technologies facilitates the use of genome sequencing data that provide means for more informative and precise classification and identification of members of the Bacteria and Archaea. Because the current species definition is based on the comparison of genome sequences between type and other strains in a given species, building a genome database with correct taxonomic information is of paramount need to enhance our efforts in exploring prokaryotic diversity and discovering novel species as well as for routine identifications. Here we introduce an integrated database, called EzBioCloud, that holds the taxonomic hierarchy of the Bacteria and Archaea, which is represented by quality-controlled 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences. Whole-genome assemblies in the NCBI Assembly Database were screened for low quality and subjected to a composite identification bioinformatics pipeline that employs gene-based searches followed by the calculation of average nucleotide identity. As a result, the database is made of 61 700 species/phylotypes, including 13 132 with validly published names, and 62 362 whole-genome assemblies that were identified taxonomically at the genus, species and subspecies levels. Genomic properties, such as genome size and DNA G+C content, and the occurrence in human microbiome data were calculated for each genus or higher taxa. This united database of taxonomy, 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences, with accompanying bioinformatics tools, should accelerate genome-based classification and identification of members of the Bacteria and Archaea.

Its high medicinal value has long been recognized by traditional Chinese medicine (as <i>Radix paeoniae Alba</i> and <i>Radix paeoniae Rubra</i>), and it has become economically valued for its oilseed in recent years; like other <i>Paeonia</i> species, it has been identified as a novel resource for the α-linolenic acid used in seed oil production. However, its genome has not yet been sequenced, and little transcriptome data on <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> are available. To obtain a comprehensive transcriptome for <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i>, RNAs from 10 tissues of the <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> Pall. cv Shaoyou17C were used for <i>de novo</i> assembly, and 416,062 unigenes were obtained. Using a homology search, it was found that 236,222 (approximately 57%) unigenes had at least one BLAST hit in one or more public data resources. The construction of co-expression networks is a feasible means for improving unigene annotation. Using in-house transcriptome data, we obtained a co-expression network covering 95.13% of the unigenes. Then we integrated co-expression network analyses and lipid-related pathway genes to study lipid metabolism in <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> cultivars. Finally, we constructed the online database HpeNet (http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/HpeNet) to integrate transcriptome data, gene information, the co-expression network, and so forth. The database can also be searched for gene details, gene functions, orthologous matches, and other data.

21227933,ARTADE2DB: improved statistical inferences for Arabidopsis gene functions and structure predictions by dynamic structure-based dynamic expression (DSDE) analyses.,"Recent advances in technologies for observing high-resolution genomic activities, such as whole-genome tiling arrays and high-throughput sequencers, provide detailed information for understanding genome functions. However, the functions of 50% of known Arabidopsis thaliana genes remain unknown or are annotated only on the basis of static analyses such as protein motifs or similarities. In this paper, we describe dynamic structure-based dynamic expression (DSDE) analysis, which sequentially predicts both structural and functional features of transcripts. We show that DSDE analysis inferred gene functions 12% more precisely than static structure-based dynamic expression (SSDE) analysis or conventional co-expression analysis based on previously determined gene structures of A. thaliana. This result suggests that more precise structural information than the fixed conventional annotated structures is crucial for co-expression analysis in systems biology of transcriptional regulation and dynamics. Our DSDE method, ARabidopsis Tiling-Array-based Detection of Exons version 2 and over-representation analysis (ARTADE2-ORA), precisely predicts each gene structure by combining two statistical analyses: a probe-wise co-expression analysis of multiple transcriptome measurements and a Markov model analysis of genome sequences. ARTADE2-ORA successfully identified the true functions of about 90% of functionally annotated genes, inferred the functions of 98% of functionally unknown genes and predicted 1,489 new gene structures and functions. We developed a database ARTADE2DB that integrates not only the information predicted by ARTADE2-ORA but also annotations and other functional information, such as phenotypes and literature citations, and is expected to contribute to the study of the functional genomics of A. thaliana.

While dedicated registries are generally tied to a particular format, general-purpose ones are more adherent to standards and usually rely on Web Service Definition Language (WSDL). Although WSDL is quite flexible to support common Web services types, its lack of semantic expressiveness led to various initiatives to describe Web services via ontology languages. Nevertheless, WSDL 2.0 descriptions gained a standard representation based on Web Ontology Language (OWL). BioSWR is a novel Web services registry that provides standard Resource Description Framework (RDF) based Web services descriptions along with the traditional WSDL based ones.

Recent advances in this field have also allowed the first attempts to apply these techniques to the clinical practice. Nowadays, the main progress in Computational Proteomics is based on the integration of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic experimental data, what is known as Proteogenomics. This methodology is being especially useful for the discovery of new clinical biomarkers, small open reading frames and microproteins, although their validation is still challenging.<h4>Results</h4>We detected novel peptides following a proteogenomic workflow based on the MiTranscriptome human assembly and shotgun experiments. The annotation approach generated three custom databases with the corresponding peptides of known and novel transcripts of both protein coding genes and non-coding genes. In addition, we used a peptide detectability filter to improve the computational performance of the proteomic searches, the statistical analysis and the robustness of the results. These innovative additional filters are specially relevant when noisy next generation sequencing experiments are used to generate the databases. This resource, MiTPeptideDB, was validated using 43 cell lines for which RNA-Seq experiments and shotgun experiments were available.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MiTPeptideDB is available at http://bit.ly/MiTPeptideDB.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,3.0,,mitpeptidedb,,17.9982304,ok,,itpeptidedb,,v2,0.9982304,MiTPeptideDB,True,True,True,,http://bit.ly/MiTPeptideDB,http://bit.ly/MiTPeptideDB,True,...d implementation</h4>MiTPeptideDB is available at http://bit.ly/MiTPeptideDB.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1

30280028,Xeno-miRNet: a comprehensive database and analytics platform to explore xeno-miRNAs and their potential targets.,"Xeno-miRNAs are microRNAs originating from exogenous species detected in host biofluids. A growing number of studies have suggested that many of these xeno-miRNAs may be involved in cross-species interactions and manipulations. To date, hundreds of xeno-miRNAs have been reported in different hosts at various abundance levels. Based on computational predictions, many more miRNAs could be potentially transferred to human circulation system. There is a clear need for bioinformatics resources and tools dedicated to xeno-miRNA annotations and their potential functions. To address this need, we have systematically curated xeno-miRNAs from multiple sources, performed target predictions using well-established algorithms, and developed a user-friendly web-based tool-Xeno-miRNet-to allow researchers to search and explore xeno-miRNAs and their potential targets within different host species.

26019179,sRNAtoolbox: an integrated collection of small RNA research tools.,"Small RNA research is a rapidly growing field. Apart from microRNAs, which are important regulators of gene expression, other types of functional small RNA molecules have been reported in animals and plants. MicroRNAs are important in host-microbe interactions and parasite microRNAs might modulate the innate immunity of the host. Furthermore, small RNAs can be detected in bodily fluids making them attractive non-invasive biomarker candidates. Given the general broad interest in small RNAs, and in particular microRNAs, a large number of bioinformatics aided analysis types are needed by the scientific community. To facilitate integrated sRNA research, we developed sRNAtoolbox, a set of independent but interconnected tools for expression profiling from high-throughput sequencing data, consensus differential expression, target gene prediction, visual exploration in a genome context as a function of read length, gene list analysis and blast search of unmapped reads. All tools can be used independently or for the exploration and downstream analysis of sRNAbench results. Workflows like the prediction of consensus target genes of parasite microRNAs in the host followed by the detection of enriched pathways can be easily established.

In this article, we present the mTM-align server, which consists of two closely related modules: one for structure database search and the other for multiple structure alignment. The database search is speeded up based on a heuristic algorithm and a hierarchical organization of the structures in the database. The multiple structure alignment is performed using the recently developed algorithm mTM-align. Benchmark tests demonstrate that our algorithms outperform other peering methods for both modules, in terms of speed and accuracy. One of the unique features for the server is the interplay between database search and multiple structure alignment. The server provides service not only for performing fast database search, but also for making accurate multiple structure alignment with the structures found by the search. For the database search, it takes about 2-5 min for a structure of a medium size (∼300 residues). For the multiple structure alignment, it takes a few seconds for ∼10 structures of medium sizes.

One of the clinically most useful advantages of WGS is the ability to predict antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in bacterial sequences. This allows comprehensive investigations of such genetic features but can also be used for epidemiological studies. A plethora of software programs have been developed for the detailed annotation of bacterial DNA sequences, such as rapid annotation using subsystem technology (RAST), Resfinder, ISfinder, INTEGRALL and The Transposon Registry. Unfortunately, to this day, a reliable annotation tool of the combination of ARGs and MGEs is not available, and the generation of genbank files requires much manual input.

34301175,PDBeCIF: an open-source mmCIF/CIF parsing and processing package.,"<h4>Background</h4>Biomacromolecular structural data outgrew the legacy Protein Data Bank (PDB) format which the scientific community relied on for decades, yet the use of its successor PDBx/Macromolecular Crystallographic Information File format (PDBx/mmCIF) is still not widespread. Perhaps one of the reasons is the availability of easy to use tools that only support the legacy format, but also the inherent difficulties of processing mmCIF files correctly, given the number of edge cases that make efficient parsing problematic. Nevertheless, to fully exploit macromolecular structure data and their associated annotations such as multiscale structures from integrative/hybrid methods or large macromolecular complexes determined using traditional methods, it is necessary to fully adopt the new format as soon as possible.<h4>Results</h4>To this end, we developed PDBeCIF, an open-source Python project for manipulating mmCIF and CIF files.

These signatures are instrumental in the identification of biomarkers or classification of individuals, however their biological and physiological interpretation remains a challenge. To support this task, we introduce FORUM: a Knowledge Graph (KG) providing a semantic representation of relations between chemicals and biomedical concepts, built from a federation of life science databases and scientific literature repositories.<h4>Results</h4>The use of a Semantic Web framework on biological data allows us to apply ontological-based reasoning to infer new relations between entities.

28263070,Param-Medic: A Tool for Improving MS/MS Database Search Yield by Optimizing Parameter Settings.,"In shotgun proteomics analysis, user-specified parameters are critical to database search performance and therefore to the yield of confident peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). Two of the most important parameters are related to the accuracy of the mass spectrometer. Precursor mass tolerance defines the peptide candidates considered for each spectrum. Fragment mass tolerance or bin size determines how close observed and theoretical fragments must be to be considered a match. For either of these two parameters, too wide a setting yields randomly high-scoring false PSMs, whereas too narrow a setting erroneously excludes true PSMs, in both cases, lowering the yield of peptides detected at a given false discovery rate. We describe a strategy for inferring optimal search parameters by assembling and analyzing pairs of spectra that are likely to have been generated by the same peptide ion to infer precursor and fragment mass error. This strategy does not rely on a database search, making it usable in a wide variety of settings. In our experiments on data from a variety of instruments including Orbitrap and Q-TOF acquisitions, this strategy yields more high-confidence PSMs than using settings based on instrument defaults or determined by experts.

27717309,RStrucFam: a web server to associate structure and cognate RNA for RNA-binding proteins from sequence information.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with their cognate RNA(s) to form large biomolecular assemblies. They are versatile in their functionality and are involved in a myriad of processes inside the cell. RBPs with similar structural features and common biological functions are grouped together into families and superfamilies. It will be useful to obtain an early understanding and association of RNA-binding property of sequences of gene products. Here, we report a web server, RStrucFam, to predict the structure, type of cognate RNA(s) and function(s) of proteins, where possible, from mere sequence information.<h4>Results</h4>The web server employs Hidden Markov Model scan (hmmscan) to enable association to a back-end database of structural and sequence families. The database (HMMRBP) comprises of 437 HMMs of RBP families of known structure that have been generated using structure-based sequence alignments and 746 sequence-centric RBP family HMMs. The input protein sequence is associated with structural or sequence domain families, if structure or sequence signatures exist. In case of association of the protein with a family of known structures, output features like, multiple structure-based sequence alignment (MSSA) of the query with all others members of that family is provided. Further, cognate RNA partner(s) for that protein, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, if any and a homology model of the protein can be obtained. The users can also browse through the database for details pertaining to each family, protein or RNA and their related information based on keyword search or RNA motif search.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RStrucFam is a web server that exploits structurally conserved features of RBPs, derived from known family members and imprinted in mathematical profiles, to predict putative RBPs from sequence information. Proteins that fail to associate with such structure-centric families are further queried against the sequence-centric RBP family HMMs in the HMMRBP database. Further, all other essential information pertaining to an RBP, like overall function annotations, are provided.

30251842,ADMETopt: A Web Server for ADMET Optimization in Drug Design via Scaffold Hopping.,"Drug-likeness, comprising absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties, plays a significant role in early drug discovery. However, as for current strategies of lead optimization, in vitro potency is still the focus, which may cause ""molecular obesity"" (poor ADMET properties). Therefore, optimization of ADMET properties would be a preferable complement for drug discovery. In this paper, we present a web server, ADMETopt, that applies scaffold hopping and ADMET screening for lead optimization. More than 50 000 unique scaffolds were extracted by fragmenting chemicals deposited in the ChEMBL and Enamine databases. Up to 15 ADMET properties can be predicted to screen the potential molecules, including seven physicochemical properties and eight biological properties. All of the models were built in terms of our previous studies and are available in our web server admetSAR. For the plausibility measurement of the modified molecules, synthetic accessibility and quantitative evaluation of drug-likeness were then implemented. As a case study, a scaffold similarity network was constructed for compounds that have bioactivities on estrogen receptors. The results demonstrated that the feasibility and practicability of our web server are acceptable.

29341109,The prescribable drugs with efficacy in experimental epilepsies (PDE3) database for drug repurposing research in epilepsy.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have several shortcomings. For example, they fail to control seizures in 30% of patients. Hence, there is a need to identify new AEDs. Drug repurposing is the discovery of new indications for approved drugs. This drug ""recycling"" offers the potential of significant savings in the time and cost of drug development. Many drugs licensed for other indications exhibit antiepileptic efficacy in animal models. Our aim was to create a database of ""prescribable"" drugs, approved for other conditions, with published evidence of efficacy in animal models of epilepsy, and to collate data that would assist in choosing the most promising candidates for drug repurposing.<h4>Methods</h4>The database was created by the following: (1) computational literature-mining using novel software that identifies Medline abstracts containing the name of a prescribable drug, a rodent model of epilepsy, and a phrase indicating seizure reduction; then (2) crowdsourced manual curation of the identified abstracts.<h4>Results</h4>The final database includes 173 drugs and 500 abstracts. It is made freely available at www.liverpool.ac.uk/D3RE/PDE3. The database is reliable: 94% of the included drugs have corroborative evidence of efficacy in animal models (for example, evidence from multiple independent studies). The database includes many drugs that are appealing candidates for repurposing, as they are widely accepted by prescribers and patients-the database includes half of the 20 most commonly prescribed drugs in England-and they target many proteins involved in epilepsy but not targeted by current AEDs. It is important to note that the drugs are of potential relevance to human epilepsy-the database is highly enriched with drugs that target proteins of known causal human epilepsy genes (Fisher's exact test P-value < 3 × 10<sup>-5</sup> ). We present data to help prioritize the most promising candidates for repurposing from the database.<h4>Significance</h4>The PDE3 database is an important new resource for drug repurposing research in epilepsy.",True,False,4.0,,,pde3,17.995549099999998,ok,,,,v2,0.9955491,,True,False,False,,http://www.liverpool.ac.uk/D3RE/PDE3,http://www.liverpool.ac.uk/D3RE/PDE3,True,,1
25527097,CDvist: a webserver for identification and visualization of conserved domains in protein sequences.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Identification of domains in protein sequences allows their assigning to biological functions. Several webservers exist for identification of protein domains using similarity searches against various databases of protein domain models. However, none of them provides comprehensive domain coverage while allowing bulk querying and their visualization schemes can be improved. To address these issues, we developed CDvist (a comprehensive domain visualization tool), which combines the best available search algorithms and databases into a user-friendly framework. First, a given protein sequence is matched to domain models using high-specificity tools and only then unmatched segments are subjected to more sensitive algorithms resulting in a best possible comprehensive coverage. Bulk querying and rich visualization and download options provide improved functionality to domain architecture analysis.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Freely available on the web at http://cdvist.utk.edu<h4>Contact</h4>oadebali@vols.utk.edu or ijouline@utk.edu.",True,False,7.0,,,cdvist,17.9953801,ok,,,,v2,0.9953801,CDvist,True,True,True,,http://cdvist.utk.edu,http://cdvist.utk.edu,True,...implementation</h4>Freely available on the web at http://cdvist.utk.edu<h4>Contact</h4>oadebali@vols.utk.edu or ijouline@...,1
22373022,iGepros: an integrated gene and protein annotation server for biological nature exploration.,"<h4>Background</h4>In the post-genomic era, transcriptomics and proteomics provide important information to understand the genomes. With fast development of high-throughput technology, more and more transcriptomics and proteomics data are generated at an unprecedented rate. Therefore, requirement of software to annotate those omics data and explore their biological nature arises. In the past decade, some pioneer works were presented to address this issue, but limitations still exist. Fox example, some of these tools offer command line only, which is not suitable for those users with little or no experience in programming. Besides, some tools don't support large scale gene and protein analysis.<h4>Results</h4>To overcome these limitations, an integrated gene and protein annotation server named iGepros has been developed. The server provides user-friendly interfaces and detailed on-line examples, so most researchers even those with little or no programming experience can use it smoothly. Moreover, the server provides many functionalities to compare transcriptomics and proteomics data. Especially, the server is constructed under a model-view-control framework, which makes it easy to incorporate more functions to the server in the future.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this paper, we present a server with powerful capability not only for gene and protein functional annotation, but also for transcriptomics and proteomics data comparison. Researchers can survey biological characters behind gene and protein datasets and accelerate their investigation of transcriptome and proteome by applying the server.

34321100,Distinct signatures of codon and codon pair usage in 32 primary tumor types in the novel database CancerCoCoPUTs for cancer-specific codon usage.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene expression is highly variable across tissues of multi-cellular organisms, influencing the codon usage of the tissue-specific transcriptome. Cancer disrupts the gene expression pattern of healthy tissue resulting in altered codon usage preferences. The topic of codon usage changes as they relate to codon demand, and tRNA supply in cancer is of growing interest.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed transcriptome-weighted codon and codon pair usage based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq data from 6427 solid tumor samples and 632 normal tissue samples. This dataset represents 32 cancer types affecting 11 distinct tissues. Our analysis focused on tissues that give rise to multiple solid tumor types and cancer types that are present in multiple tissues.<h4>Results</h4>We identified distinct patterns of synonymous codon usage changes for different cancer types affecting the same tissue. For example, a substantial increase in GGT-glycine was observed in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (IDLC) of the breast. Change in synonymous codon preference favoring GGT correlated with change in synonymous codon preference against GGC in IDC and IDLC, but not in ILC. Furthermore, we examined the codon usage changes between paired healthy/tumor tissue from the same patient. Using clinical data from TCGA, we conducted a survival analysis of patients based on the degree of change between healthy and tumor-specific codon usage, revealing an association between larger changes and increased mortality. We have also created a database that contains cancer-specific codon and codon pair usage data for cancer types derived from TCGA, which represents a comprehensive tool for codon-usage-oriented cancer research.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on data from TCGA, we have highlighted tumor type-specific signatures of codon and codon pair usage. Paired data revealed variable changes to codon usage patterns, which must be considered when designing personalized cancer treatments. The associated database, CancerCoCoPUTs, represents a comprehensive resource for codon and codon pair usage in cancer and is available at https://dnahive.fda.gov/review/cancercocoputs/ .

25760404,BaAMPs: the database of biofilm-active antimicrobial peptides.,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are increasingly being considered as novel agents against biofilms. The development of AMP-based anti-biofilm strategies strongly relies on the design of sequences optimized to target specific features of sessile bacterial/fungal communities. Although several AMP databases have been created and successfully exploited for AMP design, all of these use data collected on peptides tested against planktonic microorganisms. Here, an open-access, manually curated database of AMPs specifically assayed against microbial biofilms (BaAMPs) is presented for the first time. In collecting relevant data from the literature an effort was made to define a minimal standard set of essential information including, for each AMP, the microbial species and biofilm conditions against which it was tested, and the specific assay and peptide concentration used.

33304465,HARP: a database of structural impacts of systematic missense mutations in drug targets of <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i>.,"Computational Saturation Mutagenesis is an <i>in-silico</i> approach that employs systematic mutagenesis of each amino acid residue in the protein to all other amino acid types, and predicts changes in thermodynamic stability and affinity to the other subunits/protein counterparts, ligands and nucleic acid molecules. The data thus generated are useful in understanding the functional consequences of mutations in antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. In this study, we applied computational saturation mutagenesis to three important drug-targets in <i>Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae)</i> for the drugs dapsone, rifampin and ofloxacin namely Dihydropteroate Synthase (DHPS), RNA Polymerase (RNAP) and DNA Gyrase (GYR), respectively. <i>M. leprae</i> causes leprosy and is an obligate intracellular bacillus with limited protein structural information associating mutations with phenotypic resistance outcomes in leprosy. Experimentally solved structures of DHPS, RNAP and GYR of <i>M. leprae</i> are not available in the Protein Data Bank, therefore, we modelled the structures of these proteins using template-based comparative modelling and introduced systematic mutations in each model generating 80,902 mutations and mutant structures for all the three proteins. Impacts of mutations on stability and protein-subunit, protein-ligand and protein-nucleic acid affinities were computed using various in-house developed and other published protein stability and affinity prediction software.

Thus, in this work, we selected drug-target pairs (DTPs/nDTPs) of drugs with high affinity/nonaffinity for different targets. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models become a very useful tool in this context because they substantially reduce time and resource-consuming experiments. Unfortunately, most QSAR models predict activity against only one protein target and/or they have not been implemented on a public Web server yet, freely available online to the scientific community. To solve this problem, we developed a multitarget QSAR (mt-QSAR) classifier combining the MARCH-INSIDE software for the calculation of the structural parameters of drug and target with the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method in order to seek the best model.

30535305,PopViz: a webserver for visualizing minor allele frequencies and damage prediction scores of human genetic variations.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) generates large amounts of genomic data and reveals about 20 000 genetic coding variants per individual studied. Several mutation damage prediction scores are available to prioritize variants, but there is currently no application to help investigators to determine the relevance of the candidate genes and variants quickly and visually from population genetics data and deleteriousness scores. Here, we present PopViz, a user-friendly, rapid, interactive, mobile-compatible webserver providing a gene-centric visualization of the variants of any human gene, with (i) population-specific minor allele frequencies from the gnomAD population genetic database; (ii) mutation damage prediction scores from CADD, EIGEN and LINSIGHT and (iii) amino-acid positions and protein domains. This application will be particularly useful in investigations of NGS data for new disease-causing genes and variants, by reinforcing or rejecting the plausibility of the candidate genes, and by selecting and prioritizing, the candidate variants for experimental testing.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PopViz webserver is freely accessible from http://shiva.rockefeller.edu/PopViz/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,7.0,,,popviz,17.99194986,ok,,,gnomad | opviz,v2,0.99194986,PopViz,True,True,True,,http://shiva.rockefeller.edu/PopViz/,http://shiva.rockefeller.edu/PopViz/,True,...on</h4>PopViz webserver is freely accessible from http://shiva.rockefeller.edu/PopViz/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1

21558322,DRAR-CPI: a server for identifying drug repositioning potential and adverse drug reactions via the chemical-protein interactome.,"Identifying new indications for existing drugs (drug repositioning) is an efficient way of maximizing their potential. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is one of the leading causes of death among hospitalized patients. As both new indications and ADRs are caused by unexpected chemical-protein interactions on off-targets, it is reasonable to predict these interactions by mining the chemical-protein interactome (CPI). Making such predictions has recently been facilitated by a web server named DRAR-CPI. This server has a representative collection of drug molecules and targetable human proteins built up from our work in drug repositioning and ADR. When a user submits a molecule, the server will give the positive or negative association scores between the user's molecule and our library drugs based on their interaction profiles towards the targets. Users can thus predict the indications or ADRs of their molecule based on the association scores towards our library drugs. We have matched our predictions of drug-drug associations with those predicted via gene-expression profiles, achieving a matching rate as high as 74%. We have also successfully predicted the connections between anti-psychotics and anti-infectives, indicating the underlying relevance of anti-psychotics in the potential treatment of infections, vice versa.

21277861,NL MIND-BEST: a web server for ligands and proteins discovery--theoretic-experimental study of proteins of Giardia lamblia and new compounds active against Plasmodium falciparum.,"There are many protein ligands and/or drugs described with very different affinity to a large number of target proteins or receptors. In this work, we selected Ligands or Drug-target pairs (DTPs/nDTPs) of drugs with high affinity/non-affinity for different targets. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models become a very useful tool in this context to substantially reduce time and resources consuming experiments. Unfortunately most QSAR models predict activity against only one protein target and/or have not been implemented in the form of public web server freely accessible online to the scientific community. To solve this problem, we developed here a multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) classifier using the MARCH-INSIDE technique to calculate structural parameters of drug and target plus one Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) to seek the model. The best ANN model found is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with profile MLP 20:20-15-1:1. This MLP classifies correctly 611 out of 678 DTPs (sensitivity=90.12%) and 3083 out of 3408 nDTPs (specificity=90.46%), corresponding to training accuracy=90.41%. The validation of the model was carried out by means of external predicting series. The model classifies correctly 310 out of 338 DTPs (sensitivity=91.72%) and 1527 out of 1674 nDTP (specificity=91.22%) in validation series, corresponding to total accuracy=91.30% for validation series (predictability). This model favorably compares with other ANN models developed in this work and Machine Learning classifiers published before to address the same problem in different aspects.

Here, we present a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora with a focus on fruit development using publicly available expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Most of the fruit and seed EST data has been obtained from C. canephora. Therefore, we performed a fruit EST analysis of the 5 developmental stages of this species (18, 22, 30, 42, and 46 weeks after flowering) comprising 29,009 sequences.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which provide high-resolution insight into biomolecular function and underlying mechanisms, are in principle ideally suited to tackle this problem. However, because of the challenges associated with the development of novel MD parameters and a general lack of suitable computational tools for incorporating PTMs in target protein structures, MD simulations of post-translationally modified proteins have historically lagged significantly behind the studies of unmodified proteins.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography structures of ribosomal particles, alone and in complex with diverse ligands (protein factors, RNAs and small molecules), have revealed the dynamic nature of the ribosome and provided much needed insight into translation and its regulation. In the past years, there has been exponential growth in the deposition of cryo-EM maps into the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) as well as atomic structures into the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Using known disease gene information from OMIM, the system predicts and prioritizes disease gene candidates that participate in the same protein pathways or share similar protein domains. Alternatively, using an ab initio approach, the system can detect enrichment of these protein annotations without prior knowledge of the phenotype.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The system aims to integrate the wealth of protein information currently available with known and novel phenotype/genotype information to acquire knowledge of biological mechanisms underpinning disease. We have updated the system to facilitate analysis of GWAS data and the study of complex diseases. Application of the system to GWAS data on hypertension using the ICBP data is provided as an example.

21943292,EnzymeDetector: an integrated enzyme function prediction tool and database.,"<h4>Background</h4>The ability to accurately predict enzymatic functions is an essential prerequisite for the interpretation of cellular functions, and the reconstruction and analysis of metabolic models. Several biological databases exist that provide such information. However, in many cases these databases provide partly different and inconsistent genome annotations.<h4>Description</h4>We analysed nine prokaryotic genomes and found about 70% inconsistencies in the enzyme predictions of the main annotation resources. Therefore, we implemented the annotation pipeline EnzymeDetector. This tool automatically compares and evaluates the assigned enzyme functions from the main annotation databases and supplements them with its own function prediction. This is based on a sequence similarity analysis, on manually created organism-specific enzyme information from BRENDA (Braunschweig Enzyme Database), and on sequence pattern searches.<h4>Conclusions</h4>EnzymeDetector provides a fast and comprehensive overview of the available enzyme function annotations for a genome of interest. The web interface allows the user to work with customisable weighting schemes and cut-offs for the different prediction methods. These customised quality criteria can easily be applied, and the resulting annotation can be downloaded. The summarised view of all used annotation sources provides up-to-date information. Annotation errors that occur in only one of the databases can be recognised (because of their low relevance score).

In E.coli the main classes of chaperones that interact with the nascent chain are trigger factor, DnaK/J and GroEL/ES and several authors have performed whole-genome experiments to construct exhaustive client lists for each of these.<h4>Results</h4>We constructed a database collecting all publicly available data of experimental chaperone-interaction and -dependency data for the E.coli proteome, and enriched it with an extensive set of protein-specific as well as cell context-dependent proteostatic parameters. We made this publicly accessible via a web interface that allows to search for proteins or chaperone client lists, but also to profile user-specified datasets against all the collected parameters.

22768229,MetaboSearch: tool for mass-based metabolite identification using multiple databases.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Searching metabolites against databases according to their masses is often the first step in metabolite identification for a mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics study. Major metabolite databases include Human Metabolome DataBase (HMDB), Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), Metlin, and LIPID MAPS. Since each one of these databases covers only a fraction of the metabolome, integration of the search results from these databases is expected to yield a more comprehensive coverage. However, the manual combination of multiple search results is generally difficult when identification of hundreds of metabolites is desired. We have implemented a web-based software tool that enables simultaneous mass-based search against the four major databases, and the integration of the results. In addition, more complete chemical identifier information for the metabolites is retrieved by cross-referencing multiple databases. The search results are merged based on IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) keys. Besides a simple list of m/z values, the software can accept the ion annotation information as input for enhanced metabolite identification. The performance of the software is demonstrated on mass spectrometry data acquired in both positive and negative ionization modes. Compared with search results from individual databases, MetaboSearch provides better coverage of the metabolome and more complete chemical identifier information.<h4>Availability</h4>The software tool is available at http://omics.georgetown.edu/MetaboSearch.html.",True,False,3.0,,metabosearch,,17.98023635,ok,,,hmdb | maps,v2,0.98023635,MetaboSearch,True,True,True,,http://omics.georgetown.edu/MetaboSearch.html,http://omics.georgetown.edu/MetaboSearch.html,True,...vailability</h4>The software tool is available at http://omics.georgetown.edu/MetaboSearch.html.,1
29037173,"TaxMapper: an analysis tool, reference database and workflow for metatranscriptome analysis of eukaryotic microorganisms.","<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are increasingly applied to analyse complex microbial ecosystems by mRNA sequencing of whole communities, also known as metatranscriptome sequencing. This approach is at the moment largely limited to prokaryotic communities and communities of few eukaryotic species with sequenced genomes. For eukaryotes the analysis is hindered mainly by a low and fragmented coverage of the reference databases to infer the community composition, but also by lack of automated workflows for the task.<h4>Results</h4>From the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project, 142 references were selected in such a way that the taxa represent the main lineages within each of the seven supergroups of eukaryotes and possess predominantly complete transcriptomes or genomes. From these references, we created an annotated microeukaryotic reference database. We developed a tool called TaxMapper for a reliably mapping of sequencing reads against this database and filtering of unreliable assignments. For filtering, a classifier was trained and tested on each of the following: sequences of taxa in the database, sequences of taxa related to those in the database, and random sequences. Additionally, TaxMapper is part of a metatranscriptomic Snakemake workflow developed to perform quality assessment, functional and taxonomic annotation and (multivariate) statistical analysis including environmental data. The workflow is provided and described in detail to empower researchers to apply it for metatranscriptome analysis of any environmental sample.<h4>Conclusions</h4>TaxMapper shows superior performance compared to standard approaches, resulting in a higher number of true positive taxonomic assignments.

23640335,CMCompare webserver: comparing RNA families via covariance models.,"A standard method for the identification of novel non-coding RNAs is homology search by covariance models. Covariance models are constructed for specific RNA families with common sequence and structure (e.g. transfer RNAs). Currently, there are models for 2208 families available from Rfam. Before being included into a database, a proposed family should be tested for specificity (finding only true homolog sequences), sensitivity (finding remote homologs) and uniqueness. The CMCompare webserver (CMCws) compares Infernal RNA family models to (i) identify models with poor specificity and (ii) explore the relationship between models. The CMCws provides options to compare new models against all existing models in the current Rfam database to avoid the construction of duplicate models for the same non-coding RNA family. In addition, the user can explore the relationship between two or more models, including whole sets of user-created family models. Visualization of family relationships provides help in evaluating candidates for clusters of biologically related families, called clans.

These data have been widely used, for example, to predict properties of populations retrospectively or prospectively according to mathematically intractable genetic models, and to assist the validation, statistical inference and power analysis of a variety of statistical models. However, owing to the differences in type of genetic data of interest, simulation methods, evolutionary features, input and output formats, terminologies and assumptions for different applications, choosing the right tool for a particular study can be a resource-intensive process that usually involves searching, downloading and testing many different simulation programs. Genetic Simulation Resources (GSR) is a website provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that aims to help researchers compare and choose the appropriate simulation tools for their studies.

24334415,"HapRice, an SNP haplotype database and a web tool for rice.","Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis is a promising tool to examine the genetic diversity of rice populations and genetic traits of scientific and economic importance. Next-generation sequencing technology has accelerated the re-sequencing of diverse rice varieties and the discovery of genome-wide SNPs. Notably, validation of these SNPs by a high-throughput genotyping system, such as an SNP array, could provide a manageable and highly accurate SNP set. To enhance the potential utility of genome-wide SNPs for geneticists and breeders, analysis tools need to be developed. Here, we constructed an SNP haplotype database, which allows visualization of the allele frequency of all SNPs in the genome browser. We calculated the allele frequencies of 3,334 SNPs in 76 accessions from the world rice collection and 3,252 SNPs in 177 Japanese rice accessions; all these SNPs have been validated in our previous studies. The SNP haplotypes were defined by the allele frequency in each cultivar group (aus, indica, tropical japonica and temperate japonica) for the world rice accessions, and in non-irrigated and three irrigated groups (three variety registration periods) for Japanese rice accessions. We also developed web tools for finding polymorphic SNPs between any two rice accessions and for the primer design to develop cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers at any SNP.

However, Chinese health-care systems are challenged with its overwhelming numbers of patients, limited resources, and large regional disparities. Aim To improve quality of stroke care to address regional disparities through process improvement. Method and design The Shanghai Stroke Service System (4S) is established as a regional network for stroke care quality improvement in the Shanghai metropolitan area. The 4S registry uses a web-based database that automatically extracts data from structured electronic medical records. Site-specific education and training program will be designed and administrated according to their baseline characteristics. Both acute reperfusion therapies including thrombectomy and thrombolysis in the acute phase and subsequent care were measured and monitored with feedback. Primary outcome is to evaluate the differences in quality metrics between baseline characteristics (including rate of thrombolysis in acute stroke and key performance indicators in secondary prevention) and post-intervention. Conclusions The 4S system is a regional stroke network that monitors the ongoing stroke care quality in Shanghai. This project will provide the opportunity to evaluate the spectrum of acute stroke care and design quality improvement processes for better stroke care.

21333005,TRAM (Transcriptome Mapper): database-driven creation and analysis of transcriptome maps from multiple sources.,"<h4>Background</h4>Several tools have been developed to perform global gene expression profile data analysis, to search for specific chromosomal regions whose features meet defined criteria as well as to study neighbouring gene expression. However, most of these tools are tailored for a specific use in a particular context (e.g. they are species-specific, or limited to a particular data format) and they typically accept only gene lists as input.<h4>Results</h4>TRAM (Transcriptome Mapper) is a new general tool that allows the simple generation and analysis of quantitative transcriptome maps, starting from any source listing gene expression values for a given gene set (e.g. expression microarrays), implemented as a relational database. It includes a parser able to assign univocal and updated gene symbols to gene identifiers from different data sources. Moreover, TRAM is able to perform intra-sample and inter-sample data normalization, including an original variant of quantile normalization (scaled quantile), useful to normalize data from platforms with highly different numbers of investigated genes. When in 'Map' mode, the software generates a quantitative representation of the transcriptome of a sample (or of a pool of samples) and identifies if segments of defined lengths are over/under-expressed compared to the desired threshold. When in 'Cluster' mode, the software searches for a set of over/under-expressed consecutive genes. Statistical significance for all results is calculated with respect to genes localized on the same chromosome or to all genome genes. Transcriptome maps, showing differential expression between two sample groups, relative to two different biological conditions, may be easily generated. We present the results of a biological model test, based on a meta-analysis comparison between a sample pool of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and a sample pool of megakaryocytic cells. Biologically relevant chromosomal segments and gene clusters with differential expression during the differentiation toward megakaryocyte were identified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>TRAM is designed to create, and statistically analyze, quantitative transcriptome maps, based on gene expression data from multiple sources.

29297289,dBBQs: dataBase of Bacterial Quality scores.,"<h4>Background</h4>It is well-known that genome sequencing technologies are becoming significantly cheaper and faster. As a result of this, the exponential growth in sequencing data in public databases allows us to explore ever growing large collections of genome sequences. However, it is less known that the majority of available sequenced genome sequences in public databases are not complete, drafts of varying qualities. We have calculated quality scores for around 100,000 bacterial genomes from all major genome repositories and put them in a fast and easy-to-use database.<h4>Results</h4>Prokaryotic genomic data from all sources were collected and combined to make a non-redundant set of bacterial genomes. The genome quality score for each was calculated by four different measurements: assembly quality, number of rRNA and tRNA genes, and the occurrence of conserved functional domains. The dataBase of Bacterial Quality scores (dBBQs) was designed to store and retrieve quality scores. It offers fast searching and download features which the result can be used for further analysis. In addition, the search results are shown in interactive JavaScript chart framework using DC.js. The analysis of quality scores across major public genome databases find that around 68% of the genomes are of acceptable quality for many uses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>dBBQs (available at http://arc-gem.uams.edu/dbbqs ) provides genome quality scores for all available prokaryotic genome sequences with a user-friendly Web-interface. These scores can be used as cut-offs to get a high-quality set of genomes for testing bioinformatics tools or improving the analysis.

To facilitate data processing steps minding the gap between biologists and bioinformaticians, we developed CSI NGS Portal, an online platform which gathers established bioinformatics pipelines to provide fully automated NGS data analysis and sharing in a user-friendly website. The portal currently provides 16 standard pipelines for analysing data from DNA, RNA, smallRNA, ChIP, RIP, 4C, SHAPE, circRNA, eCLIP, Bisulfite and scRNA sequencing, and is flexible to expand with new pipelines. The users can upload raw data in FASTQ format and submit jobs in a few clicks, and the results will be self-accessible via the portal to view/download/share in real-time. The output can be readily used as the final report or as input for other tools depending on the pipeline. Overall, CSI NGS Portal helps researchers rapidly analyse their NGS data and share results with colleagues without the aid of a bioinformatician.

23921808,The CRAPome: a contaminant repository for affinity purification-mass spectrometry data.,"Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a widely used approach for the identification of protein-protein interactions. However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (for example, proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. The standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative-control purifications, but many small-scale AP-MS studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set when available controls are limited. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple AP-MS studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol. Here we present the contaminant repository for affinity purification (the CRAPome) and describe its use for scoring protein-protein interactions.

32427333,webPSN v2.0: a webserver to infer fingerprints of structural communication in biomacromolecules.,"A mixed Protein Structure Network (PSN) and Elastic Network Model-Normal Mode Analysis (ENM-NMA)-based strategy (i.e. PSN-ENM) was developed to investigate structural communication in bio-macromolecules. Protein Structure Graphs (PSGs) are computed on a single structure, whereas information on system dynamics is supplied by ENM-NMA. The approach was implemented in a webserver (webPSN), which was significantly updated herein. The webserver now handles both proteins and nucleic acids and relies on an internal upgradable database of network parameters for ions and small molecules in all PDB structures. Apart from the radical restyle of the server and some changes in the calculation setup, other major novelties concern the possibility to: a) compute the differences in nodes, links, and communication pathways between two structures (i.e. network difference) and b) infer links, hubs, communities, and metapaths from consensus networks computed on a number of structures. These new features are useful to identify commonalties and differences between two different functional states of the same system or structural-communication signatures in homologous or analogous systems. The output analysis relies on 3D-representations, interactive tables and graphs, also available for download. Speed and accuracy make this server suitable to comparatively investigate structural communication in large sets of bio-macromolecular systems.

22976082,An RNA Mapping DataBase for curating RNA structure mapping experiments.,"<h4>Summary</h4>We have established an RNA mapping database (RMDB) to enable structural, thermodynamic and kinetic comparisons across single-nucleotide-resolution RNA structure mapping experiments. The volume of structure mapping data has greatly increased since the development of high-throughput sequencing techniques, accelerated software pipelines and large-scale mutagenesis. For scientists wishing to infer relationships between RNA sequence/structure and these mapping data, there is a need for a database that is curated, tagged with error estimates and interfaced with tools for sharing, visualization, search and meta-analysis. Through its on-line front-end, the RMDB allows users to explore single-nucleotide-resolution mapping data in heat-map, bar-graph and colored secondary structure graphics; to leverage these data to generate secondary structure hypotheses; and to download the data in standardized and computer-friendly files, including the RDAT and community-consensus SNRNASM formats. At the time of writing, the database houses 53 entries, describing more than 2848 experiments of 1098 RNA constructs in several solution conditions and is growing rapidly.<h4>Availability</h4>Freely available on the web at http://rmdb.stanford.edu.<h4>Contact</h4>rhiju@stanford.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Online.",True,False,5.0,,rna mapping database,,17.915163200000002,ok,,mapping database,rmdb,v2,0.9151632,,True,False,False,,http://rmdb.stanford.edu,http://rmdb.stanford.edu,True,...4>Availability</h4>Freely available on the web at http://rmdb.stanford.edu.<h4>Contact</h4>rhiju@stanford.edu.<h4>Supplement...,1
22303335,MIRNA-DISTILLER: A Stand-Alone Application to Compile microRNA Data from Databases.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA molecules of ∼22 nucleotides which regulate large numbers of genes by binding to seed sequences at the 3'-untranslated region of target gene transcripts. The target mRNA is then usually degraded or translation is inhibited, although thus resulting in posttranscriptional down regulation of gene expression at the mRNA and/or protein level. Due to the bioinformatic difficulties in predicting functional miRNA binding sites, several publically available databases have been developed that predict miRNA binding sites based on different algorithms. The parallel use of different databases is currently indispensable, but highly uncomfortable and time consuming, especially when working with numerous genes of interest. We have therefore developed a new stand-alone program, termed MIRNA-DISTILLER, which allows to compile miRNA data for given target genes from public databases. Currently implemented are TargetScan, microCosm, and miRDB, which may be queried independently, pairwise, or together to calculate the respective intersections. Data are stored locally for application of further analysis tools including freely definable biological parameter filters, customized output-lists for both miRNAs and target genes, and various graphical facilities.

22871112,PKMiner: a database for exploring type II polyketide synthases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bacterial aromatic polyketides are a pharmacologically important group of natural products synthesized by type II polyketide synthases (type II PKSs) in actinobacteria. Isolation of novel aromatic polyketides from microbial sources is currently impeded because of the lack of knowledge about prolific taxa for polyketide synthesis and the difficulties in finding and optimizing target microorganisms. Comprehensive analysis of type II PKSs and the prediction of possible polyketide chemotypes in various actinobacterial genomes will thus enable the discovery or synthesis of novel polyketides in the most plausible microorganisms.<h4>Description</h4>We performed a comprehensive computational analysis of type II PKSs and their gene clusters in actinobacterial genomes. By identifying type II PKS subclasses from the sequence analysis of 280 known type II PKSs, we developed highly accurate domain classifiers for these subclasses and derived prediction rules for aromatic polyketide chemotypes generated by different combinations of type II PKS domains. Using 319 available actinobacterial genomes, we predicted 231 type II PKSs from 40 PKS gene clusters in 25 actinobacterial genomes, and polyketide chemotypes corresponding to 22 novel PKS gene clusters in 16 genomes. These results showed that the microorganisms capable of producing aromatic polyketides are specifically distributed within a certain suborder of Actinomycetales such as Catenulisporineae, Frankineae, Micrococcineae, Micromonosporineae, Pseudonocardineae, Streptomycineae, and Streptosporangineae.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We could identify the novel candidates of type II PKS gene clusters and their polyketide chemotypes in actinobacterial genomes by comprehensive analysis of type II PKSs and prediction of aromatic polyketides. The genome analysis results indicated that the specific suborders in actinomycetes could be used as prolific taxa for polyketide synthesis. The chemotype-prediction rules with the suggested type II PKS modules derived using this resource can be used further for microbial engineering to produce various aromatic polyketides. All these resources, together with the results of the analysis, are organized into an easy-to-use database PKMiner, which is accessible at the following URL: http://pks.kaist.ac.kr/pkminer.

31101000,Bioinformatics Resource Manager: a systems biology web tool for microRNA and omics data integration.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Bioinformatics Resource Manager (BRM) is a web-based tool developed to facilitate identifier conversion and data integration for Homo sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Macaca mulatta (macaque), as well as perform orthologous conversions among the supported species. In addition to providing a robust means of identifier conversion, BRM also incorporates a suite of microRNA (miRNA)-target databases upon which to query target genes or to perform reverse target lookups using gene identifiers.<h4>Results</h4>BRM has the capability to perform cross-species identifier lookups across common identifier types, directly integrate datasets across platform or species by performing identifier retrievals in the background, and retrieve miRNA targets from multiple databases simultaneously and integrate the resulting gene targets with experimental mRNA data. Here we use workflows provided in BRM to integrate RNA sequencing data across species to identify common biomarkers of exposure after treatment of human lung cells and zebrafish to benzo[a]pyrene (BAP). We further use the miRNA Target workflow to experimentally determine the role of miRNAs as regulators of BAP toxicity and identify the predicted functional consequences of miRNA-target regulation in our system. The output from BRM can easily and directly be uploaded to freely available visualization tools for further analysis. From these examples, we were able to identify an important role for several miRNAs as potential regulators of BAP toxicity in human lung cells associated with cell migration, cell communication, cell junction assembly and regulation of cell death.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, BRM provides bioinformatics tools to assist biologists having minimal programming skills with analysis and integration of high-content omics' data from various transcriptomic and proteomic platforms.

29028897,Sipros Ensemble improves database searching and filtering for complex metaproteomics.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Complex microbial communities can be characterized by metagenomics and metaproteomics. However, metagenome assemblies often generate enormous, and yet incomplete, protein databases, which undermines the identification of peptides and proteins in metaproteomics. This challenge calls for increased discrimination of true identifications from false identifications by database searching and filtering algorithms in metaproteomics.<h4>Results</h4>Sipros Ensemble was developed here for metaproteomics using an ensemble approach. Three diverse scoring functions from MyriMatch, Comet and the original Sipros were incorporated within a single database searching engine. Supervised classification with logistic regression was used to filter database searching results. Benchmarking with soil and marine microbial communities demonstrated a higher number of peptide and protein identifications by Sipros Ensemble than MyriMatch/Percolator, Comet/Percolator, MS-GF+/Percolator, Comet & MyriMatch/iProphet and Comet & MyriMatch & MS-GF+/iProphet.

33494129,Data resource profile: the allergic disease database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service.,"Researchers have been interested in probing how the environmental factors associated with allergic diseases affect the use of medical services. Considering this demand, we have constructed a database, named the Allergic Disease Database, based on the National Health Insurance Database (NHID). The NHID contains information on demographic and medical service utilization for approximately 99% of the Korean population. This study targeted 3 major allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. For the target diseases, our database provides daily medical service information, including the number of daily visits from 2013 and 2017, categorized by patients' characteristics such as address, sex, age, and duration of residence. We provide additional information, including yearly population, a number of patients, and averaged geocoding coordinates by eup, myeon, and dong district code (the smallest-scale administrative units in Korea). This information enables researchers to analyze how daily changes in the environmental factors of allergic diseases (e.g., particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and ozone) in certain regions would influence patients' behavioral patterns of medical service utilization. Moreover, researchers can analyze long-term trends in allergic diseases and the health effects caused by environmental factors such as daily climate and pollution data. The advantages of this database are easy access to data, additional levels of geographic detail, time-efficient data-refining and processing, and a de-identification process that minimizes the exposure of identifiable personal information.

27939290,The DisVis and PowerFit Web Servers: Explorative and Integrative Modeling of Biomolecular Complexes.,"Structure determination of complex molecular machines requires a combination of an increasing number of experimental methods with highly specialized software geared toward each data source to properly handle the gathered data. Recently, we introduced the two software packages PowerFit and DisVis. These combine high-resolution structures of atomic subunits with density maps from cryo-electron microscopy or distance restraints, typically acquired by chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry, respectively. Here, we report on recent advances in both GPGPU-accelerated software packages: PowerFit is a tool for rigid body fitting of atomic structures in cryo-electron density maps and has been updated to also output reliability indicators for the success of fitting, through the use of the Fisher z-transformation and associated confidence intervals; DisVis aims at quantifying the information content of distance restraints and identifying false-positive restraints. We extended its analysis capabilities to include an analysis of putative interface residues and to output an average shape representing the putative location of the ligand. To facilitate their use by a broad community, they have been implemented as web portals harvesting both local CPU resources and GPGPU-accelerated EGI grid resources.

30668675,The ReproGenomics Viewer: a multi-omics and cross-species resource compatible with single-cell studies for the reproductive science community.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Recent advances in transcriptomics have enabled unprecedented insight into gene expression analysis at a single-cell resolution. While it is anticipated that the number of publications based on such technologies will increase in the next decade, there is currently no public resource to centralize and enable scientists to explore single-cell datasets published in the field of reproductive biology.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a major update of the ReproGenomics Viewer, a cross-species and cross-technology web-based resource of manually-curated sequencing datasets related to reproduction. The redesign of the ReproGenomics Viewer's architecture is accompanied by significant growth of the database content including several landmark single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. The implementation of additional tools enables users to visualize and browse the complex, high-dimensional data now being generated in the reproductive field.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The ReproGenomics Viewer resource is freely accessible at http://rgv.genouest.org.

31805847,BEST: a web server for brain expression Spatio-temporal pattern analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Dysregulated gene expression patterns have been reported in several mental disorders. Limited by the difficulty of obtaining samples, psychiatric molecular mechanism research still relies heavily on clues from genetics studies. By using reference data from brain expression studies, multiple types of comprehensive gene expression pattern analysis have been performed on psychiatric genetic results. These systems-level spatial-temporal expression pattern analyses provided evidence on specific brain regions, developmental stages and molecular pathways that are possibly involved in psychiatric pathophysiology. At present, there is no online tool for such systematic analysis, which hinders the applications of analysis by non-informatics researchers such as experimental biologists and clinical molecular biologists.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the BEST web server to support Brain Expression Spatio-Temporal pattern analysis. There are three highlighted features of BEST: 1) visualization: it generates user-friendly visual results that are easy to interpret, including heatmaps, Venn diagrams, gene co-expression networks and cluster-based Manhattan gene plots; these results illustrate the complex spatio-temporal expression patterns, including expression quantification and correlation between genes; 2) integration: it provides comprehensive human brain spatio-temporal expression patterns by integrating data from currently available databases; 3) multi-dimensionality: it analyses input genes as both a whole set and several subsets (clusters) which are enriched according to co-expression patterns, and it also presents the correlation between genetic and expression data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To the best of our knowledge, BEST is the first data tool to support comprehensive human brain spatial-temporal expression pattern analysis. It helps to bridge disease-related genetic studies and mechanism studies, provides clues for key gene and molecular system identification, and supports the analysis of disease sensitive brain region and age stages.

27106060,PSI/TM-Coffee: a web server for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignments of regular and transmembrane proteins using homology extension on reduced databases.,"The PSI/TM-Coffee web server performs multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of proteins by combining homology extension with a consistency based alignment approach. Homology extension is performed with Position Specific Iterative (PSI) BLAST searches against a choice of redundant and non-redundant databases. The main novelty of this server is to allow databases of reduced complexity to rapidly perform homology extension. This server also gives the possibility to use transmembrane proteins (TMPs) reference databases to allow even faster homology extension on this important category of proteins. Aside from an MSA, the server also outputs topological prediction of TMPs using the HMMTOP algorithm. Previous benchmarking of the method has shown this approach outperforms the most accurate alignment methods such as MSAProbs, Kalign, PROMALS, MAFFT, ProbCons and PRALINE™.

30576482,NBDC RDF portal: a comprehensive repository for semantic data in life sciences.,"In the life sciences, researchers increasingly want to access multiple databases in an integrated way. However, different databases currently use different formats and vocabularies, hindering the proper integration of heterogeneous life science data. Adopting the Resource Description Framework (RDF) has the potential to address such issues by improving database interoperability, leading to advances in automatic data processing. Based on this idea, we have advised many Japanese database development groups to expose their databases in RDF. To further promote such activities, we have developed an RDF-based life science dataset repository called the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) RDF portal. All the datasets in this repository have been reviewed by the NBDC to ensure interoperability and queryability. As of July 2018, the service includes 21 RDF datasets, comprising over 45.5 billion triples. It provides SPARQL endpoints for all datasets, useful metadata and the ability to download RDF files.

21816034,The volatile compound BinBase mass spectral database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Volatile compounds comprise diverse chemical groups with wide-ranging sources and functions. These compounds originate from major pathways of secondary metabolism in many organisms and play essential roles in chemical ecology in both plant and animal kingdoms. In past decades, sampling methods and instrumentation for the analysis of complex volatile mixtures have improved; however, design and implementation of database tools to process and store the complex datasets have lagged behind.<h4>Description</h4>The volatile compound BinBase (vocBinBase) is an automated peak annotation and database system developed for the analysis of GC-TOF-MS data derived from complex volatile mixtures. The vocBinBase DB is an extension of the previously reported metabolite BinBase software developed to track and identify derivatized metabolites. The BinBase algorithm uses deconvoluted spectra and peak metadata (retention index, unique ion, spectral similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and peak purity) from the Leco ChromaTOF software, and annotates peaks using a multi-tiered filtering system with stringent thresholds. The vocBinBase algorithm assigns the identity of compounds existing in the database. Volatile compound assignments are supported by the Adams mass spectral-retention index library, which contains over 2,000 plant-derived volatile compounds. Novel molecules that are not found within vocBinBase are automatically added using strict mass spectral and experimental criteria. Users obtain fully annotated data sheets with quantitative information for all volatile compounds for studies that may consist of thousands of chromatograms. The vocBinBase database may also be queried across different studies, comprising currently 1,537 unique mass spectra generated from 1.7 million deconvoluted mass spectra of 3,435 samples (18 species). Mass spectra with retention indices and volatile profiles are available as free download under the CC-BY agreement (http://vocbinbase.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The BinBase database algorithms have been successfully modified to allow for tracking and identification of volatile compounds in complex mixtures. The database is capable of annotating large datasets (hundreds to thousands of samples) and is well-suited for between-study comparisons such as chemotaxonomy investigations. This novel volatile compound database tool is applicable to research fields spanning chemical ecology to human health.

29408954,ARGs-OAP v2.0 with an expanded SARG database and Hidden Markov Models for enhancement characterization and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental metagenomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Much global attention has been paid to antibiotic resistance in monitoring its emergence, accumulation and dissemination. For rapid characterization and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in metagenomic datasets, an online analysis pipeline, ARGs-OAP has been developed consisting of a database termed Structured Antibiotic Resistance Genes (the SARG) with a hierarchical structure (ARGs type-subtype-reference sequence).<h4>Results</h4>The new release of the database, termed SARG version 2.0, contains sequences not only from CARD and ARDB databases, but also carefully selected and curated sequences from the latest protein collection of the NCBI-NR database, to keep up to date with the increasing number of ARG deposited sequences. SARG v2.0 has tripled the sequences of the first version and demonstrated improved coverage of ARGs detection in metagenomes from various environmental samples. In addition to annotation of high-throughput raw reads using a similarity search strategy, ARGs-OAP v2.0 now provides model-based identification of assembled sequences using SARGfam, a high-quality profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM), containing profiles of ARG subtypes. Additionally, ARGs-OAP v2.0 improves cell number quantification by using the average coverage of essential single copy marker genes, as an option in addition to the previous method based on the 16S rRNA gene.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>ARGs-OAP can be accessed through http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs.

25886721,EGFR Mutant Structural Database: computationally predicted 3D structures and the corresponding binding free energies with gefitinib and erlotinib.,"<h4>Background</h4>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-induced drug resistance has caused great difficulties in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, structural information is available for just a few EGFR mutants. In this study, we created an EGFR Mutant Structural Database (freely available at http://bcc.ee.cityu.edu.hk/data/EGFR.html ), including the 3D EGFR mutant structures and their corresponding binding free energies with two commonly used inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib).<h4>Results</h4>We collected the information of 942 NSCLC patients belonging to 112 mutation types. These mutation types are divided into five groups (insertion, deletion, duplication, modification and substitution), and substitution accounts for 61.61% of the mutation types and 54.14% of all the patients. Among all the 942 patients, 388 cases experienced a mutation at residue site 858 with leucine replaced by arginine (L858R), making it the most common mutation type. Moreover, 36 (32.14%) mutation types occur at exon 19, and 419 (44.48%) patients carried a mutation at exon 21. In this study, we predicted the EGFR mutant structures using Rosetta with the collected mutation types. In addition, Amber was employed to refine the structures followed by calculating the binding free energies of mutant-drug complexes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The EGFR Mutant Structural Database provides resources of 3D structures and the binding affinity with inhibitors, which can be used by other researchers to study NSCLC further and by medical doctors as reference for NSCLC treatment.",True,False,4.0,,structural database,,17.66345924,ok,,,egfr,v2,0.66345924,EGFR Mutant Structural Database,True,False,False,,http://bcc.ee.cityu.edu.hk/data/EGFR.html,http://bcc.ee.cityu.edu.hk/data/EGFR.html,True,"...R Mutant Structural Database (freely available at http://bcc.ee.cityu.edu.hk/data/EGFR.html ), including the 3D EGFR mutant structures and th...",1
27153579,ARGs-OAP: online analysis pipeline for antibiotic resistance genes detection from metagenomic data using an integrated structured ARG-database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has become an increasing concern for public health. Metagenomics approaches can effectively detect broad profiles of ARGs in environmental samples; however, the detection and subsequent classification of ARG-like sequences are time consuming and have been severe obstacles in employing metagenomic methods. We sought to accelerate quantification of ARGs in metagenomic data from environmental samples.<h4>Results</h4>A Structured ARG reference database (SARG) was constructed by integrating ARDB and CARD, the two most commonly used databases. SARG was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query sequence identification by similarity. A database with a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence) was then constructed to facilitate classification (assigning ARG-like sequence to type, subtype and reference sequence) of sequences identified through similarity search. Utilizing SARG and a previously proposed hybrid functional gene annotation pipeline, we developed an online pipeline called ARGs-OAP for fast annotation and classification of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data. We also evaluated and proposed a set of criteria important for efficiently conducting metagenomic analysis of ARGs using ARGs-OAP.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Perl script for ARGs-OAP can be downloaded from https://github.com/biofuture/Ublastx_stageone ARGs-OAP can be accessed through http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs<h4>Contact</h4>zhangt@hku.hk or tiedjej@msu.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,,oap,17.6534428,ok,,args-oap | structured arg reference database,card | sarg,v2,0.6534428,ARGs-OAP,True,False,False,,http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs,http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs,True,...Ublastx_stageone ARGs-OAP can be accessed through http://smile.hku.hk/SARGs<h4>Contact</h4>zhangt@hku.hk or tiedjej@msu.edu<h...,1

24098075,The Nanomaterial Registry: facilitating the sharing and analysis of data in the diverse nanomaterial community.,"The amount of data being generated in the nanotechnology research space is significant, and the coordination, sharing, and downstream analysis of the data is complex and consistently deliberated. The complexities of the data are due in large part to the inherently complicated characteristics of nanomaterials. Also, testing protocols and assays used for nanomaterials are diverse and lacking standardization. The Nanomaterial Registry has been developed to address such challenges as the need for standard methods, data formatting, and controlled vocabularies for data sharing. The Registry is an authoritative, web-based tool whose purpose is to simplify the community's level of effort in assessing nanomaterial data from environmental and biological interaction studies. Because the Registry is meant to be an authoritative resource, all data-driven content is systematically archived and reviewed by subject-matter experts. To support and advance nanomaterial research, a set of minimal information about nanomaterials (MIAN) has been developed and is foundational to the Registry data model. The MIAN has been used to create evaluation and similarity criteria for nanomaterials that are curated into the Registry. The Registry is a publicly available resource that is being built through collaborations with many stakeholder groups in the nanotechnology community, including industry, regulatory, government, and academia. Features of the Registry website (http://www.nanomaterialregistry.org) currently include search, browse, side-by-side comparison of nanomaterials, compliance ratings based on the quality and quantity of data, and the ability to search for similar nanomaterials within the Registry.

33784300,Orchestrating privacy-protected big data analyses of data from different resources with R and DataSHIELD.,"Combined analysis of multiple, large datasets is a common objective in the health- and biosciences. Existing methods tend to require researchers to physically bring data together in one place or follow an analysis plan and share results. Developed over the last 10 years, the DataSHIELD platform is a collection of R packages that reduce the challenges of these methods. These include ethico-legal constraints which limit researchers' ability to physically bring data together and the analytical inflexibility associated with conventional approaches to sharing results. The key feature of DataSHIELD is that data from research studies stay on a server at each of the institutions that are responsible for the data. Each institution has control over who can access their data. The platform allows an analyst to pass commands to each server and the analyst receives results that do not disclose the individual-level data of any study participants. DataSHIELD uses Opal which is a data integration system used by epidemiological studies and developed by the OBiBa open source project in the domain of bioinformatics. However, until now the analysis of big data with DataSHIELD has been limited by the storage formats available in Opal and the analysis capabilities available in the DataSHIELD R packages. We present a new architecture (""resources"") for DataSHIELD and Opal to allow large, complex datasets to be used at their original location, in their original format and with external computing facilities. We provide some real big data analysis examples in genomics and geospatial projects. For genomic data analyses, we also illustrate how to extend the resources concept to address specific big data infrastructures such as GA4GH or EGA, and make use of shell commands.

29040459,UC2 search: using unique connectivity of uncharged compounds for metabolite annotation by database searching in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics.,"<h4>Summary</h4>For metabolite annotation in metabolomics, variations in the registered states of compounds (charged molecules and multiple components, such as salts) and their redundancy among compound databases could be the cause of misannotations and hamper immediate recognition of the uniqueness of metabolites while searching by mass values measured using mass spectrometry. We developed a search system named UC2 (Unique Connectivity of Uncharged Compounds), where compounds are tentatively neutralized into uncharged states and stored on the basis of their unique connectivity of atoms after removing their stereochemical information using the first block in the hash of the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier, by which false-positive hits are remarkably reduced, both charged and uncharged compounds are properly searched in a single query and records having a unique connectivity are compiled in a single search result.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The UC2 search tool is available free of charge as a REST web service (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher) and a Java-based GUI tool.<h4>Contact</h4>sakurai@kazusa.or.jp.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,6.0,,,uc2,17.61514455,ok,,nique connectivity of uncharged compounds,,v2,0.61514455,UC2 search,True,False,False,,http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher,http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher,True,...s available free of charge as a REST web service (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher) and a Java-based GUI tool.<h4>Contact</h4>sakura...,1
27328919,TP53 Variations in Human Cancers: New Lessons from the IARC TP53 Database and Genomics Data.,"TP53 gene mutations are one of the most frequent somatic events in cancer. The IARC TP53 Database (http://p53.iarc.fr) is a popular resource that compiles occurrence and phenotype data on TP53 germline and somatic variations linked to human cancer. The deluge of data coming from cancer genomic studies generates new data on TP53 variations and attracts a growing number of database users for the interpretation of TP53 variants. Here, we present the current contents and functionalities of the IARC TP53 Database and perform a systematic analysis of TP53 somatic mutation data extracted from this database and from genomic data repositories. This analysis showed that IARC has more TP53 somatic mutation data than genomic repositories (29,000 vs. 4,000). However, the more complete screening achieved by genomic studies highlighted some overlooked facts about TP53 mutations, such as the presence of a significant number of mutations occurring outside the DNA-binding domain in specific cancer types. We also provide an update on TP53 inherited variants including the ones that should be considered as neutral frequent variations. We thus provide an update of current knowledge on TP53 variations in human cancer as well as inform users on the efficient use of the IARC TP53 Database.",True,False,4.0,,,iarc,17.561161759999997,ok,,,,v2,0.56116176,TP53 Variations in Human Cancers,True,False,False,,http://p53.iarc.fr,http://p53.iarc.fr,True,...somatic events in cancer.

22529179,"Towards semi-automated curation: using text mining to recreate the HIV-1, human protein interaction database.","Manual curation has long been used for extracting key information found within the primary literature for input into biological databases. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human protein interaction database (HHPID), for example, contains 2589 manually extracted interactions, linked to 14,312 mentions in 3090 articles. The advancement of text-mining (TM) techniques has offered a possibility to rapidly retrieve such data from large volumes of text to a high degree of accuracy. Here, we present a recreation of the HHPID using the current state of the art in TM. To retrieve interactions, we performed gene/protein named entity recognition (NER) and applied two molecular event extraction tools on all abstracts and titles cited in the HHPID. Our best NER scores for precision, recall and F-score were 87.5%, 90.0% and 88.6%, respectively, while event extraction achieved 76.4%, 84.2% and 80.1%, respectively. We demonstrate that over 50% of the HHPID interactions can be recreated from abstracts and titles. Furthermore, from 49 available open-access full-text articles, we extracted a total of 237 unique HIV-1-human interactions, as opposed to 187 interactions recorded in the HHPID from the same articles. On average, we extracted 23 times more mentions of interactions and events from a full-text article than from an abstract and title, with a 6-fold increase in the number of unique interactions. We further demonstrated that more frequently occurring interactions extracted by TM are more likely to be true positives. Overall, the results demonstrate that TM was able to recover a large proportion of interactions, many of which were found within the HHPID, making TM a useful assistant in the manual curation process. Finally, we also retrieved other types of interactions in the context of HIV-1 that are not currently present in the HHPID, thus, expanding the scope of this data set.

The biochemical background of the disease is poorly understood, which motivated us to perform RNA-Seq experiment, aimed at better characterizing the KTCN transcriptome and identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that might be involved in KTCN etiology. The in silico functional studies based on predicted lncRNA:RNA base-pairings led us to recognition of a number of lncRNAs possibly regulating genes with known or plausible links to KTCN.

27301453,ProInflam: a webserver for the prediction of proinflammatory antigenicity of peptides and proteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>Proinflammatory immune response involves a complex series of molecular events leading to inflammatory reaction at a site, which enables host to combat plurality of infectious agents. It can be initiated by specific stimuli such as viral, bacterial, parasitic or allergenic antigens, or by non-specific stimuli such as LPS. On counter with such antigens, the complex interaction of antigen presenting cells, T cells and inflammatory mediators like IL1α, IL1β, TNFα, IL12, IL18 and IL23 lead to proinflammatory immune response and further clearance of infection. In this study, we have tried to establish a relation between amino acid sequence of antigen and induction of proinflammatory response.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 729 experimentally-validated proinflammatory and 171 non-proinflammatory epitopes were obtained from IEDB database. The A, F, I, L and V amino acids and AF, FA, FF, PF, IV, IN dipeptides were observed as preferred residues in proinflammatory epitopes. Using the compositional and motif-based features of proinflammatory and non-proinflammatory epitopes, we have developed machine learning-based models for prediction of proinflammatory response of peptides. The hybrid of motifs and dipeptide-based features displayed best performance with MCC = 0.58 and an accuracy of 87.6 %.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The amino acid sequence-based features of peptides were used to develop a machine learning-based prediction tool for the prediction of proinflammatory epitopes. This is a unique tool for the computational identification of proinflammatory peptide antigen/candidates and provides leads for experimental validations.

24682735,The eGenVar data management system--cataloguing and sharing sensitive data and metadata for the life sciences.,"Systematic data management and controlled data sharing aim at increasing reproducibility, reducing redundancy in work, and providing a way to efficiently locate complementing or contradicting information. One method of achieving this is collecting data in a central repository or in a location that is part of a federated system and providing interfaces to the data. However, certain data, such as data from biobanks or clinical studies, may, for legal and privacy reasons, often not be stored in public repositories. Instead, we describe a metadata cataloguing system and a software suite for reporting the presence of data from the life sciences domain. The system stores three types of metadata: file information, file provenance and data lineage, and content descriptions. Our software suite includes both graphical and command line interfaces that allow users to report and tag files with these different metadata types. Importantly, the files remain in their original locations with their existing access-control mechanisms in place, while our system provides descriptions of their contents and relationships. Our system and software suite thereby provide a common framework for cataloguing and sharing both public and private data.

The server combines information from the most popular orthology-prediction resources, including four tools and four online databases. Functional annotation utilizes five additional comparisons between the query and identified homologs, including: sequence similarity, protein domain architectures, functional motifs, Gene Ontology term assignments and a list of associated articles. Furthermore, the server uses a plurality-based rating system to evaluate the orthology relationships and to rank the reference proteins by their evolutionary and functional relevance to the query. Using a dataset of ∼1 million true yeast orthologs as a sample reference set, we show that combining multiple orthology-prediction tools in ORCAN increases the sensitivity and precision by 1-2 percent points.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The service is available for free at http://www.combio.pl/orcan/ .<h4>Contact</h4>wmk@amu.edu.pl.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,,orcan,16.99740314,ok,,orcan-a,rcan,v2,0.99740314,,True,False,False,,http://www.combio.pl/orcan/,http://www.combio.pl/orcan/,True,...entation</h4>The service is available for free at http://www.combio.pl/orcan/ .<h4>Contact</h4>wmk@amu.edu.pl.<h4>Supplementary...,1

An objective process to identify critical gaps in knowledge and available control tools should aid the prioritisation of research in order to speed up the development of new or improved diagnostics, vaccines and pharmaceuticals and reduce the burden of animal diseases.<h4>Method</h4>Here, we describe the construction of a database based on expert consultation for 52 infectious diseases of animals.<h4>Results</h4>For each disease, an expert group produced a disease and product analysis document that formed the basis for gap analysis and prioritisation. The prioritisation model was based on a closed scoring system, employing identical weights for six evaluation criteria (disease knowledge; impact on animal health and welfare; impact on public health; impact on wider society; impact on trade; control tools). The diseases were classified into three groups: epizootic diseases, food-producing animal complexes or zoonotic diseases.<h4>Discussion</h4>The highly ranked diseases in the prioritisation model comprised mostly zoonotic and epizootic diseases with important gaps identified in vaccine development and pharmaceuticals, respectively. The most important outcome is the identification of key research needs by disease. The rankings and research needs by disease are provided on a public website ( www.discontools.eu ) which is currently being updated based on new expert consultations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As such, it can become a reference point for funders of research including the European Commission, member states, foundations, trusts along with private industry to prioritise research.

This makes them potential candidates as probes of cellular interactions, notably protein-biomolecule interactions. However, the empirical conversion of the amino acids that constitute a peptide from L-forms to D-forms will result in abrogation of the normal interactions made by the L-amino acids due to side-chain orientation changes that are associated with the changes in chirality.

26870952,Muscle Logic: New Knowledge Resource for Anatomy Enables Comprehensive Searches of the Literature on the Feeding Muscles of Mammals.,"<h4>Background</h4>In recent years large bibliographic databases have made much of the published literature of biology available for searches. However, the capabilities of the search engines integrated into these databases for text-based bibliographic searches are limited. To enable searches that deliver the results expected by comparative anatomists, an underlying logical structure known as an ontology is required.<h4>Development and testing of the ontology</h4>Here we present the Mammalian Feeding Muscle Ontology (MFMO), a multi-species ontology focused on anatomical structures that participate in feeding and other oral/pharyngeal behaviors. A unique feature of the MFMO is that a simple, computable, definition of each muscle, which includes its attachments and innervation, is true across mammals. This construction mirrors the logical foundation of comparative anatomy and permits searches using language familiar to biologists. Further, it provides a template for muscles that will be useful in extending any anatomy ontology. The MFMO is developed to support the Feeding Experiments End-User Database Project (FEED, https://feedexp.org/), a publicly-available, online repository for physiological data collected from in vivo studies of feeding (e.g., mastication, biting, swallowing) in mammals. Currently the MFMO is integrated into FEED and also into two literature-specific implementations of Textpresso, a text-mining system that facilitates powerful searches of a corpus of scientific publications. We evaluate the MFMO by asking questions that test the ability of the ontology to return appropriate answers (competency questions). We compare the results of queries of the MFMO to results from similar searches in PubMed and Google Scholar.<h4>Results and significance</h4>Our tests demonstrate that the MFMO is competent to answer queries formed in the common language of comparative anatomy, but PubMed and Google Scholar are not. Overall, our results show that by incorporating anatomical ontologies into searches, an expanded and anatomically comprehensive set of results can be obtained.

This article reports a new web server, Super, dedicated to the task of rapidly screening the protein data bank (PDB) to identify all fragments that superpose with a query under a prespecified threshold of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). Super relies on efficiently computing a mathematical bound on the commonly used structural similarity measure, RMSD of superposition. This allows the server to filter out a large proportion of fragments that are unrelated to the query; >99% of the total number of fragments in some cases. For a typical query, Super scans the current PDB containing over 80,500 structures (with ∼40 million potential oligopeptide fragments to match) in under a minute.

22328782,Spliceman--a computational web server that predicts sequence variations in pre-mRNA splicing.,"<h4>Summary</h4>It was previously demonstrated that splicing elements are positional dependent. We exploited this relationship between location and function by comparing positional distributions between all possible 4096 hexamers around a database of human splice sites. The distance measure used in this study found point mutations that produced higher distances disrupted splicing, whereas point mutations with smaller distances generally had no effect on splicing. Reasoning the idea that functional splicing elements have signature positional distributions around constitutively spliced exons, we introduce Spliceman-an online tool that predicts how likely distant mutations around annotated splice sites were to disrupt splicing. Spliceman takes a set of DNA sequences with point mutations and returns a ranked list to predict the effects of point mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. The current implementation included the analyses of 11 genomes: human, chimp, rhesus, mouse, rat, dog, cat, chicken, guinea pig, frog and zebrafish.<h4>Availability</h4>Freely available on the web at http://fairbrother.biomed.brown.edu/spliceman/<h4>Contact</h4>fairbrother@brown.edu.",True,False,6.0,,spliceman,,16.9941254,ok,,a database of human | spliceman--a | spliceman-a,,v2,0.9941254,,True,False,False,,http://fairbrother.biomed.brown.edu/spliceman/,http://fairbrother.biomed.brown.edu/spliceman/,True,...4>Availability</h4>Freely available on the web at http://fairbrother.biomed.brown.edu/spliceman/<h4>Contact</h4>fairbrother@brown.edu.,1
32854096,SmoCuDa: A Validated Smoking Cue Database to Reliably Induce Craving in Tobacco Use Disorder.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cue-reactivity paradigms provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of nicotine craving in nicotine-dependent subjects. In order to study cue-driven nicotine craving, robust and validated stimulus datasets are essential.<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim of this study was to generate and validate a large set of individually rated smoking-related cues that allow for assessment of different stimulus intensities along the dimensions craving, valence, and arousal.<h4>Methods</h4>The image database consisted of 330 visual cues. Two hundred fifty smoking-associated pictures (Creative Commons license) were chosen from online databases and showed a widespread variety of smoking-associated content. Eighty pictures from previously published databases were included for cross-validation. Forty volunteers with tobacco use disorder rated ""urge-to-smoke,"" ""valence,"" and ""arousal"" for all images on a 100-point visual analogue scale. Pictures were also labelled according to 18 categories such as lit/unlit cigarettes in mouth, cigarette end, and cigarette in ashtray.<h4>Results</h4>Ratings (mean ± SD) were as follows: urge to smoke, 44.9 ± 13.2; valence, 51.2 ± 7.6; and arousal, 54.6 ± 7.1. All ratings, particularly ""urge to smoke,"" were widely distributed along the whole scale spectrum.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We present a novel image library of well-described smoking-related cues, which were rated on a continuous scale along the dimensions craving, valence, and arousal that accounts for inter-individual differences.

27105845,Companion: a web server for annotation and analysis of parasite genomes.,"Currently available sequencing technologies enable quick and economical sequencing of many new eukaryotic parasite (apicomplexan or kinetoplastid) species or strains. Compared to SNP calling approaches, de novo assembly of these genomes enables researchers to additionally determine insertion, deletion and recombination events as well as to detect complex sequence diversity, such as that seen in variable multigene families. However, there currently are no automated eukaryotic annotation pipelines offering the required range of results to facilitate such analyses. A suitable pipeline needs to perform evidence-supported gene finding as well as functional annotation and pseudogene detection up to the generation of output ready to be submitted to a public database. Moreover, no current tool includes quick yet informative comparative analyses and a first pass visualization of both annotation and analysis results. To overcome those needs we have developed the Companion web server (http://companion.sanger.ac.uk) providing parasite genome annotation as a service using a reference-based approach.

30274705,"DynBench3D, a Web-Resource to Dynamically Generate Benchmark Sets of Large Heteromeric Protein Complexes.","Multi-protein machines are responsible for most cellular tasks, and many efforts have been invested in the systematic identification and characterization of thousands of these macromolecular assemblies. However, unfortunately, the (quasi) atomic details necessary to understand their function are available only for a tiny fraction of the known complexes. The computational biology community is developing strategies to integrate structural data of different nature, from electron microscopy to X-ray crystallography, to model large molecular machines, as it has been done for individual proteins and interactions with remarkable success. However, unlike for binary interactions, there is no reliable gold-standard set of three-dimensional (3D) complexes to benchmark the performance of these methodologies and detect their limitations. Here, we present a strategy to dynamically generate non-redundant sets of 3D heteromeric complexes with three or more components. By changing the values of sequence identity and component overlap between assemblies required to define complex redundancy, we can create sets of representative complexes with known 3D structure (i.e., target complexes). Using an identity threshold of 20% and imposing a fraction of component overlap of <0.5, we identify 495 unique target complexes, which represent a real non-redundant set of heteromeric assemblies with known 3D structure. Moreover, for each target complex, we also identify a set of assemblies, of varying degrees of identity and component overlap, that can be readily used as input in a complex modeling exercise (i.e., template subcomplexes). We hope that resources like this will significantly help the development and progress assessment of novel methodologies, as docking benchmarks and blind prediction contests did.

MD trajectories are obtained after months of calculations, analysed in situ, and in practice forgotten. Several projects to generate stable trajectory databases have been developed for proteins, but no equivalence exists in the nucleic acids world. We present here a novel database system to store MD trajectories and analyses of nucleic acids.

Because of the inherent heterogeneity of tumors, these small molecules are often administered in combination to prevent emergence of resistant cell subpopulations. Therefore, new combination strategies to overcome drug resistance in patients with advanced cancer are needed. In this study, we performed a systematic evaluation of the therapeutic activity of over 5,000 pairs of FDA-approved cancer drugs against a panel of 60 well-characterized human tumor cell lines (NCI-60) to uncover combinations with greater than additive growth-inhibitory activity. Screening results were compiled into a database, termed the NCI-ALMANAC (A Large Matrix of Anti-Neoplastic Agent Combinations), publicly available at https://dtp.cancer.gov/ncialmanac Subsequent <i>in vivo</i> experiments in mouse xenograft models of human cancer confirmed combinations with greater than single-agent efficacy. Concomitant detection of mechanistic biomarkers for these combinations <i>in vivo</i> supported the initiation of two phase I clinical trials at the NCI to evaluate clofarabine with bortezomib and nilotinib with paclitaxel in patients with advanced cancer.

Its deficiency leads to neurological disorders such as ataxia, paralysis, learning disability, mental retardation, and memory loss. However, the glycoproteins that are responsible for these diseases are not well characterized. In this study, Drosophila melanogaster was used as a model organism to identify the N-glycosylated proteins and N-glycosylation sites of its CNS by means of proteomics. Adult fly heads were digested with chymotrypsin or trypsin and the N-linked glycopeptides were captured using solid phase extraction of N-linked glycopeptides (SPEG) technique followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis using LTQ OrbiTrap Velos. Three hundred and thirty new and 147 previously known glycoproteins were identified from 721 uniquely detected peptides that have 740 NXS/T glycosylation sites. The N-glycosylation sites were highly abundant in cell adhesion, ion channel, and ion binding molecules, which are important for nerve maturation, organ development, axon guidance, learning, and memory. Identification of the N-glycosylated sites of these proteins will enhance our knowledge of these proteins and serve as a basis for future studies to address the roles of these proteins in neurological function and disorders.

M. abscessus has emerged as a growing threat to patients with cystic fibrosis, where it causes accelerated inflammatory lung damage, is difficult and sometimes impossible to treat and can prevent safe transplantation. There is therefore an urgent unmet need to develop new therapeutic strategies. The elucidation of the M. abscessus genome in 2009 opened a wide range of research possibilities in the field of drug discovery that can be more effectively exploited upon the characterization of the structural proteome. Where there are no experimental structures, we have used the available amino acid sequences to create 3D models of the majority of the remaining proteins that constitute the M. abscessus proteome (3394 proteins and over 13 000 models) using a range of up-to-date computational tools, many developed by our own group. The models are freely available for download in an on-line database, together with quality data and functional annotation. Furthermore, we have developed an intuitive and user-friendly web interface (http://www.mabellinidb.science) that enables easy browsing, querying and retrieval of the proteins of interest.

Effects of stressors in this species are commonly determined at the population level using reproduction and survival as endpoints. The assessment of transcriptomic responses can be very useful e.g. to understand underlying mechanisms of toxicity with gene expression fingerprinting. In the present paper the following is being addressed: 1) development of suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries enriched for differentially expressed genes after metal and pesticide exposures; 2) sequencing and characterization of all generated cDNA inserts; 3) development of a publicly available genomic database on E. albidus.

34252246,Exploring Curated Conformational Ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in the Protein Ensemble Database.,"The Protein Ensemble Database (PED; https://proteinensemble.org/) is the major repository of conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Conformational ensembles of IDPs are primarily provided by their authors or occasionally collected from literature, and are subsequently deposited in PED along with the corresponding structured, manually curated metadata. The modeling of conformational ensembles usually relies on experimental data from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, or a combination of these techniques. The growing number of scientific studies based on these data, along with the astounding and swift progress in the field of protein intrinsic disorder, has required a significant update and upgrade of PED, first published in 2014. To this end, the database was entirely renewed in 2020 and now has a dedicated team of biocurators providing manually curated descriptions of the methods and conditions applied to generate the conformational ensembles and for checking consistency of the data. Here, we present a detailed description on how to explore PED with its protein pages and experimental pages, and how to interpret entries of conformational ensembles.

32493955,WilsonGen a comprehensive clinically annotated genomic variant resource for Wilson's Disease.,"Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases with an estimated global carrier frequency of 1 in 90 and a prevalence of 1 in 30,000. The disease owes its genesis to Kinnier Wilson who described the disease, and is caused by accumulation of Copper (Cu) in various organs including the liver, central nervous system, cornea, kidney, joints and cardiac muscle which contribute to the characteristic clinical features of WD. A number of studies have reported genetic variants in the ATP7B gene from diverse ethnic and geographical origins. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches has also enabled the discovery of a large number of novel variants in the gene associated with the disease. Previous attempts have been made to compile the knowledgebase and spectrum of genetic variants from across the multitude of publications, but have been limited by the utility due to the significant differences in approaches used to qualify pathogenicity of variants in each of the publications. The recent formulation of guidelines and algorithms for assessment of the pathogenicity of variants jointly put forward by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathologists (ACMG &AMP) has provided a framework for evidence based and systematic assessment of pathogenicity of variants. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive resource of genetic variants in ATP7B gene manually curated from literature and data resources and systematically annotated using the ACMG & AMP guidelines for assessing pathogenicity. The resource therefore serves as a central point for clinicians and geneticists working on WD and to the best of our knowledge is the most comprehensive and only clinically annotated resource for WD. The resource is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/WilsonGen/. We compiled a total of 3662 genetic variants from publications and databases associated with WD.

22843985,TMBB-DB: a transmembrane β-barrel proteome database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>We previously reported the development of a highly accurate statistical algorithm for identifying β-barrel outer membrane proteins or transmembrane β-barrels (TMBBs), from genomic sequence data of Gram-negative bacteria (Freeman,T.C. and Wimley,W.C. (2010) Bioinformatics, 26, 1965-1974). We have now applied this identification algorithm to all available Gram-negative bacterial genomes (over 600 chromosomes) and have constructed a publicly available, searchable, up-to-date, database of all proteins in these genomes.<h4>Results</h4>For each protein in the database, there is information on (i) β-barrel membrane protein probability for identification of β-barrels, (ii) β-strand and β-hairpin propensity for structure and topology prediction, (iii) signal sequence score because most TMBBs are secreted through the inner membrane translocon and, thus, have a signal sequence, and (iv) transmembrane α-helix predictions, for reducing false positive predictions. This information is sufficient for the accurate identification of most β-barrel membrane proteins in these genomes. In the database there are nearly 50 000 predicted TMBBs (out of 1.9 million total putative proteins). Of those, more than 15 000 are 'hypothetical' or 'putative' proteins, not previously identified as TMBBs. This wealth of genomic information is not available anywhere else.<h4>Availability</h4>The TMBB genomic database is available at http://beta-barrel.tulane.edu/.<h4>Contact</h4>wwimley@tulane.edu.",True,False,3.0,,,tmbb,16.9710249,ok,,,tmbb-db,v2,0.9710249,TMBB-DB,True,False,False,,http://beta-barrel.tulane.edu/,http://beta-barrel.tulane.edu/,True,...ity</h4>The TMBB genomic database is available at http://beta-barrel.tulane.edu/.<h4>Contact</h4>wwimley@tulane.edu.,1

In 2009, genetic data from 57 publications were collected in the arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) Genetic Variants Database (freeware available at http://www.arvcdatabase.info), which comprised 481 variants in eight ACM-associated genes. In recent years, deep genetic sequencing has increased our knowledge of the genetics of ACM, revealing a large spectrum of nucleotide variations for which pathogenicity needs to be assessed. As of April 20, 2014, we have updated the ARVD/C database into the ARVD/C database to contain more than 1,400 variants in 12 ACM-related genes (PKP2, DSP, DSC2, DSG2, JUP, TGFB3, TMEM43, LMNA, DES, TTN, PLN, CTNNA3) as reported in more than 160 references. Of these, only 411 nucleotide variants have been reported as pathogenic, whereas the significance of the other approximately 1,000 variants is still unknown.

The identification of named biological entities in text is a central and difficult task. We have developed an efficient algorithm and implementation of a dictionary-based approach to named entity recognition, which we here use to identify names of species and other taxa in text. The tool, SPECIES, is more than an order of magnitude faster and as accurate as existing tools. The precision and recall was assessed both on an existing gold-standard corpus and on a new corpus of 800 abstracts, which were manually annotated after the development of the tool. The corpus comprises abstracts from journals selected to represent many taxonomic groups, which gives insights into which types of organism names are hard to detect and which are easy. Finally, we have tagged organism names in the entire Medline database and developed a web resource, ORGANISMS, that makes the results accessible to the broad community of biologists.

29718096,GapRepairer: a server to model a structural gap and validate it using topological analysis.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Over 25% of protein structures possess unresolved fragments. On the other hand, approximately 6% of protein chains have non-trivial topology (and form knots, slipknots, lassos and links). As the topology is fundamental for the proper function of proteins, modeling of topologically correct structures is decisive in various fields, including biophysics, biotechnology and molecular biology. However, none of the currently existing tools take into account the topology of the model and those which could be modified to include topology, demand experience in bioinformatics, protein topology and knot theory.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we present the GapRepairer-the server that fills the gap in the spectrum of structure modeling methods. Its easy and intuitive interface offers the power of Modeller homology modeling to many non-experts in the field. This server determines the topology of templates and predicted structures. Such information when possible is used by the server to suggest the best model, or it can be used by the user to score models or to design artificially (dis)entangled structures.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>GapRepairer server along with tutorials, usage notes, movies and the database of already repaired structures is available at http://gaprepairer.cent.uw.edu.pl.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,6.0,,gaprepairer,,16.9591156,ok,,gaprepairer-t | aprepairer,,v2,0.9591156,GapRepairer,True,True,True,,http://gaprepairer.cent.uw.edu.pl,http://gaprepairer.cent.uw.edu.pl,True,...se of already repaired structures is available at http://gaprepairer.cent.uw.edu.pl.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
32293014,Prot2HG: a database of protein domains mapped to the human genome.,"Genetic variation occurring within conserved functional protein domains warrants special attention when examining DNA variation in the context of disease causation. Here we introduce a resource, freely available at www.prot2hg.com, that addresses the question of whether a particular variant falls onto an annotated protein domain and directly translates chromosomal coordinates onto protein residues. The tool can perform a multiple-site query in a simple way, and the whole dataset is available for download as well as incorporated into our own accessible pipeline. To create this resource, National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data were retrieved using the Entrez Programming Utilities. After processing all human protein domains, residue positions were reverse translated and mapped to the reference genome hg19 and stored in a MySQL database. In total, 760 487 protein domains from 42 371 protein models were mapped to hg19 coordinates and made publicly available for search or download (www.prot2hg.com). In addition, this annotation was implemented into the genomics research platform GENESIS in order to query nearly 8000 exomes and genomes of families with rare Mendelian disorders (tgp-foundation.org). When applied to patient genetic data, we found that rare (<1%) variants in the Genome Aggregation Database were significantly more annotated onto a protein domain in comparison to common (>1%) variants. Similarly, variants described as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar were more likely to be annotated onto a domain. In addition, we tested a dataset consisting of 60 causal variants in a cohort of patients with epileptic encephalopathy and found that 71% of them (43 variants) were propagated onto protein domains. In summary, we developed a resource that annotates variants in the coding part of the genome onto conserved protein domains in order to increase variant prioritization efficiency.Database URL: www.prot2hg.com.",True,False,7.0,,prot2hg,,16.9586895,ok,,genome aggregation database | clinvar,,v2,0.9586895,Prot2HG,True,True,True,,http://www.prot2hg.com,http://www.prot2hg.com,True,,1

Historically, most studies of pain-related genes have examined them in isolation or alongside a handful of other genes. More recently the use of systems biology techniques has enabled us to study genes in the context of the biological pathways and networks in which they operate. Here we describe a Web-based resource, available at http://www.PainNetworks.org. It integrates interaction data from various public databases with information on known pain genes taken from several sources (eg, The Pain Genes Database) and allows the user to examine a gene (or set of genes) of interest alongside known interaction partners. This information is displayed by the resource in the form of a network. The user can enrich these networks by using data from pain-focused gene expression studies to highlight genes that change expression in a given experiment or pairs of genes showing correlated expression patterns across different experiments. Genes in the networks are annotated in several ways including biological function and drug binding. The Web site can be used to find out more about a gene of interest by looking at the function of its interaction partners. It can also be used to interpret the results of a functional genomics experiment by revealing putative novel pain-related genes that have similar expression patterns to known pain-related genes and by ranking genes according to their network connections with known pain genes.

Proteome analyses of the bacterium can provide new insights into its pathophysiology and important facets of metabolic adaptation and, thus, aid the recognition of targets for intervention. However, the value of such proteome studies increases with their comprehensiveness. We present an MS-driven, proteome-wide characterization of the strain S. aureus HG001. Combining 144 high precision proteomic data sets, we identified 19 109 peptides from 2088 distinct S. aureus HG001 proteins, which account for 72% of the predicted ORFs. Peptides were further characterized concerning pI, GRAVY, and detectability scores in order to understand the low peptide coverage of 8.7% (19 109 out of 220 245 theoretical peptides). The high quality peptide-centric spectra have been organized into a comprehensive peptide fragmentation library (SpectraST) and used for identification of S. aureus-typic peptides in highly complex host-pathogen interaction experiments, which significantly improved the number of identified S. aureus proteins compared to a MASCOT search. This effort now allows the elucidation of crucial pathophysiological questions in S. aureus-specific host-pathogen interaction studies through comprehensive proteome analysis.

25428358,NCBI viral genomes resource.,"Recent technological innovations have ignited an explosion in virus genome sequencing that promises to fundamentally alter our understanding of viral biology and profoundly impact public health policy. Yet, any potential benefits from the billowing cloud of next generation sequence data hinge upon well implemented reference resources that facilitate the identification of sequences, aid in the assembly of sequence reads and provide reference annotation sources. The NCBI Viral Genomes Resource is a reference resource designed to bring order to this sequence shockwave and improve usability of viral sequence data. The resource can be accessed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/ and catalogs all publicly available virus genome sequences and curates reference genome sequences. As the number of genome sequences has grown, so too have the difficulties in annotating and maintaining reference sequences. The rapid expansion of the viral sequence universe has forced a recalibration of the data model to better provide extant sequence representation and enhanced reference sequence products to serve the needs of the various viral communities. This, in turn, has placed increased emphasis on leveraging the knowledge of individual scientific communities to identify important viral sequences and develop well annotated reference virus genome sets.",True,False,5.0,,viral genomes resource,,16.8973681,ok,,,,v2,0.8973681,,True,False,False,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/,True,...al sequence data.

Most of the tools available for the analysis of the resulting data are not easily applicable by less experienced users. ArrayAnalysis.org provides researchers with an easy-to-use and comprehensive interface to the functionality of R and Bioconductor packages for microarray data analysis. As a modular open source project, it allows developers to contribute modules that provide support for additional types of data or extend workflows.<h4>Results</h4>To enable data analysis of Illumina bead arrays for a broad user community, we have developed a module for ArrayAnalysis.org that provides a free and user-friendly web interface for quality control and pre-processing for these arrays. This module can be used together with existing modules for statistical and pathway analysis to provide a full workflow for Illumina gene expression data analysis. The module accepts data exported from Illumina's GenomeStudio, and provides the user with quality control plots and normalized data. The outputs are directly linked to the existing statistics module of ArrayAnalysis.org, but can also be downloaded for further downstream analysis in third-party tools.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Illumina bead arrays analysis module is available at http://www.arrayanalysis.org .

27795739,The Open Spectral Database: an open platform for sharing and searching spectral data.,"<h4>Background</h4>A number of websites make available spectral data for download (typically as JCAMP-DX text files) and one (ChemSpider) that also allows users to contribute spectral files. As a result, searching and retrieving such spectral data can be time consuming, and difficult to reuse if the data is compressed in the JCAMP-DX file. What is needed is a single resource that allows submission of JCAMP-DX files, export of the raw data in multiple formats, searching based on multiple chemical identifiers, and is open in terms of license and access. To address these issues a new online resource called the Open Spectral Database (OSDB) http://osdb.info/ has been developed and is now available. Built using open source tools, using open code (hosted on GitHub), providing open data, and open to community input about design and functionality, the OSDB is available for anyone to submit spectral data, making it searchable and available to the scientific community. This paper details the concept and coding, internal architecture, export formats, Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface and options for submission of data.<h4>Results</h4>The OSDB website went live in November 2015. Concurrently, the GitHub repository was made available at https://github.com/stuchalk/OSDB/, and is open for collaborators to join the project, submit issues, and contribute code.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The combination of a scripting environment (PHPStorm), a PHP Framework (CakePHP), a relational database (MySQL) and a code repository (GitHub) provides all the capabilities to easily develop REST based websites for ingestion, curation and exposure of open chemical data to the community at all levels.

The aim of the program is to advance research for many rare diseases. One of the first tasks toward achieving this goal was the development of a set of Common Data Elements (CDEs), which are controlled terminologies that represent collected data.

Although many data repositories allow users to browse their content, few support fine-grained, cross-cohort query and exploration at study-subject level. We introduce a cross-cohort query and exploration system, called X-search, to enable researchers to query patient cohort counts across a growing number of completed, NIH-funded studies in NSRR and explore the feasibility or likelihood of reusing the data for research studies.<h4>Methods</h4>X-search has been designed as a general framework with two loosely-coupled components: semantically annotated data repository and cross-cohort exploration engine. The semantically annotated data repository is comprised of a canonical data dictionary, data sources with a data dictionary, and mappings between each individual data dictionary and the canonical data dictionary. The cross-cohort exploration engine consists of five modules: query builder, graphical exploration, case-control exploration, query translation, and query execution. The canonical data dictionary serves as the unified metadata to drive the visual exploration interfaces and facilitate query translation through the mappings.<h4>Results</h4>X-search is publicly available at https://www.x-search.net/ with nine NSRR datasets consisting of over 26,000 unique subjects. The canonical data dictionary contains over 900 common data elements across the datasets. X-search has received over 1800 cross-cohort queries by users from 16 countries.<h4>Conclusions</h4>X-search provides a powerful cross-cohort exploration interface for querying and exploring heterogeneous datasets in the NSRR data repository, so as to enable researchers to evaluate the feasibility of potential research studies and generate potential hypotheses using the NSRR data.",True,False,5.0,,sleep research resource,,16.8740913,ok,,a large-scale,search | nsrr,v2,0.8740913,X-search,True,False,False,,https://www.x-search.net/ | http://www.x-search.net/,https://www.x-search.net/,True,"...<h4>Results</h4>X-search is publicly available at https://www.x-search.net/ with nine NSRR datasets consisting of over 26,000...",1
24223923,Viral IRES prediction system - a web server for prediction of the IRES secondary structure in silico.,"The internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) functions as cap-independent translation initiation sites in eukaryotic cells. IRES elements have been applied as useful tools for bi-cistronic expression vectors. Current RNA structure prediction programs are unable to predict precisely the potential IRES element. We have designed a viral IRES prediction system (VIPS) to perform the IRES secondary structure prediction. In order to obtain better results for the IRES prediction, the VIPS can evaluate and predict for all four different groups of IRESs with a higher accuracy. RNA secondary structure prediction, comparison, and pseudoknot prediction programs were implemented to form the three-stage procedure for the VIPS. The backbone of VIPS includes: the RNAL fold program, aimed to predict local RNA secondary structures by minimum free energy method; the RNA Align program, intended to compare predicted structures; and pknotsRG program, used to calculate the pseudoknot structure. VIPS was evaluated by using UTR database, IRES database and Virus database, and the accuracy rate of VIPS was assessed as 98.53%, 90.80%, 82.36% and 80.41% for IRES groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

33539887,ADDRESS: A Database of Disease-associated Human Variants Incorporating Protein Structure and Folding Stabilities.,"Numerous human diseases are caused by mutations in genomic sequences. Since amino acid changes affect protein function through mechanisms often predictable from protein structure, the integration of structural and sequence data enables us to estimate with greater accuracy whether and how a given mutation will lead to disease. Publicly available annotated databases enable hypothesis assessment and benchmarking of prediction tools. However, the results are often presented as summary statistics or black box predictors, without providing full descriptive information. We developed a new semi-manually curated human variant database presenting information on the protein contact-map, sequence-to-structure mapping, amino acid identity change, and stability prediction for the popular UniProt database. We found that the profiles of pathogenic and benign missense polymorphisms can be effectively deduced using decision trees and comparative analyses based on the presented dataset.

25053252,The Maize TFome--development of a transcription factor open reading frame collection for functional genomics.,"Establishing the architecture of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) responsible for controlling the transcription of all genes in an organism is a natural development that follows elucidation of the genome sequence. Reconstruction of the GRN requires the availability of a series of molecular tools and resources that so far have been limited to a few model organisms. One such resource consists of collections of transcription factor (TF) open reading frames (ORFs) cloned into vectors that facilitate easy expression in plants or microorganisms. In this study, we describe the development of a publicly available maize TF ORF collection (TFome) of 2034 clones corresponding to 2017 unique gene models in recombination-ready vectors that make possible the facile mobilization of the TF sequences into a number of different expression vectors. The collection also includes several hundred co-regulators (CoREGs), which we classified into well-defined families, and for which we propose here a standard nomenclature, as we have previously done for TFs. We describe the strategies employed to overcome the limitations associated with cloning ORFs from a genome that remains incompletely annotated, with a partial full-length cDNA set available, and with many TF/CoREG genes lacking experimental support. In many instances this required the combination of genome-wide expression data with gene synthesis approaches. The strategies developed will be valuable for developing similar resources for other agriculturally important plants.

Existing approach like Lipinski rule of 5 (Ro5), Operea have their own limitations. Thus, there is a need to develop computational method that can predict drug-likeness of a molecule with precision. In addition, there is a need to develop algorithm for screening chemical library for their drug-like properties.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we have used 1347 approved and 3206 experimental drugs for developing a knowledge-based computational model for predicting drug-likeness of a molecule. We have used freely available PaDEL software for computing molecular fingerprints/descriptors of the molecules for developing prediction models. Weka software has been used for feature selection in order to identify the best fingerprints. We have developed various classification models using different types of fingerprints like Estate, PubChem, Extended, FingerPrinter, MACCS keys, GraphsOnlyFP, SubstructureFP, Substructure FPCount, Klekota-RothFP, Klekota-Roth FPCount. It was observed that the models developed using MACCS keys based fingerprints, discriminated approved and experimental drugs with higher precision. Our model based on one hundred fifty nine MACCS keys predicted drug-likeness of the molecules with 89.96% accuracy along with 0.77 MCC. Our analysis indicated that MACCS keys (ISIS keys) 112, 122, 144, and 150 were highly prevalent in the approved drugs. The screening of ZINC (drug-like) and ChEMBL databases showed that around 78.33% and 72.43% of the compounds present in these databases had drug-like potential.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It was apparent from above study that the binary fingerprints could be used to discriminate approved and experimental drugs with high accuracy.

34020544,Ori-Finder 3: a web server for genome-wide prediction of replication origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"DNA replication is a fundamental process in all organisms; this event initiates at sites termed origins of replication. The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this species, origin prediction algorithms or web servers have been developed based on the sequence features of autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). However, their performances are far from satisfactory. By utilizing the Z-curve methodology, we present a novel pipeline, Ori-Finder 3, for the computational prediction of replication origins in S. cerevisiae at the genome-wide level based solely on DNA sequences. The ARS exhibiting both an AT-rich stretch and ARS consensus sequence element can be predicted at the single-nucleotide level. For the identified ARSs in the S. cerevisiae reference genome, 83 and 60% of the top 100 and top 300 predictions matched the known ARS records, respectively. Based on Ori-Finder 3, we subsequently built a database of the predicted ARSs identified in more than a hundred S. cerevisiae genomes.

Such assays are now frequently used to evaluate humoral responses in clinical trials. Integrated software is needed for the analysis, quality control, and secure sharing of the high volume of data produced by such multiplexed assays. Software that facilitates data exchange and provides flexibility to perform customized analyses (including multiple curve fits and visualizations of assay performance over time) could increase scientists' capacity to use these immunoassays to evaluate human clinical trials.<h4>Results</h4>The HIV Vaccine Trials Network and the Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research and Prevention collaborated with LabKey Software to enhance the open source LabKey Server platform to facilitate workflows for multiplexed bead assays. This system now supports the management, analysis, quality control, and secure sharing of data from multiplexed immunoassays that leverage Luminex xMAP® technology. These assays may be custom or kit-based. Newly added features enable labs to: (i) import run data from spreadsheets output by Bio-Plex Manager™ software; (ii) customize data processing, curve fits, and algorithms through scripts written in common languages, such as R; (iii) select script-defined calculation options through a graphical user interface; (iv) collect custom metadata for each titration, analyte, run and batch of runs; (v) calculate dose-response curves for titrations; (vi) interpolate unknown concentrations from curves for titrated standards; (vii) flag run data for exclusion from analysis; (viii) track quality control metrics across runs using Levey-Jennings plots; and (ix) automatically flag outliers based on expected values. Existing system features allow researchers to analyze, integrate, visualize, export and securely share their data, as well as to construct custom user interfaces and workflows.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Unlike other tools tailored for Luminex immunoassays, LabKey Server allows labs to customize their Luminex analyses using scripting while still presenting users with a single, graphical interface for processing and analyzing data.

27603574,Palindrome analyser - A new web-based server for predicting and evaluating inverted repeats in nucleotide sequences.,"DNA cruciform structures play an important role in the regulation of natural processes including gene replication and expression, as well as nucleosome structure and recombination. They have also been implicated in the evolution and development of diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Cruciform structures are formed by inverted repeats, and their stability is enhanced by DNA supercoiling and protein binding. They have received broad attention because of their important roles in biology. Computational approaches to study inverted repeats have allowed detailed analysis of genomes. However, currently there are no easily accessible and user-friendly tools that can analyse inverted repeats, especially among long nucleotide sequences. We have developed a web-based server, Palindrome analyser, which is a user-friendly application for analysing inverted repeats in various DNA (or RNA) sequences including genome sequences and oligonucleotides. It allows users to search and retrieve desired gene/nucleotide sequence entries from the NCBI databases, and provides data on length, sequence, locations and energy required for cruciform formation. Palindrome analyser also features an interactive graphical data representation of the distribution of the inverted repeats, with options for sorting according to the length of inverted repeat, length of loop, and number of mismatches.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is rapidly moving toward routine practice for patient and donor typing and has the potential to remedy some of the limitations of currently used platforms. However, a large-scale investigation into the blood group genotypes obtained by NGS in a multiethnic cohort is lacking. The 1000 Genomes Project provides information on genome variation among 2504 individuals representing 26 populations worldwide. We extracted their NGS data for all 36 blood group systems to a custom-designed database. In total, 210 412 alleles from 43 blood group-related genes were imported and curated. Matching algorithms were developed to compare them to blood group variants identified to date. Of the 1241 non-synonymous variants identified in the coding regions, 241 are known blood group polymorphisms. Interestingly, 357 of the remaining 1000 variants are predicted to occur on extracellular portions of 31 different blood group-carrying proteins and some may represent undiscovered antigens.

For example, reptiles are poorly represented in sequence databases, hindering functional evolutionary and developmental studies in these lineages substantially more diverse than mammals. In addition, different studies use different assembly and annotation protocols, inhibiting meaningful comparisons. Here, we present the ""Reptilian Transcriptomes Database 2.0,"" which provides extensive annotation of transcriptomes and genomes from species covering the major reptilian lineages. To this end, we sequenced normalized complementary DNA libraries of multiple adult tissues and various embryonic stages of the leopard gecko and the corn snake and gathered published reptilian sequence data sets from representatives of the four extant orders of reptiles: Squamata (snakes and lizards), the tuatara, crocodiles, and turtles. The LANE runner 2.0 software was implemented to annotate all assemblies within a single integrated pipeline. We show that this approach increases the annotation completeness of the assembled transcriptomes/genomes. We then built large concatenated protein alignments of single-copy genes and inferred phylogenetic trees that support the positions of turtles and the tuatara as sister groups of Archosauria and Squamata, respectively. The Reptilian Transcriptomes Database 2.0 resource will be updated to include selected new data sets as they become available, thus making it a reference for differential expression studies, comparative genomics and transcriptomics, linkage mapping, molecular ecology, and phylogenomic analyses involving reptiles.

Finding more plausible NES functioning regions among the vast array of consensus-matching segments would provide an interesting resource for further experimental validation. Better defined NES should also allow meaningful mapping of cancer-related mutation positions, leading to plausible explanations for the relationship between nuclear export and disease.<h4>Results</h4>Possible NES candidate regions are extracted from the cancer-related human reference proteome. Extracted NES are scored for reliability by combining sequence-based and structure-based approaches. The confidently identified NES candidate motifs were checked for overlap with cancer-related mutation positions annotated in the COSMIC database. Among the ∼700 cancer-related sequences in the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, 178 sequences are predicted to have possible NES motifs containing cancer-related mutations at their key positions.

Here, we describe the rationale and design of the currently ongoing HBS. The HBS is examining a population-based sample of 1,000 healthy participants (age 30-39) who are thoroughly studied across an entire year. Data are collected through cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological testing, neuroimaging, bio-sampling, questionnaires, ecological momentary assessment, and real-world assessments using wearable devices. These data will become an accessible resource for the scientific community enabling the next step in understanding the human brain and how it dynamically and individually operates in its bio-social context.

24040164,Genome-wide discovery and information resource development of DNA polymorphisms in cassava.,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important crop that provides food security and income generation in many tropical countries, and is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its draft genome sequence and many expressed sequence tags are now publicly available, allowing the development of cassava polymorphism information. Here, we describe the genome-wide discovery of cassava DNA polymorphisms. Using the alignment of predicted transcribed sequences from the cassava draft genome sequence and ESTs from GenBank, we discovered 10,546 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 647 insertions and deletions. To facilitate molecular marker development for cassava, we designed 9,316 PCR primer pairs to amplify the genomic region around each DNA polymorphism. Of the discovered SNPs, 62.7% occurred in protein-coding regions. Disease-resistance genes were found to have a significantly higher ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitutions. We identified 24 read-through (changes of a stop codon to a coding codon) and 38 premature stop (changes of a coding codon to a stop codon) single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and found that the 5 gene ontology terms in biological process were significantly different in genes with read-through single-nucleotide polymorphisms compared with all cassava genes.

29363422,Construction of Pará rubber tree genome and multi-transcriptome database accelerates rubber researches.,"<h4>Background</h4>Natural rubber is an economically important material. Currently the Pará rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis is the main commercial source. Little is known about rubber biosynthesis at the molecular level. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies brought draft genomes of three rubber cultivars and a variety of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. However, no current genome or transcriptome databases (DB) are organized by gene.<h4>Results</h4>A gene-oriented database is a valuable support for rubber research. Based on our original draft genome sequence of H. brasiliensis RRIM600, we constructed a rubber tree genome and transcriptome DB. Our DB provides genome information including gene functional annotations and multi-transcriptome data of RNA-seq, full-length cDNAs including PacBio Isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq), ESTs and genome wide transcription start sites (TSSs) derived from CAGE technology. Using our original and publically available RNA-seq data, we calculated co-expressed genes for identifying functionally related gene sets and/or genes regulated by the same transcription factor (TF). Users can access multi-transcriptome data through both a gene-oriented web page and a genome browser. For the gene searching system, we provide keyword search, sequence homology search and gene expression search; users can also select their expression threshold easily.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The rubber genome and transcriptome DB provides rubber tree genome sequence and multi-transcriptomics data. This DB is useful for comprehensive understanding of the rubber transcriptome. This will assist both industrial and academic researchers for rubber and economically important close relatives such as R. communis, M. esculenta and J. curcas.

22676320,Quartet decomposition server: a platform for analyzing phylogenetic trees.,"<h4>Background</h4>The frequent exchange of genetic material among prokaryotes means that extracting a majority or plurality phylogenetic signal from many gene families, and the identification of gene families that are in significant conflict with the plurality signal is a frequent task in comparative genomics, and especially in phylogenomic analyses. Decomposition of gene trees into embedded quartets (unrooted trees each with four taxa) is a convenient and statistically powerful technique to address this challenging problem. This approach was shown to be useful in several studies of completely sequenced microbial genomes.<h4>Results</h4>We present here a web server that takes a collection of gene phylogenies, decomposes them into quartets, generates a Quartet Spectrum, and draws a split network. Users are also provided with various data download options for further analyses. Each gene phylogeny is to be represented by an assessment of phylogenetic information content, such as sets of trees reconstructed from bootstrap replicates or sampled from a posterior distribution.

28857516,Modeling of the hERG K+ Channel Blockage Using Online Chemical Database and Modeling Environment (OCHEM).,"Human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) K+ channel plays an important role in cardiac action potential. Blockage of hERG channel may result in long QT syndrome (LQTS), even cause sudden cardiac death. Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market because of the serious hERG-related cardiotoxicity. Therefore, it is quite essential to estimate the chemical blockage of hERG in the early stage of drug discovery. In this study, a diverse set of 3721 compounds with hERG inhibition data was assembled from literature. Then, we make full use of the Online Chemical Modeling Environment (OCHEM), which supplies rich machine learning methods and descriptor sets, to build a series of classification models for hERG blockage. We also generated two consensus models based on the top-performing individual models. The consensus models performed much better than the individual models both on 5-fold cross validation and external validation. Especially, consensus model II yielded the prediction accuracy of 89.5 % and MCC of 0.670 on external validation. This result indicated that the predictive power of consensus model II should be stronger than most of the previously reported models.

32209622,"Severe Asthma Toolkit: an online resource for multidisciplinary health professionals-needs assessment, development process and user analytics with survey feedback.","<h4>Objectives</h4>Severe asthma imposes a significant burden on individuals, families and the healthcare system. New treatment and management approaches are emerging as effective options for severe asthma. Translating new knowledge to multidisciplinary healthcare professionals is a priority. We developed 'The Severe Asthma Toolkit' (https://toolkit.severeasthma.org.au) to increase awareness of severe asthma, provide evidence-based resources and support decisionmaking by healthcare providers.<h4>Setting</h4>Roundtable discussions and a survey of Australians clinicians were conducted to determine clinician preferences, format and content for a severe asthma resource.<h4>Participants</h4>A reference group from stakeholder and consumer bodies and severe asthma experts provided advice and feedback. A multidisciplinary team of international experts was engaged to develop content. Written content was based on up-to-date literature. Peer and editorial review were performed to finalise content and inform web design. Website design focused on user experience, navigation, engagement, interactivity and tailoring of content for a clinical audience.<h4>Results</h4>A web-based resource was developed. Roundtable discussions and a needs assessment survey identified the need for dedicated severe asthma management resources to support skills training. The end-product, which launched 26 March 2018, includes an overview of severe asthma, diagnosis and assessment, management, medications, comorbidities, living with severe asthma, establishing a clinic, paediatrics/adolescents and clinical resources. Analytics indicate access by users worldwide (32 169 users from 169 countries). User survey results (n=394) confirm access by the target audience (72% health professionals), who agreed the toolkit increased their knowledge (73%) and confidence in managing severe asthma (66%), and 75% are likely to use the resource in clinic.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Severe Asthma Toolkit is a unique, evidence-based internet resource to support healthcare professionals providing optimal care for people with severe asthma.

31904820,BCdatabaser: on-the-fly reference database creation for (meta-)barcoding.,"<h4>Summary</h4>DNA barcoding and meta-barcoding have become irreplaceable in research and applications, where identification of taxa alone or within a mixture, respectively, becomes relevant. Pioneering studies were in the microbiological context, yet nowadays also plants and animals become targeted. Given the variety of markers used, formatting requirements for classifiers and constant growth of primary databases, there is a need for dedicated reference database creation. We developed a web and command-line interface to generate such on-the-fly for any applicable marker and taxonomic group with optional filtering, formatting and restriction specific for (meta-)barcoding purposes.

While experimental data on the boundaries of membrane-embedded regions are sparse, this information is present in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps and it has not been utilized yet for determining membrane regions. We developed a computational pipeline, where the inputs of a cryo-EM map, the corresponding atomistic structure, and the potential bilayer orientation determined by TMDET algorithm of a given protein result in an output defining the residues assigned to the bulk water phase, lipid interface and the lipid hydrophobic core. Based on this method, we built a database involving published cryo-EM protein structures and a server to be able to compute this data for newly obtained structures.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://memblob.hegelab.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,7.0,,memblob,,16.6542532,ok,,,,v2,0.6542532,,True,False,False,,http://memblob.hegelab.org,http://memblob.hegelab.org,True,...tructures.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://memblob.hegelab.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1

27893392,Waterloo Exploration Database: New Challenges for Image Quality Assessment Models.,"The great content diversity of real-world digital images poses a grand challenge to image quality assessment (IQA) models, which are traditionally designed and validated on a handful of commonly used IQA databases with very limited content variation. To test the generalization capability and to facilitate the wide usage of IQA techniques in real-world applications, we establish a large-scale database named the Waterloo Exploration Database, which in its current state contains 4744 pristine natural images and 94 880 distorted images created from them. Instead of collecting the mean opinion score for each image via subjective testing, which is extremely difficult if not impossible, we present three alternative test criteria to evaluate the performance of IQA models, namely, the pristine/distorted image discriminability test, the listwise ranking consistency test, and the pairwise preference consistency test (P-test). We compare 20 well-known IQA models using the proposed criteria, which not only provide a stronger test in a more challenging testing environment for existing models, but also demonstrate the additional benefits of using the proposed database. For example, in the P-test, even for the best performing no-reference IQA model, more than 6 million failure cases against the model are ""discovered"" automatically out of over 1 billion test pairs. Furthermore, we discuss how the new database may be exploited using innovative approaches in the future, to reveal the weaknesses of existing IQA models, to provide insights on how to improve the models, and to shed light on how the next-generation IQA models may be developed.

21592376,Mapping randomized controlled trials of treatments for eczema--the GREAT database (the Global Resource of EczemA Trials: a collection of key data on randomized controlled trials of treatments for eczema from 2000 to 2010).,"<h4>Background</h4>Massive duplication of effort occurs when researchers all over the world undertake extensive searches for randomized controlled trials when preparing systematic reviews, when developing evidence-based guidelines and when applying for research funding for eczema treatments. Such duplication wastes valuable resources.Searching for randomized controlled trials of eczema is a laborious task involving scrutiny of thousands of individual references from diverse electronic databases in order to obtain a few papers of interest. Clinicians and patients who wish to find out more about a particular treatment are at risk of missing the relevant evidence if they are not trained in electronic bibliographic searching. Systematic reviews cannot be relied upon to comprehensively inform current optimal eczema treatments due to incomplete coverage and because many may be out of date.An international, publically available and comprehensive resource which brings together all randomized controlled trials on eczema treatment using a highly sensitive search has the potential to release more filtered knowledge about patient care to those who need it most and to significantly shorten the duration and costs of many clinical eczema research and guideline projects.<h4>Description</h4>The Global Resource of EczemA Trials brings together information on all randomized controlled trials of eczema treatments published from the beginning of 2000 up to the end of 2010 and will be updated every month.We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library and the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, AMED and CINHAL databases. We included 268 RCTs (24th March 2011) covering over 70 different treatment interventions.The structure of the Global Resource of Eczema Trials allows the user as much, or as little, specificity when retrieving information on trials as they wish, in an easy to use format. For each trial, the database gives the citation for the published report and also provides enough information to enable a user to decide whether the trial is worth further scrutiny.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Global Resource of Eczema Trials has been created to facilitate knowledge mobilization into healthcare and to reduce wastage of research time through unnecessary duplication.

Using EPICO, large epigenome projects can make available their rich datasets to the community without requiring specific technical skills. As a first instance of EPICO, we implemented the BLUEPRINT Data Analysis Portal (BDAP). BDAP provides a desktop for the comparative analysis of epigenomes of hematopoietic cell types based on results, such as the position of epigenetic features, from basic analysis pipelines. The BDAP interface facilitates interactive exploration of genomic regions, genes, and pathways in the context of differentiation of hematopoietic lineages.

27087306,Improving HIV proteome annotation: new features of BioAfrica HIV Proteomics Resource.,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the pathogens that cause the greatest global concern, with approximately 35 million people currently infected with HIV. Extensive HIV research has been performed, generating a large amount of HIV and host genomic data. However, no effective vaccine that protects the host from HIV infection is available and HIV is still spreading at an alarming rate, despite effective antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. In order to develop effective therapies, we need to expand our knowledge of the interaction between HIV and host proteins. In contrast to virus proteins, which often rapidly evolve drug resistance mutations, the host proteins are essentially invariant within all humans. Thus, if we can identify the host proteins needed for virus replication, such as those involved in transporting viral proteins to the cell surface, we have a chance of interrupting viral replication. There is no proteome resource that summarizes this interaction, making research on this subject a difficult enterprise. In order to fill this gap in knowledge, we curated a resource presents detailed annotation on the interaction between the HIV proteome and host proteins. Our resource was produced in collaboration with ViralZone and used manual curation techniques developed by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Our new website also used previous annotations of the BioAfrica HIV-1 Proteome Resource, which has been accessed by approximately 10 000 unique users a year since its inception in 2005. The novel features include a dedicated new page for each HIV protein, a graphic display of its function and a section on its interaction with host proteins. Our new webpages also add information on the genomic location of each HIV protein and the position of ARV drug resistance mutations.

We developed protr, a comprehensive R package for generating various numerical representation schemes of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequence. The package calculates eight descriptor groups composed of 22 types of commonly used descriptors that include about 22 700 descriptor values. It allows users to select amino acid properties from the AAindex database, and use self-defined properties to construct customized descriptors. For proteochemometric modeling, it calculates six types of scales-based descriptors derived by various dimensionality reduction methods. The protr package also integrates the functionality of similarity score computation derived by protein sequence alignment and Gene Ontology semantic similarity measures within a list of proteins, and calculates profile-based protein features based on position-specific scoring matrix. We also developed ProtrWeb, a user-friendly web server for calculating descriptors presented in the protr package.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The protr package is freely available from CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/package=protr, ProtrWeb, is freely available at http://protrweb.scbdd.com/.",True,False,7.0,,protrweb,,16.569950640000002,ok,,,,v2,0.56995064,protr/ProtrWeb,True,False,False,,http://cran.r-project.org/package=protr | http://protrweb.scbdd.com/,http://cran.r-project.org/package=protr,True,"...>The protr package is freely available from CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/package=protr, ProtrWeb, is freely available at http://protrweb...",1

However, lack of genome-wide association studies on large and epidemiologically well-defined strain collections from the same species makes it difficult to identify the genes under positive selection and define adaptive polymorphisms in those genes. To address this need and to overcome existing limitations, we propose to create a ""microbial variome""--a species-specific resource database of genomic variations based on molecular evolutionary analysis. Here, we present prototype variome databases of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica (http://depts.washington.edu/sokurel/variome, last accessed March 26, 2013).

33326193,Large expert-curated database for benchmarking document similarity detection in biomedical literature search.,"Document recommendation systems for locating relevant literature have mostly relied on methods developed a decade ago. This is largely due to the lack of a large offline gold-standard benchmark of relevant documents that cover a variety of research fields such that newly developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed articles. The collected data cover 76% of all unique PubMed Medical Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across different experience levels, research fields or time spent on annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles. The established database server located at https://relishdb.ict.griffith.edu.au is freely available for the downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods.

28673048,Taming the BEAST-A Community Teaching Material Resource for BEAST 2.,"Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in modern evolutionary biology. Phylogenetic methods reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among organisms, whereas phylodynamic approaches reveal the underlying diversification processes that lead to the observed relationships. These two fields have many practical applications in disciplines as diverse as epidemiology, developmental biology, palaeontology, ecology, and linguistics. The combination of increasingly large genetic data sets and increases in computing power is facilitating the development of more sophisticated phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods. Big data sets allow us to answer complex questions. However, since the required analyses are highly specific to the particular data set and question, a black-box method is not sufficient anymore. Instead, biologists are required to be actively involved with modeling decisions during data analysis. The modular design of the Bayesian phylogenetic software package BEAST 2 enables, and in fact enforces, this involvement. At the same time, the modular design enables computational biology groups to develop new methods at a rapid rate. A thorough understanding of the models and algorithms used by inference software is a critical prerequisite for successful hypothesis formulation and assessment. In particular, there is a need for more readily available resources aimed at helping interested scientists equip themselves with the skills to confidently use cutting-edge phylogenetic analysis software. These resources will also benefit researchers who do not have access to similar courses or training at their home institutions.

23815072,Jenner-predict server: prediction of protein vaccine candidates (PVCs) in bacteria based on host-pathogen interactions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Subunit vaccines based on recombinant proteins have been effective in preventing infectious diseases and are expected to meet the demands of future vaccine development. Computational approach, especially reverse vaccinology (RV) method has enormous potential for identification of protein vaccine candidates (PVCs) from a proteome. The existing protective antigen prediction software and web servers have low prediction accuracy leading to limited applications for vaccine development. Besides machine learning techniques, those software and web servers have considered only protein's adhesin-likeliness as criterion for identification of PVCs. Several non-adhesin functional classes of proteins involved in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis are known to provide protection against bacterial infections. Therefore, knowledge of bacterial pathogenesis has potential to identify PVCs.<h4>Results</h4>A web server, Jenner-Predict, has been developed for prediction of PVCs from proteomes of bacterial pathogens. The web server targets host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis by considering known functional domains from protein classes such as adhesin, virulence, invasin, porin, flagellin, colonization, toxin, choline-binding, penicillin-binding, transferring-binding, fibronectin-binding and solute-binding. It predicts non-cytosolic proteins containing above domains as PVCs. It also provides vaccine potential of PVCs in terms of their possible immunogenicity by comparing with experimentally known IEDB epitopes, absence of autoimmunity and conservation in different strains. Predicted PVCs are prioritized so that only few prospective PVCs could be validated experimentally. The performance of web server was evaluated against known protective antigens from diverse classes of bacteria reported in Protegen database and datasets used for VaxiJen server development. The web server efficiently predicted known vaccine candidates reported from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli proteomes. The Jenner-Predict server outperformed NERVE, Vaxign and VaxiJen methods. It has sensitivity of 0.774 and 0.711 for Protegen and VaxiJen dataset, respectively while specificity of 0.940 has been obtained for the latter dataset.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Better prediction accuracy of Jenner-Predict web server signifies that domains involved in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis are better criteria for prediction of PVCs. The web server has successfully predicted maximum known PVCs belonging to different functional classes.

Despite extensive efforts in elucidating direct protein interactions, our knowledge on the complete spectrum of protein associations remains limited. We therefore developed a new approach that detects protein associations from identifications obtained after re-processing of large-scale, public mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. Our approach infers protein association based on the co-occurrence of proteins across many different proteomics experiments, and provides information that is almost completely complementary to traditional direct protein interaction studies. We here present a web interface to query and explore the associations derived from this method, called the online Tabloid Proteome. The online Tabloid Proteome also integrates biological knowledge from several existing resources to annotate our derived protein associations.

Disease risk estimates are a key feature to target control interventions, and serve as a benchmark for monitoring and evaluation. What is currently missing is a georeferenced global database for NTDs providing open-access to the available survey data that is constantly updated and can be utilized by researchers and disease control managers to support other relevant stakeholders. We describe the steps taken toward the development of such a database that can be employed for spatial disease risk modeling and control of NTDs.<h4>Methodology</h4>With an emphasis on schistosomiasis in Africa, we systematically searched the literature (peer-reviewed journals and 'grey literature'), contacted Ministries of Health and research institutions in schistosomiasis-endemic countries for location-specific prevalence data and survey details (e.g., study population, year of survey and diagnostic techniques). The data were extracted, georeferenced, and stored in a MySQL database with a web interface allowing free database access and data management.<h4>Principal findings</h4>At the beginning of 2011, our database contained more than 12,000 georeferenced schistosomiasis survey locations from 35 African countries available under http://www.gntd.org. Currently, the database is expanded to a global repository, including a host of other NTDs, e.g. soil-transmitted helminthiasis and leishmaniasis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>An open-access, spatially explicit NTD database offers unique opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, disease monitoring, and surveillance.

35165687,The United States Swine Pathogen Database: integrating veterinary diagnostic laboratory sequence data to monitor emerging pathogens of swine.,"Veterinary diagnostic laboratories derive thousands of nucleotide sequences from clinical samples of swine pathogens such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Senecavirus A and swine enteric coronaviruses. In addition, next generation sequencing has resulted in the rapid production of full-length genomes. Presently, sequence data are released to diagnostic clients but are not publicly available as data may be associated with sensitive information. However, these data can be used for field-relevant vaccines; determining where and when pathogens are spreading; have relevance to research in molecular and comparative virology; and are a component in pandemic preparedness efforts. We have developed a centralized sequence database that integrates private clinical data using PRRSV data as an exemplar, alongside publicly available genomic information. We implemented the Tripal toolkit, a collection of Drupal modules that are used to manage, visualize and disseminate biological data stored within the Chado database schema. New sequences sourced from diagnostic laboratories contain: genomic information; date of collection; collection location; and a unique identifier. Users can download annotated genomic sequences using a customized search interface that incorporates data mined from published literature; search for similar sequences using BLAST-based tools; and explore annotated reference genomes. Additionally, custom annotation pipelines have determined species, the location of open reading frames and nonstructural proteins and the occurrence of putative frame shifts. Eighteen swine pathogens have been curated. The database provides researchers access to sequences discovered by veterinary diagnosticians, allowing for epidemiological and comparative virology studies.

28077566,"Duplicates, redundancies and inconsistencies in the primary nucleotide databases: a descriptive study.","GenBank, the EMBL European Nucleotide Archive and the DNA DataBank of Japan, known collectively as the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration or INSDC, are the three most significant nucleotide sequence databases. Their records are derived from laboratory work undertaken by different individuals, by different teams, with a range of technologies and assumptions and over a period of decades. As a consequence, they contain a great many duplicates, redundancies and inconsistencies, but neither the prevalence nor the characteristics of various types of duplicates have been rigorously assessed. Existing duplicate detection methods in bioinformatics only address specific duplicate types, with inconsistent assumptions; and the impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases has not been carefully assessed, making it difficult to judge the value of such methods. Our goal is to assess the scale, kinds and impact of duplicates in bioinformatics databases, through a retrospective analysis of merged groups in INSDC databases. Our outcomes are threefold: (1) We analyse a benchmark dataset consisting of duplicates manually identified in INSDC-a dataset of 67 888 merged groups with 111 823 duplicate pairs across 21 organisms from INSDC databases - in terms of the prevalence, types and impacts of duplicates. (2) We categorize duplicates at both sequence and annotation level, with supporting quantitative statistics, showing that different organisms have different prevalence of distinct kinds of duplicate. (3) We show that the presence of duplicates has practical impact via a simple case study on duplicates, in terms of GC content and melting temperature. We demonstrate that duplicates not only introduce redundancy, but can lead to inconsistent results for certain tasks. Our findings lead to a better understanding of the problem of duplication in biological databases.Database URL: the merged records are available at https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/Xef2fvsebBEAv9w.",True,False,3.0,,,insdc,13.54114723,ok,insdc | international nucleotide sequence database collaboration,genbank | european nucleotide archive | international nucleotide sequence database collaboration,,spacy+v2,0.54114723,"Duplicates, redundancies and inconsistencies in the primary nucleotide databases",True,False,False,,https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/Xef2fvsebBEAv9w,https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/Xef2fvsebBEAv9w,True,...Database URL: the merged records are available at https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/Xef2fvsebBEAv9w.,1
22857741,e-MIR2: a public online inventory of medical informatics resources.,"<h4>Background</h4>Over the past years, the number of available informatics resources in medicine has grown exponentially. While specific inventories of such resources have already begun to be developed for Bioinformatics (BI), comparable inventories are as yet not available for the Medical Informatics (MI) field, so that locating and accessing them currently remains a difficult and time-consuming task.<h4>Description</h4>We have created a repository of MI resources from the scientific literature, providing free access to its contents through a web-based service. We define informatics resources as all those elements that constitute, serve to define or are used by informatics systems, ranging from architectures or development methodologies to terminologies, vocabularies, databases or tools. Relevant information describing the resources is automatically extracted from manuscripts published in top-ranked MI journals. We used a pattern matching approach to detect the resources' names and their main features. Detected resources are classified according to three different criteria: functionality, resource type and domain. To facilitate these tasks, we have built three different classification schemas by following a novel approach based on folksonomies and social tagging. We adopted the terminology most frequently used by MI researchers in their publications to create the concepts and hierarchical relationships belonging to the classification schemas. The classification algorithm identifies the categories associated with resources and annotates them accordingly. The database is then populated with this data after manual curation and validation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have created an online repository of MI resources to assist researchers in locating and accessing the most suitable resources to perform specific tasks. The database contains 609 resources at the time of writing and is available at http://www.gib.fi.upm.es/eMIR2.

22333244,ShapePheno: unsupervised extraction of shape phenotypes from biological image collections.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Accurate large-scale phenotyping has recently gained considerable importance in biology. For example, in genome-wide association studies technological advances have rendered genotyping cheap, leaving phenotype acquisition as the major bottleneck. Automatic image analysis is one major strategy to phenotype individuals in large numbers. Current approaches for visual phenotyping focus predominantly on summarizing statistics and geometric measures, such as height and width of an individual, or color histograms and patterns. However, more subtle, but biologically informative phenotypes, such as the local deformation of the shape of an individual with respect to the population mean cannot be automatically extracted and quantified by current techniques.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a probabilistic machine learning model that allows for the extraction of deformation phenotypes from biological images, making them available as quantitative traits for downstream analysis. Our approach jointly models a collection of images using a learned common template that is mapped onto each image through a deformable smooth transformation. In a case study, we analyze the shape deformations of 388 guppy fish (Poecilia reticulata). We find that the flexible shape phenotypes our model extracts are complementary to basic geometric measures. Moreover, these quantitative traits assort the observations into distinct groups and can be mapped to polymorphic genetic loci of the sample set.<h4>Availability</h4>Code is available under: http://bioweb.me/GEBI  CONTACT:  theofanis.karaletsos@tuebingen.mpg.de; oliver.stegle@tuebingen.mpg.de<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,3.0,,shapepheno,,11.99651116,ok,,,,v2,0.99651116,ShapePheno,True,True,True,,http://bioweb.me/GEBI,http://bioweb.me/GEBI,True,...set.<h4>Availability</h4>Code is available under: http://bioweb.me/GEBI  CONTACT:  theofanis.karaletsos@tuebingen.mpg.de;...,1

They play an important role in the marine carbon cycle, and their exceptional fossil record serves as the basis for biochronostratigraphy and past climate reconstructions. A major worldwide sampling effort over the last two decades has resulted in the establishment of multiple large collections of cryopreserved individual planktonic foraminifera samples. Thousands of 18S rDNA partial sequences have been generated, representing all major known morphological taxa across their worldwide oceanic range. This comprehensive data coverage provides an opportunity to assess patterns of molecular ecology and evolution in a holistic way for an entire group of planktonic protists.

30020956,ProfPPIdb: Pairs of physical protein-protein interactions predicted for entire proteomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in many cellular processes. Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods.<h4>Results</h4>We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, recent methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods. Our approach is independent of domain-knowledge and leverages evolutionary information. The database interface representing our results is accessible from https://rostlab.org/services/ppipair/.

26108279,GDC 2: Compression of large collections of genomes.,"The fall of prices of the high-throughput genome sequencing changes the landscape of modern genomics. A number of large scale projects aimed at sequencing many human genomes are in progress. Genome sequencing also becomes an important aid in the personalized medicine. One of the significant side effects of this change is a necessity of storage and transfer of huge amounts of genomic data. In this paper we deal with the problem of compression of large collections of complete genomic sequences. We propose an algorithm that is able to compress the collection of 1092 human diploid genomes about 9,500 times. This result is about 4 times better than what is offered by the other existing compressors. Moreover, our algorithm is very fast as it processes the data with speed 200 MB/s on a modern workstation. In a consequence the proposed algorithm allows storing the complete genomic collections at low cost, e.g., the examined collection of 1092 human genomes needs only about 700 MB when compressed, what can be compared to about 6.7 TB of uncompressed FASTA files.

There is a growing need for a rapid and accurate identification of pathogens to enable early diagnosis and targeted antifungal therapy. Morphological and biochemical identification methods are time-consuming and require trained experts. Alternatively, molecular methods, such as DNA barcoding, a powerful and easy tool for rapid monophasic identification, offer a practical approach for species identification and less demanding in terms of taxonomical expertise. However, its wide-spread use is still limited by a lack of quality-controlled reference databases and the evolving recognition and definition of new fungal species/complexes.

30718155,Utilising a Data Capture Tool to Populate a Cardiac Rehabilitation Registry: A Feasibility Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Clinical registries are effective for monitoring clinical practice, yet manual data collection can limit their implementation and sustainability. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a data capture tool to collect cardiac rehabilitation (CR) minimum variables from electronic hospital administration databases to populate a new CR registry in Australia.<h4>Methods</h4>Two CR facilities located in Melbourne, Australia participated, providing data on 42 variables including: patient socio-demographics, risk factors and co-morbidities, CR program information (e.g. number of CR sessions), process indicators (e.g. wait time) and patient outcomes (e.g. change in exercise capacity). A pre-programmed, automated data capture tool (GeneRic Health Network Information for the Enterprise [20]: https://www.grhanite.com/) (GRHANITE™) was installed at the sites to extract data available in an electronic format from hospital sites. Additionally, clinicians entered data on CR patients into a purpose-built web-based tool (Research Electronic Data Capture: https://www.project-redcap.org/) (REDCap). Formative evaluation including staff feedback was collected.<h4>Results</h4>The GRHANITE™ tool was successfully installed at the two CR sites and data from 176 patients (median age = 67 years, 76% male) were securely extracted between September-December 2017. Data pulled electronically from hospital databases was limited to seven of the 42 requested variables. This is due to CR sites only capturing basic patient information (e.g. socio-demographics, CR appointment bookings) in hospital administrative databases. The remaining clinical information required for the CR registry was collected in formats (e.g. paper-based, scanned or Excel spreadsheet) deemed unusable for electronic data capture. Manually entered data into the web-tool enabled data collection on all remaining variables. Compared to historical methods of data collection, CR staff reported that the REDCap tool reduced data entry time.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The key benefits of a scalable, automated data capture tool like GRHANITE™ cannot be fully realised in settings with under-developed electronic health infrastructure.

We developed primer pairs for all of the identified EST-SSRs (eSSRs) and selected 673 of these pairs at random for further validation. 575 pairs (85%) gave successful amplification, of which, 464 (80.7%) were polymorphic in six to 24 individuals from natural populations across Northern China. We also tested the transferability of the polymorphic eSSRs to nine other Populus species. In addition, to facilitate the use of these new eSSR markers by other researchers, we mapped them onto Populus trichocarpa scaffolds in silico and compiled our data into a web-based database (http://202.205.131.253:8080/poplar/resources/static_page/index.html).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The large set of validated eSSRs identified in this work will have many potential applications in studies on P. euphratica and other poplar species, in fields such as population genetics, comparative genomics, linkage mapping, QTL, and marker-assisted breeding.

29899502,Development of a consent resource for genomic data sharing in the clinical setting.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Data sharing between clinicians, laboratories, and patients is essential for improvements in genomic medicine, but obtaining consent for individual-level data sharing is often hindered by a lack of time and resources. To address this issue, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) developed tools to facilitate consent, including a one-page consent form and online supplemental video with information on key topics, such as risks and benefits of data sharing.<h4>Methods</h4>To determine whether the consent form and video accurately conveyed key data sharing concepts, we surveyed 5,162 members of the general public. We measured comprehension at baseline, after reading the form and watching the video. Additionally, we assessed participants' attitudes toward genomic data sharing.<h4>Results</h4>Participants' performance on comprehension questions significantly improved over baseline after reading the form and continued to improve after watching the video.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Results suggest reading the form alone provided participants with important knowledge regarding broad data sharing, and watching the video allowed for broader comprehension.

24886202,An R package that automatically collects and archives details for reproducible computing.,"<h4>Background</h4>It is scientifically and ethically imperative that the results of statistical analysis of biomedical research data be computationally reproducible in the sense that the reported results can be easily recapitulated from the study data. Some statistical analyses are computationally a function of many data files, program files, and other details that are updated or corrected over time. In many applications, it is infeasible to manually maintain an accurate and complete record of all these details about a particular analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Therefore, we developed the rctrack package that automatically collects and archives read only copies of program files, data files, and other details needed to computationally reproduce an analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The rctrack package uses the trace function to temporarily embed detail collection procedures into functions that read files, write files, or generate random numbers so that no special modifications of the primary R program are necessary. At the conclusion of the analysis, rctrack uses these details to automatically generate a read only archive of data files, program files, result files, and other details needed to recapitulate the analysis results. Information about this archive may be included as an appendix of a report generated by Sweave or knitR. Here, we describe the usage, implementation, and other features of the rctrack package.

This can be especially true in cases such as Alzheimer's disease, where the access to biological samples, along with well-defined patient information can be challenging. Considering the inflammatory part of Alzheimer's disease, our aim was to examine the presence of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides in human proteomic datasets deposited in the publicly available proteomics database ProteomeXchange (http://www.proteomexchange.org/). First, a unified, comprehensive human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptide database, containing all known human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides was constructed and used along with the datasets containing high-quality proteomics data originating from the examination of Alzheimer's disease and control groups. A throughout network analysis was carried out, and the enriched GO functions were examined. Less than 1% of all identified proteins in the brain were antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides, but the alterations characteristic of Alzheimer's disease could be recapitulated with their analysis. Our data emphasize the key role of the innate immune system and blood clotting in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

31558563,Modeling Cellular Response in Large-Scale Radiogenomic Databases to Advance Precision Radiotherapy.,"Radiotherapy is integral to the care of a majority of patients with cancer. Despite differences in tumor responses to radiation (radioresponse), dose prescriptions are not currently tailored to individual patients. Recent large-scale cancer cell line databases hold the promise of unravelling the complex molecular arrangements underlying cellular response to radiation, which is critical for novel predictive biomarker discovery. Here, we present RadioGx, a computational platform for integrative analyses of radioresponse using radiogenomic databases. We fit the dose-response data within RadioGx to the linear-quadratic model. The imputed survival across a range of dose levels (AUC) was a robust radioresponse indicator that correlated with biological processes known to underpin the cellular response to radiation. Using AUC as a metric for further investigations, we found that radiation sensitivity was significantly associated with disruptive mutations in genes related to nonhomologous end joining. Next, by simulating the effects of different oxygen levels, we identified putative genes that may influence radioresponse specifically under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, using transcriptomic data, we found evidence for tissue-specific determinants of radioresponse, suggesting that tumor type could influence the validity of putative predictive biomarkers of radioresponse. Finally, integrating radioresponse with drug response data, we found that drug classes impacting the cytoskeleton, DNA replication, and mitosis display similar therapeutic effects to ionizing radiation on cancer cell lines. In summary, RadioGx provides a unique computational toolbox for hypothesis generation to advance preclinical research for radiation oncology and precision medicine. SIGNIFICANCE: The RadioGx computational platform enables integrative analyses of cellular response to radiation with drug responses and genome-wide molecular data.

26921280,Resolving the problem of multiple accessions of the same transcript deposited across various public databases.,"Maintaining the consistency of genomic annotations is an increasingly complex task because of the iterative and dynamic nature of assembly and annotation, growing numbers of biological databases and insufficient integration of annotations across databases. As information exchange among databases is poor, a 'novel' sequence from one reference annotation could be annotated in another. Furthermore, relationships to nearby or overlapping annotated transcripts are even more complicated when using different genome assemblies. To better understand these problems, we surveyed current and previous versions of genomic assemblies and annotations across a number of public databases containing long noncoding RNA. We identified numerous discrepancies of transcripts regarding their genomic locations, transcript lengths and identifiers. Further investigation showed that the positional differences between reference annotations of essentially the same transcript could lead to differences in its measured expression at the RNA level. To aid in resolving these problems, we present the algorithm 'Universal Genomic Accession Hash (UGAHash)' and created an open source web tool to encourage the usage of the UGAHash algorithm. The UGAHash web tool (http://ugahash.uni-frankfurt.de) can be accessed freely without registration. The web tool allows researchers to generate Universal Genomic Accessions for genomic features or to explore annotations deposited in the public databases of the past and present versions.

The first step in modeling of these mechanisms, which can provide a guide to experimentation, is the generation of a list of model components. We have curated a list of proteins expressed in the rat renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) from proteomic data from 18 different publications. The database has been posted as a public resource at https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/IMCD_Proteome_Database/. It includes 8956 different proteins. To search the IMCD Proteomic Database efficiently, we have created a Java-based program called curated database Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (cdbBLAST), which uses the NCBI BLAST kernel to search for specific amino acid sequences corresponding to proteins in the database. cdbBLAST reports information on the matched protein and identifies proteins in the database that have similar sequences. We have also adapted cdbBLAST to interrogate our previously published IMCD Transcriptome Database. We have made the cdbBLAST program available for use either as a web application or a downloadable .jar file at https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/cdbBLAST/.

21811802,Simple database to select promoters for plant transgenesis.,"The experiments with transgenic plants frequently demand selection of promoters providing appropriate transcription patterns. The set of promoters commonly used in vectors and genetic constructs is very limited, and these promoters provide only a few variants of gene expression patterns. Moreover, identical promoters in a complex construct can induce transgene silencing. This problem can be solved using a variety of plant gene promoters with experimentally verified characteristics.

21757462,A Grid-enabled web portal for NMR structure refinement with AMBER.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The typical workflow for NMR structure determination involves collecting thousands of conformational restraints, calculating a bundle of 20-40 conformers in agreement with them and refining the energetics of these conformers. The structure calculation step employs simulated annealing based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with very simplified force fields. The value of refining the calculated conformers using restrained MD (rMD) simulations with state-of-art force fields is documented. This refinement however presents various subtleties, from the proper formatting of conformational restraints to the definition of suitable protocols.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a web interface to set up and run calculations with the AMBER package, which we called AMPS-NMR (AMBER-based Portal Server for NMR structures). The interface allows the refinement of NMR structures through rMD. Some predefined protocols are provided for this purpose, which can be personalized; it is also possible to create an entirely new protocol. AMPS-NMR can handle various restraint types. Standard rMD refinement in explicit water of the structures of three different proteins are shown as examples. AMPS-NMR additionally includes a workspace for the user to store different calculations. As an ancillary service, a web interface to AnteChamber is available, enabling the calculation of force field parameters for organic molecules such as ligands in protein-ligand adducts.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AMPS-NMR is embedded within the NMR services of the WeNMR project and is available at http://py-enmr.cerm.unifi.it/access/index/amps-nmr; its use requires registration with a digital certificate.<h4>Contact</h4>ivanobertini@cerm.unifi.it<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,7.0,,,amps-nmr,8.9878055,ok,,,mps-nmr,v2,0.9878055,,True,False,False,,http://py-enmr.cerm.unifi.it/access/index/amps-nmr,http://py-enmr.cerm.unifi.it/access/index/amps-nmr,True,...services of the WeNMR project and is available at http://py-enmr.cerm.unifi.it/access/index/amps-nmr; its use requires registration with a digital cer...,1
29342232,Informational and linguistic analysis of large genomic sequence collections via efficient Hadoop cluster algorithms.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Information theoretic and compositional/linguistic analysis of genomes have a central role in bioinformatics, even more so since the associated methodologies are becoming very valuable also for epigenomic and meta-genomic studies. The kernel of those methods is based on the collection of k-mer statistics, i.e. how many times each k-mer in {A,C,G,T}k occurs in a DNA sequence. Although this problem is computationally very simple and efficiently solvable on a conventional computer, the sheer amount of data available now in applications demands to resort to parallel and distributed computing. Indeed, those type of algorithms have been developed to collect k-mer statistics in the realm of genome assembly. However, they are so specialized to this domain that they do not extend easily to the computation of informational and linguistic indices, concurrently on sets of genomes.<h4>Results</h4>Following the well-established approach in many disciplines, and with a growing success also in bioinformatics, to resort to MapReduce and Hadoop to deal with 'Big Data' problems, we present KCH, the first set of MapReduce algorithms able to perform concurrently informational and linguistic analysis of large collections of genomic sequences on a Hadoop cluster. The benchmarking of KCH that we provide indicates that it is quite effective and versatile. It is also competitive with respect to the parallel and distributed algorithms highly specialized to k-mer statistics collection for genome assembly problems. In conclusion, KCH is a much needed addition to the growing number of algorithms and tools that use MapReduce for bioinformatics core applications.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software, including instructions for running it over Amazon AWS, as well as the datasets are available at http://www.di-srv.unisa.it/KCH.<h4>Contact</h4>umberto.ferraro@uniroma1.it.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,4.0,,,kch,8.9763231,ok,,,,v2,0.9763231,,True,False,False,,http://www.di-srv.unisa.it/KCH,http://www.di-srv.unisa.it/KCH,True,"...zon AWS, as well as the datasets are available at http://www.di-srv.unisa.it/KCH.<h4>Contact</h4>umberto.ferraro@uniroma1.it.<h4>S...",1

21631914,Faster Smith-Waterman database searches with inter-sequence SIMD parallelisation.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment is more sensitive than heuristic methods for database searching, but also more time-consuming. The fastest approach to parallelisation with SIMD technology has previously been described by Farrar in 2007. The aim of this study was to explore whether further speed could be gained by other approaches to parallelisation.<h4>Results</h4>A faster approach and implementation is described and benchmarked. In the new tool SWIPE, residues from sixteen different database sequences are compared in parallel to one query residue. Using a 375 residue query sequence a speed of 106 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS) was achieved on a dual Intel Xeon X5650 six-core processor system, which is over six times more rapid than software based on Farrar's 'striped' approach. SWIPE was about 2.5 times faster when the programs used only a single thread. For shorter queries, the increase in speed was larger. SWIPE was about twice as fast as BLAST when using the BLOSUM50 score matrix, while BLAST was about twice as fast as SWIPE for the BLOSUM62 matrix. The software is designed for 64 bit Linux on processors with SSSE3. Source code is available from http://dna.uio.no/swipe/ under the GNU Affero General Public License.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Efficient parallelisation using SIMD on standard hardware makes it possible to run Smith-Waterman database searches more than six times faster than before. The approach described here could significantly widen the potential application of Smith-Waterman searches. Other applications that require optimal local alignment scores could also benefit from improved performance.",True,False,6.0,,,swipe,8.72531676,ok,,,,v2,0.72531676,,True,False,False,,http://dna.uio.no/swipe/,http://dna.uio.no/swipe/,True,...cessors with SSSE3.

32859947,A relational database to identify differentially expressed genes in the endometrium and endometriosis lesions.,"Endometriosis is a common inflammatory estrogen-dependent gynecological disorder, associated with pelvic pain and reduced fertility in women. Several aspects of this disorder and its cellular and molecular etiology remain unresolved. We have analyzed the global gene expression patterns in the endometrium, peritoneum and in endometriosis lesions of endometriosis patients and in the endometrium and peritoneum of healthy women. In this report, we present the EndometDB, an interactive web-based user interface for browsing the gene expression database of collected samples without the need for computational skills. The EndometDB incorporates the expression data from 115 patients and 53 controls, with over 24000 genes and clinical features, such as their age, disease stages, hormonal medication, menstrual cycle phase, and the different endometriosis lesion types. Using the web-tool, the end-user can easily generate various plot outputs and projections, including boxplots, and heatmaps and the generated outputs can be downloaded in pdf-format.Availability and implementationThe web-based user interface is implemented using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Plotly and R.

30356876,A Web Resource for Designing Subunit Vaccine Against Major Pathogenic Species of Bacteria.,"Evolution has led to the expansion of survival strategies in pathogens including bacteria and emergence of drug resistant strains proved to be a major global threat. Vaccination is a promising strategy to protect human population. Reverse vaccinology is a more robust vaccine development approach especially with the availability of large-scale sequencing data and rapidly dropping cost of the techniques for acquiring such data from various organisms. The present study implements an immunoinformatic approach for screening the possible antigenic proteins among various pathogenic bacteria to systemically arrive at epitope-based vaccine candidates against 14 pathogenic bacteria. Thousand four hundred and fifty nine virulence factors and Five hundred and forty six products of essential genes were appraised as target proteins to predict potential epitopes with potential to stimulate different arms of the immune system. To address the self-tolerance, self-epitopes were identified by mapping on 1000 human proteome and were removed. Our analysis revealed that 21proteins from 5 bacterial species were found as virulent as well as essential to their survival, proved to be most suitable vaccine target against these species. In addition to the prediction of MHC-II binders, B cell and T cell epitopes as well as adjuvants individually from proteins of all 14 bacterial species, a stringent criteria lead us to identify 252 unique epitopes, which are predicted to be T-cell epitopes, B-cell epitopes, MHC II binders and Vaccine Adjuvants. In order to provide service to scientific community, we developed a web server VacTarBac for designing of vaccines against above species of bacteria. This platform integrates a number of tools that includes visualization tools to present antigenicity/epitopes density on an antigenic sequence. These tools will help users to identify most promiscuous vaccine candidates in a pathogenic antigen.

22336709,Non-coding transcription characterization and annotation: a guide and web resource for non-coding RNA databases.,"Large-scale transcriptome projects have shown that the number of RNA transcripts not coding for proteins (non-coding RNAs) is much larger than previously recognized. High-throughput technologies, coupled with bioinformatics approaches, have produced increasing amounts of data, highlighting the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in biological processes. Data generated by these studies include diverse non-coding RNA classes from organisms of different kingdoms, which were obtained using different experimental and computational assays. This has led to a rapid increase of specialized RNA databases. The fast growth in the number of available databases makes integration of stored information a difficult task. We present here NRDR, a Non-coding RNA Databases Resource for information retrieval on ncRNA databases (www.ncrnadatabases.org). We performed a survey of 102 public databases on ncRNAs and we have introduced four categorizations to classify these databases and to help researchers quickly search and find the information they need: RNA family, information source, information content and available search mechanisms.

31819066,A global database of historic and real-time flood events based on social media.,"Early event detection and response can significantly reduce the societal impact of floods. Currently, early warning systems rely on gauges, radar data, models and informal local sources. However, the scope and reliability of these systems are limited. Recently, the use of social media for detecting disasters has shown promising results, especially for earthquakes. Here, we present a new database for detecting floods in real-time on a global scale using Twitter. The method was developed using 88 million tweets, from which we derived over 10,000 flood events (i.e., flooding occurring in a country or first order administrative subdivision) across 176 countries in 11 languages in just over four years. Using strict parameters, validation shows that approximately 90% of the events were correctly detected. In countries where the first official language is included, our algorithm detected 63% of events in NatCatSERVICE disaster database at admin 1 level. Moreover, a large number of flood events not included in NatCatSERVICE were detected.

23586394,Clever generation of rich SPARQL queries from annotated relational schema: application to Semantic Web Service creation for biological databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>In recent years, a large amount of ""-omics"" data have been produced. However, these data are stored in many different species-specific databases that are managed by different institutes and laboratories. Biologists often need to find and assemble data from disparate sources to perform certain analyses. Searching for these data and assembling them is a time-consuming task. The Semantic Web helps to facilitate interoperability across databases. A common approach involves the development of wrapper systems that map a relational database schema onto existing domain ontologies. However, few attempts have been made to automate the creation of such wrappers.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a framework, named BioSemantic, for the creation of Semantic Web Services that are applicable to relational biological databases. This framework makes use of both Semantic Web and Web Services technologies and can be divided into two main parts: (i) the generation and semi-automatic annotation of an RDF view; and (ii) the automatic generation of SPARQL queries and their integration into Semantic Web Services backbones. We have used our framework to integrate genomic data from different plant databases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BioSemantic is a framework that was designed to speed integration of relational databases. We present how it can be used to speed the development of Semantic Web Services for existing relational biological databases. Currently, it creates and annotates RDF views that enable the automatic generation of SPARQL queries. Web Services are also created and deployed automatically, and the semantic annotations of our Web Services are added automatically using SAWSDL attributes.

29106641,The MAR databases: development and implementation of databases specific for marine metagenomics.,"We introduce the marine databases; MarRef, MarDB and MarCat (https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/databases/), which are publicly available resources that promote marine research and innovation. These data resources, which have been implemented in the Marine Metagenomics Portal (MMP) (https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/), are collections of richly annotated and manually curated contextual (metadata) and sequence databases representing three tiers of accuracy. While MarRef is a database for completely sequenced marine prokaryotic genomes, which represent a marine prokaryote reference genome database, MarDB includes all incomplete sequenced prokaryotic genomes regardless level of completeness. The last database, MarCat, represents a gene (protein) catalog of uncultivable (and cultivable) marine genes and proteins derived from marine metagenomics samples. The first versions of MarRef and MarDB contain 612 and 3726 records, respectively. Each record is built up of 106 metadata fields including attributes for sampling, sequencing, assembly and annotation in addition to the organism and taxonomic information. Currently, MarCat contains 1227 records with 55 metadata fields. Ontologies and controlled vocabularies are used in the contextual databases to enhance consistency.

21974739,New resources for functional analysis of omics data for the genus Aspergillus.,"<h4>Background</h4>Detailed and comprehensive genome annotation can be considered a prerequisite for effective analysis and interpretation of omics data. As such, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation has become a well accepted framework for functional annotation. The genus Aspergillus comprises fungal species that are important model organisms, plant and human pathogens as well as industrial workhorses. However, GO annotation based on both computational predictions and extended manual curation has so far only been available for one of its species, namely A. nidulans.<h4>Results</h4>Based on protein homology, we mapped 97% of the 3,498 GO annotated A. nidulans genes to at least one of seven other Aspergillus species: A. niger, A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. clavatus, A. terreus, A. oryzae and Neosartorya fischeri. GO annotation files compatible with diverse publicly available tools have been generated and deposited online. To further improve their accessibility, we developed a web application for GO enrichment analysis named FetGOat and integrated GO annotations for all Aspergillus species with public genome sequences. Both the annotation files and the web application FetGOat are accessible via the Broad Institute's website (http://www.broadinstitute.org/fetgoat/index.html). To demonstrate the value of those new resources for functional analysis of omics data for the genus Aspergillus, we performed two case studies analyzing microarray data recently published for A. nidulans, A. niger and A. oryzae.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We mapped A. nidulans GO annotation to seven other Aspergilli. By depositing the newly mapped GO annotation online as well as integrating it into the web tool FetGOat, we provide new, valuable and easily accessible resources for omics data analysis and interpretation for the genus Aspergillus.

32579606,An interactive database for the investigation of high-density peptide microarray guided interaction patterns and antivenom cross-reactivity.,"Snakebite envenoming is a major neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people every year. The only effective treatment against snakebite envenoming consists of unspecified cocktails of polyclonal antibodies purified from the plasma of immunized production animals. Currently, little data exists on the molecular interactions between venom-toxin epitopes and antivenom-antibody paratopes. To address this issue, high-density peptide microarray (hdpm) technology has recently been adapted to the field of toxinology. However, analysis of such valuable datasets requires expert understanding and, thus, complicates its broad application within the field. In the present study, we developed a user-friendly, and high-throughput web application named ""Snake Toxin and Antivenom Binding Profiles"" (STAB Profiles), to allow straight-forward analysis of hdpm datasets. To test our tool and evaluate its performance with a large dataset, we conducted hdpm assays using all African snake toxin protein sequences available in the UniProt database at the time of study design, together with eight commercial antivenoms in clinical use in Africa, thus representing the largest venom-antivenom dataset to date. Furthermore, we introduced a novel method for evaluating raw signals from a peptide microarray experiment and a data normalization protocol enabling intra-microarray and even inter-microarray chip comparisons. Finally, these data, alongside all the data from previous similar studies by Engmark et al., were preprocessed according to our newly developed protocol and made publicly available for download through the STAB Profiles web application (http://tropicalpharmacology.com/tools/stab-profiles/). With these data and our tool, we were able to gain key insights into toxin-antivenom interactions and were able to differentiate the ability of different antivenoms to interact with certain toxins of interest. The data, as well as the web application, we present in this article should be of significant value to the venom-antivenom research community.

Firstly, we predicted and identified experimentally validated epitopes in each of the antigens/proteins of the five known ebolaviruses. Secondly, we generated all the possible overlapping 9mer peptides from the proteins of ebolaviruses. Thirdly, conserved peptides across all the five ebolaviruses (four human pathogenic species) with no identical sequence in the human proteome, based on 1000 Genomes project, were identified. Finally, we identified peptide or epitope-based vaccine candidates that could activate both the B- and T-cell arms of the immune system. In addition, we also identified efficacious siRNAs against the mRNA transcriptome (absent in human transcriptome) of all the five ebolaviruses. It was observed that three species can potentially be targeted by a single siRNA (19mer) and 75 siRNAs can potentially target at least two species.

Several tools to ascertain TP53 mutations are also available for download. We have developed TP53MULTLoad, a manually curated database providing comprehensive details on the properties of 2549 missense TP53 mutants. More than 100,000 entries have been arranged in 39 different activity fields, such as change of transactivation on various promoters, apoptosis or growth arrest. For several hot spot mutants, multiple gain of function activities are also included.

28859252,Open access database of raw ultrasonic signals acquired from malignant and benign breast lesions.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The aim of this paper is to provide access to a database consisting of the raw radio-frequency ultrasonic echoes acquired from malignant and benign breast lesions. The database is freely available for study and signal analysis.<h4>Acquisition and validation methods</h4>The ultrasonic radio-frequency echoes were recorded from breast focal lesions of patients of the Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. The data were collected between 11/2013 and 10/2015. Patients were examined by a radiologist with 18 yr' experience in the ultrasonic examination of breast lesions. The set of data includes scans from 52 malignant and 48 benign breast lesions recorded in a group of 78 women. For each lesion, two individual orthogonal scans from the pathological region were acquired with the Ultrasonix SonixTouch Research ultrasound scanner using the L14-5/38 linear array transducer. All malignant lesions were histologically assessed by core needle biopsy. In the case of benign lesions, part of them was histologically assessed and another part was observed over a 2-year period.<h4>Data format and usage notes</h4>The radio-frequency echoes were stored in Matlab file format. For each scan, the region of interest was provided to correctly indicate the lesion area. Moreover, for each lesion, the BI-RADS category and the lesion class were included. Two code examples of data manipulation are presented. The data can be downloaded via the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.545928) or the website http://bluebox.ippt.gov.pl/~hpiotrzk.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The database can be used to test quantitative ultrasound techniques and ultrasound image processing algorithms, or to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems.",True,False,4.0,,,zenodo,6.9883208,ok,,,,v2,0.9883208,,True,False,False,,http://bluebox.ippt.gov.pl/~hpiotrzk,http://bluebox.ippt.gov.pl/~hpiotrzk,True,...s://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.545928) or the website http://bluebox.ippt.gov.pl/~hpiotrzk.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The database can b...,1
22120205,Using text mining to link journal articles to neuroanatomical databases.,"The electronic linking of neuroscience information, including data embedded in the primary literature, would permit powerful queries and analyses driven by structured databases. This task would be facilitated by automated procedures that can identify biological concepts in journals. Here we apply an approach for automatically mapping formal identifiers of neuroanatomical regions to text found in journal abstracts, applying it to a large body of abstracts from the Journal of Comparative Neurology (JCN). The analyses yield over 100,000 brain region mentions, which we map to 8,225 brain region concepts in multiple organisms. Based on the analysis of a manually annotated corpus, we estimate mentions are mapped at 95% precision and 63% recall. Our results provide insights into the patterns of publication on brain regions and species of study in JCN but also point to important challenges in the standardization of neuroanatomical nomenclatures. We find that many terms in the formal terminologies never appear in a JCN abstract, and, conversely, many terms that authors use are not reflected in the terminologies. To improve the terminologies, we deposited 136 unrecognized brain regions into the Neuroscience Lexicon (NeuroLex).

In parallel, concern is increasing about the proliferation of unregulated stem cell treatments worldwide. Regulated clinical testing is a de facto standard to establish the safety and efficacy of new cell therapies, yet reliable information on clinical studies involving hPSCs is scattered. Our analysis of a multitude of resources found 54 clinical studies involving several types of hPSCs, which are performed in ten countries. While the majority of those studies is based on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), clinical studies involving human induced pluripotent stem cells increased more strongly in the past 2 years than the number of hESC-based studies.

The decoys generated for each complex in the benchmark thoroughly cover the binding site and also contain a certain number of near-native binding modes. A few scoring functions have been evaluated using the ligand binding decoy sets for their abilities of predicting near-native binding modes. Among them, ITScore achieved a success rate of 86.7% for the rigid-ligand decoys and 79.7% for the flexible-ligand decoys, under the common definition of a successful prediction as root-mean-square deviation <2.0 Å from the native structure if the top-scored binding mode was considered.

25520705,Genetic resources for methane production from biomass described with the Gene Ontology.,"Methane (CH4) is a valuable fuel, constituting 70-95% of natural gas, and a potent greenhouse gas. Release of CH4 into the atmosphere contributes to climate change. Biological CH4 production or methanogenesis is mostly performed by methanogens, a group of strictly anaerobic archaea. The direct substrates for methanogenesis are H2 plus CO2, acetate, formate, methylamines, methanol, methyl sulfides, and ethanol or a secondary alcohol plus CO2. In numerous anaerobic niches in nature, methanogenesis facilitates mineralization of complex biopolymers such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins generated by primary producers. Thus, methanogens are critical players in the global carbon cycle. The same process is used in anaerobic treatment of municipal, industrial and agricultural wastes, reducing the biological pollutants in the wastes and generating methane. It also holds potential for commercial production of natural gas from renewable resources. This process operates in digestive systems of many animals, including cattle, and humans. In contrast, in deep-sea hydrothermal vents methanogenesis is a primary production process, allowing chemosynthesis of biomaterials from H2 plus CO2. In this report we present Gene Ontology (GO) terms that can be used to describe processes, functions and cellular components involved in methanogenic biodegradation and biosynthesis of specialized coenzymes that methanogens use. Some of these GO terms were previously available and the rest were generated in our Microbial Energy Gene Ontology (MENGO) project. A recently discovered non-canonical CH4 production process is also described. We have performed manual GO annotation of selected methanogenesis genes, based on experimental evidence, providing ""gold standards"" for machine annotation and automated discovery of methanogenesis genes or systems in diverse genomes.

30465691,Database establishment for the secondary fungal DNA barcode <i>translational elongation factor 1α</i> (<i>TEF1α</i>) <sup>1</sup>.,"With new or emerging fungal infections, human and animal fungal pathogens are a growing threat worldwide. Current diagnostic tools are slow, non-specific at the species and subspecies levels, and require specific morphological expertise to accurately identify pathogens from pure cultures. DNA barcodes are easily amplified, universal, short species-specific DNA sequences, which enable rapid identification by comparison with a well-curated reference sequence collection. The primary fungal DNA barcode, ITS region, was introduced in 2012 and is now routinely used in diagnostic laboratories. However, the ITS region only accurately identifies around 75% of all medically relevant fungal species, which has prompted the development of a secondary barcode to increase the resolution power and suitability of DNA barcoding for fungal disease diagnostics. The translational elongation factor 1α (<i>TEF1α</i>) was selected in 2015 as a secondary fungal DNA barcode, but it has not been implemented into practice, due to the absence of a reference database.

The first dataset (further referred to as the INBO dataset - http://doi.org/10.15468/njgbmh) contains 761,660 records of 70 species and is compiled by the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) in cooperation with the Butterfly working group of Natuurpunt (Vlinderwerkgroep). It is derived from the database Vlinderdatabank at the INBO, which consists of (historical) collection and literature data (1830-2001), for which all butterfly specimens in institutional and available personal collections were digitized and all entomological and other relevant publications were checked for butterfly distribution data. It also contains observations and monitoring data for the period 1991-2014.

23061897,"Sifting through genomes with iterative-sequence clustering produces a large, phylogenetically diverse protein-family resource.","<h4>Background</h4>New computational resources are needed to manage the increasing volume of biological data from genome sequencing projects. One fundamental challenge is the ability to maintain a complete and current catalog of protein diversity. We developed a new approach for the identification of protein families that focuses on the rapid discovery of homologous protein sequences.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented fully automated and high-throughput procedures to de novo cluster proteins into families based upon global alignment similarity. Our approach employs an iterative clustering strategy in which homologs of known families are sifted out of the search for new families. The resulting reduction in computational complexity enables us to rapidly identify novel protein families found in new genomes and to perform efficient, automated updates that keep pace with genome sequencing. We refer to protein families identified through this approach as ""Sifting Families,"" or SFams. Our analysis of ~10.5 million protein sequences from 2,928 genomes identified 436,360 SFams, many of which are not represented in other protein family databases. We validated the quality of SFam clustering through statistical as well as network topology-based analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We describe the rapid identification of SFams and demonstrate how they can be used to annotate genomes and metagenomes.

23812995,Compressive genomics for protein databases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The exponential growth of protein sequence databases has increasingly made the fundamental question of searching for homologs a computational bottleneck. The amount of unique data, however, is not growing nearly as fast; we can exploit this fact to greatly accelerate homology search. Acceleration of programs in the popular PSI/DELTA-BLAST family of tools will not only speed-up homology search directly but also the huge collection of other current programs that primarily interact with large protein databases via precisely these tools.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a suite of homology search tools, powered by compressively accelerated protein BLAST (CaBLASTP), which are significantly faster than and comparably accurate with all known state-of-the-art tools, including HHblits, DELTA-BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Further, our tools are implemented in a manner that allows direct substitution into existing analysis pipelines. The key idea is that we introduce a local similarity-based compression scheme that allows us to operate directly on the compressed data. Importantly, CaBLASTP's runtime scales almost linearly in the amount of unique data, as opposed to current BLASTP variants, which scale linearly in the size of the full protein database being searched. Our compressive algorithms will speed-up many tasks, such as protein structure prediction and orthology mapping, which rely heavily on homology search.<h4>Availability</h4>CaBLASTP is available under the GNU Public License at http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>bab@mit.edu.",True,False,4.0,,ablastp,,6.95564044,ok,,,,v2,0.95564044,,True,False,False,,http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/,http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/,True,...ASTP is available under the GNU Public License at http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>bab@mit.edu.,1

The search was performed for full-length NS3 protease, NS5A and NS5B polymerase sequences of HCV, separated by genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and 3a, and resulted in 798 NS3, 708 NS5A and 535 NS5B sequences from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and 3a, after the exclusion of sequences containing errors and/or gaps or incomplete sequences, and sequences from patients previously treated with direct antiviral agents (DAA). The sequence alignment was performed with MEGA 6.06 MAC and the resulting protein sequences were then analyzed using the BioEdit 7.2.5. for mutations associated with resistance. Only positions that have been described as being associated with failure in treatment in <i>in vivo</i> studies, and/or as conferring a more than 2-fold change in replication in comparison to the wildtype reference strain in <i>in vitro</i> phenotypic assays were included in the analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The Q80K variant in the <i>NS3</i> gene was the most prevalent mutation, being found in 44.66% of subtype 1a and 0.25% of subtype 1b. Other frequent mutations observed in more than 2% of the NS3 sequences were: I170V (3.21%) in genotype 1a, and Y56F (15.93%), V132I (23.28%) and I170V (65.20%) in genotype 1b.

26423616,Semantic biomedical resource discovery: a Natural Language Processing framework.,"<h4>Background</h4>A plethora of publicly available biomedical resources do currently exist and are constantly increasing at a fast rate. In parallel, specialized repositories are been developed, indexing numerous clinical and biomedical tools. The main drawback of such repositories is the difficulty in locating appropriate resources for a clinical or biomedical decision task, especially for non-Information Technology expert users. In parallel, although NLP research in the clinical domain has been active since the 1960s, progress in the development of NLP applications has been slow and lags behind progress in the general NLP domain. The aim of the present study is to investigate the use of semantics for biomedical resources annotation with domain specific ontologies and exploit Natural Language Processing methods in empowering the non-Information Technology expert users to efficiently search for biomedical resources using natural language.<h4>Methods</h4>A Natural Language Processing engine which can ""translate"" free text into targeted queries, automatically transforming a clinical research question into a request description that contains only terms of ontologies, has been implemented. The implementation is based on information extraction techniques for text in natural language, guided by integrated ontologies. Furthermore, knowledge from robust text mining methods has been incorporated to map descriptions into suitable domain ontologies in order to ensure that the biomedical resources descriptions are domain oriented and enhance the accuracy of services discovery. The framework is freely available as a web application at ( http://calchas.ics.forth.gr/ ).<h4>Results</h4>For our experiments, a range of clinical questions were established based on descriptions of clinical trials from the ClinicalTrials.gov registry as well as recommendations from clinicians. Domain experts manually identified the available tools in a tools repository which are suitable for addressing the clinical questions at hand, either individually or as a set of tools forming a computational pipeline. The results were compared with those obtained from an automated discovery of candidate biomedical tools. For the evaluation of the results, precision and recall measurements were used. Our results indicate that the proposed framework has a high precision and low recall, implying that the system returns essentially more relevant results than irrelevant.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There are adequate biomedical ontologies already available, sufficiency of existing NLP tools and quality of biomedical annotation systems for the implementation of a biomedical resources discovery framework, based on the semantic annotation of resources and the use on NLP techniques.

Its genome assembly was recently improved but the gene annotation was not updated. Here, we improved the Ae. arabicum gene annotation using 294 RNA-seq libraries and 136 307 full-length PacBio Iso-seq transcripts, increasing BUSCO completeness by 11.6% and featuring 5606 additional genes. Analysis of orthologs showed a lower number of genes in Ae. arabicum than in other Brassicaceae, which could be partially explained by loss of homeologs derived from the At-α polyploidization event and by a lower occurrence of tandem duplications after divergence of Aethionema from the other Brassicaceae. Benchmarking of MADS-box genes identified orthologs of FUL and AGL79 not found in previous versions. Analysis of full-length transcripts related to ABA-mediated seed dormancy discovered a conserved isoform of PIF6-β and antisense transcripts in ABI3, ABI4 and DOG1, among other cases found of different alternative splicing between Turkey and Cyprus ecotypes. The presented data allow alternative splicing mining and proposition of numerous hypotheses to research evolution and functional genomics.

28918286,Identifying combinatorial biomarkers by association rule mining in the CAMD Alzheimer's database.,"The concept of combinatorial biomarkers was conceived when it was noticed that simple biomarkers are often inadequate for recognizing and characterizing complex diseases. Here we present an algorithmic search method for complex biomarkers which may predict or indicate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other kinds of dementia. We show that our method is universal since it can describe any Boolean function for biomarker discovery. We applied data mining techniques that are capable to uncover implication-like logical schemes with detailed quality scoring. The new SCARF program was applied for the Tucson, Arizona based Critical Path Institute's CAMD database, containing laboratory and cognitive test data for 5821 patients from the placebo arm of clinical trials of large pharmaceutical companies, and consequently, the data is much more reliable than numerous other databases for dementia. The results of our study on this larger than 5800-patient cohort suggest beneficial effects of high B12 vitamin level, negative effects of high sodium levels or high AST (aspartate aminotransferase) liver enzyme levels to cognition. As an example for a more complex and quite surprising rule: Low or normal blood glucose level with either low cholesterol or high serum sodium would also increase the probability of bad cognition with a 3.7 multiplier.

30846902,An online global database of Hemiptera-Phytoplasma-Plant biological interactions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Phytoplasmas are phloem-limited plant pathogenic bacteria in the class Mollicutes transmitted by sap-feeding insect vectors of the Order Hemiptera. Vectors still have not yet been identified for about half of the 33 known phytoplasma groups and this has greatly hindered efforts to control the spread of diseases affecting important crops. Extensive gaps of knowledge on actual phytoplasma vectors and on the plant disease epidemiology prevent our understanding of the basic underlying biological mechanisms that facilitate interactions between insects, phytoplasmas and their host plants.<h4>New information</h4>This paper presents a complete online database of Hemiptera-Phytoplasma-Plant (HPP) biological interactions worldwide, searchable via an online interface. The raw data are available through Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2532738. The online database search interface was created using the 3I software (Dmitriev 2006) which enhances data usability by providing a customised web interface (http://trivellone.speciesfile.org/) that provides an overview of the recorded biological interactions and ability to discover particular interactions by searching for one or more phytoplasma, insect or plant taxa.

32383740,The cell line A-to-I RNA editing catalogue.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a common post transcriptional modification. It has a critical role in protecting against false activation of innate immunity by endogenous double stranded RNAs and has been associated with various regulatory processes and diseases such as autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases as well as cancer. In addition, the endogenous A-to-I editing machinery has been recently harnessed for RNA engineering. The study of RNA editing in humans relies heavily on the usage of cell lines as an important and commonly-used research tool. In particular, manipulations of the editing enzymes and their targets are often developed using cell line platforms. However, RNA editing in cell lines behaves very differently than in normal and diseased tissues, and most cell lines exhibit low editing levels, requiring over-expression of the enzymes. Here, we explore the A-to-I RNA editing landscape across over 1000 human cell lines types and show that for almost every editing target of interest a suitable cell line that mimics normal tissue condition may be found.

22303453,Catalog of microRNA seed polymorphisms in vertebrates.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA that plays an important role in posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA. Evidence has shown that miRNA gene variability might interfere with its function resulting in phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. A major role in miRNA target recognition is ascribed to complementarity with the miRNA seed region that can be affected by polymorphisms. In the present study, we developed an online tool for the detection of miRNA polymorphisms (miRNA SNiPer) in vertebrates (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer) and generated a catalog of miRNA seed region polymorphisms (miR-seed-SNPs) consisting of 149 SNPs in six species. Although a majority of detected polymorphisms were due to point mutations, two consecutive nucleotide substitutions (double nucleotide polymorphisms, DNPs) were also identified in nine miRNAs. We determined that miR-SNPs are frequently located within the quantitative trait loci (QTL), chromosome fragile sites, and cancer susceptibility loci, indicating their potential role in the genetic control of various complex traits. To test this further, we performed an association analysis between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP rs30372501, which is polymorphic in a large number of standard inbred strains, and all phenotypic traits in these strains deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database. Analysis showed a significant association between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP and a diverse array of traits including behavior, blood-clinical chemistry, body weight size and growth, and immune system suggesting that seed SNPs can indeed have major pleiotropic effects. The bioinformatics analyses, data and tools developed in the present study can serve researchers as a starting point in testing more targeted hypotheses and designing experiments using optimal species or strains for further mechanistic studies.",True,False,4.0,,,sniper,6.77914524,ok,,mouse phenome database,,v2,0.77914524,,True,False,False,,http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer,http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer,True,...iRNA polymorphisms (miRNA SNiPer) in vertebrates (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer) and generated a catalog of miRNA seed region pol...,1
23803311,Consensus and conflict cards for metabolic pathway databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>The metabolic network of H. sapiens and many other organisms is described in multiple pathway databases. The level of agreement between these descriptions, however, has proven to be low. We can use these different descriptions to our advantage by identifying conflicting information and combining their knowledge into a single, more accurate, and more complete description. This task is, however, far from trivial.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce the concept of Consensus and Conflict Cards (C₂Cards) to provide concise overviews of what the databases do or do not agree on. Each card is centered at a single gene, EC number or reaction. These three complementary perspectives make it possible to distinguish disagreements on the underlying biology of a metabolic process from differences that can be explained by different decisions on how and in what detail to represent knowledge. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented C₂Cards(Human), as a web application http://www.molgenis.org/c2cards, covering five human pathway databases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>C₂Cards can contribute to ongoing reconciliation efforts by simplifying the identification of consensus and conflicts between pathway databases and lowering the threshold for experts to contribute. Several case studies illustrate the potential of the C₂Cards in identifying disagreements on the underlying biology of a metabolic process. The overviews may also point out controversial biological knowledge that should be subject of further research.

30157169,"New methods for computational decomposition of whole-mount in situ images enable effective curation of a large, highly redundant collection of Xenopus images.","The precise anatomical location of gene expression is an essential component of the study of gene function. For most model organisms this task is usually undertaken via visual inspection of gene expression images by interested researchers. Computational analysis of gene expression has been developed in several model organisms, notably in Drosophila which exhibits a uniform shape and outline in the early stages of development. Here we address the challenge of computational analysis of gene expression in Xenopus, where the range of developmental stages of interest encompasses a wide range of embryo size and shape. Embryos may have different orientation across images, and, in addition, embryos have a pigmented epidermis that can mask or confuse underlying gene expression. Here we report the development of a set of computational tools capable of processing large image sets with variable characteristics. These tools efficiently separate the Xenopus embryo from the background, separately identify both histochemically stained and naturally pigmented regions within the embryo, and can sort images from the same gene and developmental stage according to similarity of gene expression patterns without information about relative orientation. We tested these methods on a large, but highly redundant, collection of 33,289 in situ hybridization images, allowing us to select representative images of expression patterns at different embryo orientations. This has allowed us to put a much smaller subset of these images into the public domain in an effective manner.

34673265,A GO catalogue of human DNA-binding transcription factors.,"To control gene transcription, DNA-binding transcription factors recognise specific sequence motifs in gene regulatory regions. A complete and reliable GO annotation of all DNA-binding transcription factors is key to investigating the delicate balance of gene regulation in response to environmental and developmental stimuli. The need for such information is demonstrated by the many lists of transcription factors that have been produced over the past decade. The COST Action Gene Regulation Ensemble Effort for the Knowledge Commons (GREEKC) Consortium brought together experts in the field of transcription with the aim of providing high quality and interoperable gene regulatory data. The Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium provides strict definitions for gene product function, including factors that regulate transcription. The collaboration between the GREEKC and GO Consortia has enabled the application of those definitions to produce a new curated catalogue of over 1400 human DNA-binding transcription factors, that can be accessed at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/targetset/dbTF.

These analyses require a reformulation of how to organize multi-species datasets and visualize comparative genomics data analyses results. Recently, we developed a method, multi-species cMonkey, which integrates heterogeneous high-throughput datatypes from multiple species to identify conserved regulatory modules. Here we present an integrated data visualization system, built upon the Gaggle, enabling exploration of our method's results (available at http://meatwad.bio.nyu.edu/cmmr.html). The system can also be used to explore other comparative genomics datasets and outputs from other data analysis procedures - results from other multiple-species clustering programs or from independent clustering of different single-species datasets. We provide an example use of our system for two bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium.

26315263,Development of a D genome specific marker resource for diploid and hexaploid wheat.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mapping and map-based cloning of genes that control agriculturally and economically important traits remain great challenges for plants with complex highly repetitive genomes such as those within the grass tribe, Triticeae. Mapping limitations in the Triticeae are primarily due to low frequencies of polymorphic gene markers and poor genetic recombination in certain genetic regions. Although the abundance of repetitive sequence may pose common problems in genome analysis and sequence assembly of large and complex genomes, they provide repeat junction markers with random and unbiased distribution throughout chromosomes. Hence, development of a high-throughput mapping technology that combine both gene-based and repeat junction-based markers is needed to generate maps that have better coverage of the entire genome.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, the available genomics resource of the diploid Aegilop tauschii, the D genome donor of bread wheat, were used to develop genome specific markers that can be applied for mapping in modern hexaploid wheat. A NimbleGen array containing both gene-based and repeat junction probe sequences derived from Ae. tauschii was developed and used to map the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and deletion bin lines of the D genome chromosomes. Based on these mapping data, we have now anchored 5,171 repeat junction probes and 10,892 gene probes, corresponding to 5,070 gene markers, to the delineated deletion bins of the D genome. The order of the gene-based markers within the deletion bins of the Chinese Spring can be inferred based on their positions on the Ae. tauschii genetic map. Analysis of the probe sequences against the Chinese Spring chromosome sequence assembly database facilitated mapping of the NimbleGen probes to the sequence contigs and allowed assignment or ordering of these sequence contigs within the deletion bins. The accumulated length of anchored sequence contigs is about 155 Mb, representing ~ 3.2 % of the D genome. A specific database was developed to allow user to search or BLAST against the probe sequence information and to directly download PCR primers for mapping specific genetic loci.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In bread wheat, aneuploid stocks have been extensively used to assign markers linked with genes/traits to chromosomes, chromosome arms, and their specific bins. Through this study, we added thousands of markers to the existing wheat chromosome bin map, representing a significant step forward in providing a resource to navigate the wheat genome.

23404398,A genetic resource for rapid and comprehensive phenotype screening of nonessential Staphylococcus aureus genes.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>To enhance the research capabilities of investigators interested in Staphylococcus aureus, the Nebraska Center for Staphylococcal Research (CSR) has generated a sequence-defined transposon mutant library consisting of 1,952 strains, each containing a single mutation within a nonessential gene of the epidemic community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) isolate USA300. To demonstrate the utility of this library for large-scale screening of phenotypic alterations, we spotted the library on indicator plates to assess hemolytic potential, protease production, pigmentation, and mannitol utilization. As expected, we identified many genes known to function in these processes, thus validating the utility of this approach. Importantly, we also identified genes not previously associated with these phenotypes. In total, 71 mutants displayed differential hemolysis activities, the majority of which were not previously known to influence hemolysin production. Furthermore, 62 mutants were defective in protease activity, with only 14 previously demonstrated to be involved in the production of extracellular proteases. In addition, 38 mutations affected pigment formation, while only 7 influenced mannitol fermentation, underscoring the sensitivity of this approach to identify rare phenotypes. Finally, 579 open reading frames were not interrupted by a transposon, thus providing potentially new essential gene targets for subsequent antibacterial discovery. Overall, the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library represents a valuable new resource for the research community that should greatly enhance investigations of this important human pathogen.<h4>Importance</h4>Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus cause significant morbidity and mortality in both community and hospital environments. Specific-allelic-replacement mutants are required to study the biology of this organism; however, this process is costly and time-consuming. We describe the construction and validation of a sequence-defined transposon mutant library available for use by the scientific community through the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA) strain repository. In addition, complementary resources, including a website (http://app1.unmc.edu/fgx/) and genetic tools that expedite the allelic replacement of the transposon in the mutants with useful selectable markers and fluorescent reporter fusions, have been generated.

Several knowledge-based methods have been developed for the prediction of PFSs; however, accurate methods for predicting the physicochemical interactions associated with PFSs are still lacking.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we present a sequence-based method for the prediction of physicochemical interactions at PFSs. The method is based on a functional site and physicochemical interaction-annotated domain profile database, called fiDPD, which was built using protein domains found in the Protein Data Bank. This method was applied to 13 target proteins from the very recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP10/11), and our calculations gave a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.66 for PFS prediction and an 80% recall in the prediction of the associated physicochemical interactions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that, in addition to the PFSs, the physical interactions at these sites are also conserved in the evolution of proteins.

In an effort to validate and link variants from the medical genetics literature to an unambiguous reference for each variant, we developed a software pipeline and reviewed 68 641 single amino acid mutations from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and dbSNP. The frequency of unresolved mutation annotations varied widely among the databases, ranging from 4 to 23%. A taxonomy of primary causes for unresolved mutations was produced.<h4>Availability</h4>This program is freely available from the web site (http://safegene.hms.harvard.edu/aa2nt/).",True,False,5.0,,mendelian inheritance,,6.60294,ok,hgmd | human gene mutation database,online mendelian inheritance in man | human gene mutation database,omim | hgmd | dbsnp,v2,0.60294,Automated validation of genetic variants from large databases,True,False,False,,http://safegene.hms.harvard.edu/aa2nt/,http://safegene.hms.harvard.edu/aa2nt/,True,...is program is freely available from the web site (http://safegene.hms.harvard.edu/aa2nt/).,1
26391769,Genome-wide cataloging and analysis of alternatively spliced genes in cereal crops.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein functional diversity at the post-transcriptional level is regulated through spliceosome mediated pre-mRNA alternative splicing (AS) events and that has been widely demonstrated to be a key player in regulating the functional diversity in plants. Identification and analysis of AS genes in cereal crop plants are critical for crop improvement and understanding regulatory mechanisms.<h4>Results</h4>We carried out the comparative analyses of the functional landscapes of the AS using the consensus assembly of expressed sequence tags and available mRNA sequences in four cereal plants. We identified a total of 8,734 in Oryza sativa subspecies (ssp) japonica, 2,657 in O. sativa ssp indica, 3,971 in Sorghum bicolor, and 10,687 in Zea mays AS genes. Among the identified AS events, intron retention remains to be the dominant type accounting for 23.5 % in S. bicolor, and up to 55.8 % in O. sativa ssp indica. We identified a total of 887 AS genes that were conserved among Z. mays, S. bicolor, and O. sativa ssp japonica; and 248 AS genes were found to be conserved among all four studied species or ssp. Furthermore, we identified 53 AS genes conserved with Brachypodium distachyon. Gene Ontology classification of AS genes revealed functional assignment of these genes in many biological processes with diverse molecular functions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AS is common in cereal plants. The AS genes identified in four cereal crops in this work provide the foundation for further studying the roles of AS in regulation of cereal plant growth and development.

To shed further light into these mechanisms, a number of systems-scale studies have been conducted to measure transcriptional changes in blood leukocytes of either naturally or experimentally infected individuals, or in individual's post-vaccination. Here we are making available a public repository, for research investigators for interpretation, a collection of transcriptome datasets obtained from human whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to investigate the transcriptional responses following viral respiratory tract infection or vaccination against respiratory viruses. In total, Thirty one31 datasets, associated to viral respiratory tract infections and their related vaccination studies, were identified and retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and loaded in a custom web application designed for interactive query and visualization of integrated large-scale data.

The lexical and semantic variables in the database include frequency, regularity, familiarity, consistency, number of strokes, homophone density, semantic ambiguity rating, phonetic combinability, semantic combinability, and the number of disyllabic compound words formed by a character. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictive powers of these variables for the naming RTs. The results demonstrated that these variables could account for a significant portion of variance (55.8%) in the naming RTs. An additional multiple regression analysis was conducted to demonstrate the effects of consistency and character frequency. Overall, the regression results were consistent with the findings of previous studies on Chinese character naming. This database should be useful for research into Chinese language processing, Chinese education, or cross-linguistic comparisons.

21737439,The Cardiac Atlas Project--an imaging database for computational modeling and statistical atlases of the heart.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Integrative mathematical and statistical models of cardiac anatomy and physiology can play a vital role in understanding cardiac disease phenotype and planning therapeutic strategies. However, the accuracy and predictive power of such models is dependent upon the breadth and depth of noninvasive imaging datasets. The Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) has established a large-scale database of cardiac imaging examinations and associated clinical data in order to develop a shareable, web-accessible, structural and functional atlas of the normal and pathological heart for clinical, research and educational purposes. A goal of CAP is to facilitate collaborative statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion and characterize cardiac function among and within population groups.<h4>Results</h4>Three main open-source software components were developed: (i) a database with web-interface; (ii) a modeling client for 3D + time visualization and parametric description of shape and motion; and (iii) open data formats for semantic characterization of models and annotations. The database was implemented using a three-tier architecture utilizing MySQL, JBoss and Dcm4chee, in compliance with the DICOM standard to provide compatibility with existing clinical networks and devices. Parts of Dcm4chee were extended to access image specific attributes as search parameters. To date, approximately 3000 de-identified cardiac imaging examinations are available in the database.

Held at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, Paris, it currently comprises records for 5,400,000 specimens, representing 90% of the estimated total of specimens. Ninety nine percent of the specimen entries are linked to one or more images and 16% have field-collecting information available. This major botanical collection represents the results of over three centuries of exploration and study. The sources of the collection are global, with a strong representation for France, including overseas territories, and former French colonies. The compilation of this dataset was made possible through numerous national and international projects, the most important of which was linked to the renovation of the herbarium building. The vascular plant collection is actively expanding today, hence the continuous growth exhibited by the dataset, which can be fully accessed through the GBIF portal or the MNHN database portal (available at: https://science.mnhn.fr/institution/mnhn/collection/p/item/search/form).

28591841,RSAT matrix-clustering: dynamic exploration and redundancy reduction of transcription factor binding motif collections.,"Transcription factor (TF) databases contain multitudes of binding motifs (TFBMs) from various sources, from which non-redundant collections are derived by manual curation. The advent of high-throughput methods stimulated the production of novel collections with increasing numbers of motifs. Meta-databases, built by merging these collections, contain redundant versions, because available tools are not suited to automatically identify and explore biologically relevant clusters among thousands of motifs. Motif discovery from genome-scale data sets (e.g. ChIP-seq) also produces redundant motifs, hampering the interpretation of results. We present matrix-clustering, a versatile tool that clusters similar TFBMs into multiple trees, and automatically creates non-redundant TFBM collections. A feature unique to matrix-clustering is its dynamic visualisation of aligned TFBMs, and its capability to simultaneously treat multiple collections from various sources. We demonstrate that matrix-clustering considerably simplifies the interpretation of combined results from multiple motif discovery tools, and highlights biologically relevant variations of similar motifs. We also ran a large-scale application to cluster ∼11 000 motifs from 24 entire databases, showing that matrix-clustering correctly groups motifs belonging to the same TF families, and drastically reduced motif redundancy. matrix-clustering is integrated within the RSAT suite (http://rsat.eu/), accessible through a user-friendly web interface or command-line for its integration in pipelines.",True,False,5.0,,a large-scale,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,RSAT matrix-clustering,True,False,False,,http://rsat.eu/,http://rsat.eu/,True,"...x-clustering is integrated within the RSAT suite (http://rsat.eu/), accessible through a user-friendly web interfac...",1
26040196,A database for the taxonomic and phylogenetic identification of the genus Bradyrhizobium using multilocus sequence analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Biological nitrogen fixation, with an emphasis on the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, is a key process for agriculture and the environment, allowing the replacement of nitrogen fertilizers, reducing water pollution by nitrate as well as emission of greenhouse gases. Soils contain numerous strains belonging to the bacterial genus Bradyrhizobium, which establish symbioses with a variety of legumes. However, due to the high conservation of Bradyrhizobium 16S rRNA genes - considered as the backbone of the taxonomy of prokaryotes - few species have been delineated. The multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) methodology, which includes analysis of housekeeping genes, has been shown to be promising and powerful for defining bacterial species, and, in this study, it was applied to Bradyrhizobium, species, increasing our understanding of the diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria.<h4>Description</h4>Classification of bacteria of agronomic importance is relevant to biodiversity, as well as to biotechnological manipulation to improve agricultural productivity. We propose the construction of an online database that will provide information and tools using MLSA to improve phylogenetic and taxonomic characterization of Bradyrhizobium, allowing the comparison of genomic sequences with those of type and representative strains of each species.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A database for the taxonomic and phylogenetic identification of the Bradyrhizobium, genus, using MLSA, will facilitate the use of biological data available through an intuitive web interface. Sequences stored in the on-line database can be compared with multiple sequences of other strains with simplicity and agility through multiple alignment algorithms and computational routines integrated into the database. The proposed database and software tools are available at http://mlsa.cnpso.embrapa.br, and can be used, free of charge, by researchers worldwide to classify Bradyrhizobium, strains; the database and software can be applied to replicate the experiments presented in this study as well as to generate new experiments.

25159016,"Integrated approach using multistep enzyme digestion, TiO2 enrichment, and database search for in-depth phosphoproteomic profiling.","Protein phosphorylation is a major PTM that regulates important cell signaling mechanisms. In-depth phosphoproteomic analysis provides a method of examining this complex interplay, yielding a mechanistic understanding of the cellular processes and pathogenesis of various diseases. However, the analysis of protein phosphorylation is challenging, due to the low concentration of phosphoproteins in highly complex mixtures and the high variability of phosphorylation sites. Thus, typical phosphoproteome studies that are based on MS require large amounts of starting material and extensive fractionation steps to reduce the sample complexity. To this end, we present a simple strategy (integrated multistep enzyme digestion, enrichment, database search-iMEED) to improve coverage of the phosphoproteome from lower sample amounts which is faster than other commonly used approaches. It is inexpensive and adaptable to low sample amounts and saves time and effort with regard to sample preparation and mass spectrometric analysis, allowing samples to be prepared without prefractionation or specific instruments, such as HPLC.

34566452,A database and checklist of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) from Colombia.,"<h4>Background</h4>Molecular DNA sequence data allow unprecedented advances in biodiversity assessments, monitoring schemes and taxonomic works, particularly in poorly-explored areas. They allow, for instance, the sorting of material rapidly into operational taxonomic units (such as BINs - Barcode Index Numbers), sequences can be subject to diverse analyses and, with linked metadata and physical vouchers, they can be examined further by experts. However, a prerequisite for their exploitation is the construction of reference libraries of DNA sequences that represent the existing biodiversity. To achieve these goals for Geometridae (Lepidoptera) moths in Colombia, expeditions were carried out to 26 localities in the northern part of the country in 2015-2019. The aim was to collect specimens and sequence their DNA barcodes and to record a fraction of the species richness and occurrences in one of the most biodiversity-rich countries. These data are the beginning of an identification guide to Colombian geometrid moths, whose identities are currently often provisional only, being morpho species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Prior to the current dataset, 99 Geometridae sequences forming 44 BINs from Colombia were publicly available on the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), covering 20 species only.<h4>New information</h4>We enrich the Colombian Geometridae database significantly by including DNA barcodes, two nuclear markers, photos of vouchers and georeferenced occurrences of 281 specimens of geometrid moths from different localities. These specimens are classified into 80 genera. Analytical tools on BOLD clustered 157 of the mentioned sequences to existing BINs identified to species level, identified earlier by experts. Another 115 were assigned to BINs that were identified to genus or tribe level only. Eleven specimens did not match any existing BIN on BOLD and are, therefore, new additions to the database. It is likely that many BINs represent undescribed species. Nine short sequences (< 500bp) were not assigned to BINs, but identified to the lowest taxonomic category by expert taxonomists and with comparisons of type material photos. The released new genetic information will help to further progress the systematics of Geometridae. An illustrated catalogue of all new records allows validation of our identifications; it is also the first document of this kind for Colombian Geometridae. All specimens are deposited at the Museo de Zoología of Universidad de Sucre (MZUS), North Colombia. DNA BINs are reported in this study through dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-GEOCO, the species occurrences are available on SIB Colombia https://sibcolombia.net/ and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) https://www.gbif.org/ through https://doi.org/10.15472/ucfmkh.",True,False,3.0,,global biodiversity information facility,gbif,6.0,conflict,gbif | global biodiversity information facility,,,spacy,0.0,,True,False,False,,https://sibcolombia.net/ | https://www.gbif.org/ | http://www.gbif.org/,https://www.gbif.org/,True,...e Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) https://www.gbif.org/ through https://doi.org/10.15472/ucfmkh.,1

21791094,Bayesian semi-supervised classification of bacterial samples using MLST databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Worldwide effort on sampling and characterization of molecular variation within a large number of human and animal pathogens has lead to the emergence of multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) databases as an important tool for studying the epidemiology and evolution of pathogens. Many of these databases are currently harboring several thousands of multi-locus DNA sequence types (STs) enriched with metadata over traits such as serotype, antibiotic resistance, host organism etc of the isolates. Curators of the databases have thus the possibility of dividing the pathogen populations into subsets representing different evolutionary lineages, geographically associated groups, or other subpopulations, which are defined in terms of molecular similarities and dissimilarities residing within a database. When combined with the existing metadata, such subsets may provide invaluable information for assessing the position of a new set of isolates in relation to the whole pathogen population.<h4>Results</h4>To enable users of MLST schemes to query the databases with sets of new bacterial isolates and to automatically analyze their relation to existing curated sequences, we introduce here a Bayesian model-based method for semi-supervised classification of MLST data. Our method can use an MLST database as a training set and assign simultaneously any set of query sequences into the earlier discovered lineages/populations, while also allowing some or all of these sequences to form previously undiscovered genetically distinct groups. This tool provides probabilistic quantification of the classification uncertainty and is highly efficient computationally, thus enabling rapid analyses of large databases and sets of query sequences. The latter feature is a necessary prerequisite for an automated access through the MLST web interface. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by anayzing both real and synthesized data from MLST databases. The introduced method for semi-supervised classification of sets of query STs is freely available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux operative systems in BAPS 5.4 software which is downloadable at http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf/mate/jc/software/baps.html. The query functionality is also directly available for the Staphylococcus aureus database at http://www.mlst.net and shortly will be available for other species databases hosted at this web portal.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have introduced a model-based tool for automated semi-supervised classification of new pathogen samples that can be integrated into the web interface of the MLST databases.

27787817,Consensus Prediction of Charged Single Alpha-Helices with CSAHserver.,"Charged single alpha-helices (CSAHs) constitute a rare structural motif. CSAH is characterized by a high density of regularly alternating residues with positively and negatively charged side chains. Such segments exhibit unique structural properties; however, there are only a handful of proteins where its existence is experimentally verified. Therefore, establishing a pipeline that is capable of predicting the presence of CSAH segments with a low false positive rate is of considerable importance. Here we describe a consensus-based approach that relies on two conceptually different CSAH detection methods and a final filter based on the estimated helix-forming capabilities of the segments.

23986771,Construction of a rice glycoside hydrolase phylogenomic database and identification of targets for biofuel research.,"Glycoside hydrolases (GH) catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in cell wall polymers and can have major effects on cell wall architecture. Taking advantage of the massive datasets available in public databases, we have constructed a rice phylogenomic database of GHs (http://ricephylogenomics.ucdavis.edu/cellwalls/gh/). This database integrates multiple data types including the structural features, orthologous relationships, mutant availability, and gene expression patterns for each GH family in a phylogenomic context. The rice genome encodes 437 GH genes classified into 34 families. Based on pairwise comparison with eight dicot and four monocot genomes, we identified 138 GH genes that are highly diverged between monocots and dicots, 57 of which have diverged further in rice as compared with four monocot genomes scanned in this study. Chromosomal localization and expression analysis suggest a role for both whole-genome and localized gene duplications in expansion and diversification of GH families in rice. We examined the meta-profiles of expression patterns of GH genes in twenty different anatomical tissues of rice. Transcripts of 51 genes exhibit tissue or developmental stage-preferential expression, whereas, seventeen other genes preferentially accumulate in actively growing tissues. When queried in RiceNet, a probabilistic functional gene network that facilitates functional gene predictions, nine out of seventeen genes form a regulatory network with the well-characterized genes involved in biosynthesis of cell wall polymers including cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like genes of rice.

24249590,Great ape skeletal collections: making the most of scarce and irreplaceable resources in the digital age.,"Information about primate genomes has re-emphasized the importance of the great apes (Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo) as, for most purposes, the appropriate comparators when generating hypotheses about the most recent common ancestor of the hominins and panins, or the most recent common ancestor of the hominin clade. Great ape skeletal collections are thus an important and irreplaceable resource for researchers conducting these types of comparative analyses, yet the integrity of these collections is threatened by unnecessary use and their availability is threatened by financial pressures on the institutions in which the collections reside. We discuss the general history of great ape skeletal collections, and in order to get a better sense of the utility and potential of these important sources of data we assemble the equivalent of a biography of the Powell-Cotton Collection. We explore the history of how this collection of chimpanzee and gorilla skeletons was accumulated, how it came to be recognized as a potentially important source of comparative information, who has made use of it, and what types of data have been collected. We present a protocol for collecting information about each individual animal (e.g., which bones are preserved, their condition, etc.) and have made that information about the Powell-Cotton Collection freely available in an online relational database (Human Origins Database, www.humanoriginsdatabase.org). As an illustration of the practical application of these data, we developed a tabular summary of ontogenetic information about each individual (see Appendices A and B). Collections like the Powell-Cotton are irreplaceable sources of material regarding the hard-tissue evidence and recent history of the closest living relatives of modern humans. We end this contribution by suggesting ways that curators and the researchers who use and rely on these reference collections could work together to help preserve and protect them so that future generations can use and benefit from these priceless resources.",True,False,3.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,Great ape skeletal collections,True,False,False,,http://www.humanoriginsdatabase.org,http://www.humanoriginsdatabase.org,True,,1

27199454,Comprehensive database of human E3 ubiquitin ligases: application to aquaporin-2 regulation.,"Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) is regulated in part via vasopressin-mediated changes in protein half-life that are in turn dependent on AQP2 ubiquitination. Here we addressed the question, ""What E3 ubiquitin ligase is most likely to be responsible for AQP2 ubiquitination?"" using large-scale data integration based on Bayes' rule. The first step was to bioinformatically identify all E3 ligase genes coded by the human genome. The 377 E3 ubiquitin ligases identified in the human genome, consisting predominant of HECT, RING, and U-box proteins, have been used to create a publicly accessible and downloadable online database https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/KSBP2/Targets/Lists/E3-ligases/). We also curated a second database of E3 ligase accessory proteins that included BTB domain proteins, cullins, SOCS-box proteins, and F-box proteins. Using Bayes' theorem to integrate information from multiple large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, we ranked these 377 E3 ligases with respect to their probability of interaction with AQP2. Application of Bayes' rule identified the E3 ligases most likely to interact with AQP2 as (in order of probability): NEDD4 and NEDD4L (tied for first), AMFR, STUB1, ITCH, ZFPL1. Significantly, the two E3 ligases tied for top rank have also been studied extensively in the reductionist literature as regulatory proteins in renal tubule epithelia. The concordance of conclusions from reductionist and systems-level data provides strong motivation for further studies of the roles of NEDD4 and NEDD4L in the regulation of AQP2 protein turnover.",True,False,3.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,Comprehensive database of human E3 ubiquitin ligases,True,False,False,,https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/KSBP2/Targets/Lists/E3-ligases/,https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/KSBP2/Targets/Lists/E3-ligases/,True,...licly accessible and downloadable online database https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/Databases/KSBP2/Targets/Lists/E3-ligases/).

21990165,Classification of missense substitutions in the BRCA genes: a database dedicated to Ex-UVs.,"Unclassified sequence variants (UVs) arising from clinical mutation screening of cancer susceptibility genes present a frustrating issue to clinical genetics services and the patients that they serve. We created an open-access database holding missense substitutions from the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The main inclusion criterion is that each variant should have been assessed in a published work that used the Bayesian integrated evaluation of unclassified BRCA gene variants. Transfer of data on these substitutions from the original publications to our database afforded an opportunity to analyze the missense substitutions under a single model and to remove inconsistencies that arose during the evolution of the integrated evaluation over the last decade. This analysis also afforded the opportunity to reclassify these missense substitutions according to the recently published IARC 5-Class system. From an initial set of 248 missense substitutions, 31 were set aside due to nonnegligible probability to interfere with splicing. Of the remaining substitutions, 28 fell into one of the two pathogenic classes (IARC Class 4 or 5), 174 fell into one of the two nonpathogenic classes (IARC Class 1 or 2), and 15 remain in IARC Class 3, ""Uncertain.""

29855280,Antidepressants for depressive disorder in children and adolescents: a database of randomised controlled trials.,"<h4>Background</h4>In recent years, whether, when and how to use antidepressants to treat depressive disorder in children and adolescents has been hotly debated. Relevant evidence on this topic has increased rapidly. In this paper, we present the construction and content of a database of randomised controlled trials of antidepressants to treat depressive disorder in children and adolescents. This database can be freely accessed via our website and will be regularly updated.<h4>Description</h4>Major bibliographic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LiLACS), international trial registers and regulatory agencies' websites were systematically searched for published and unpublished studies up to April 30, 2017. We included randomised controlled trials in which the efficacy or tolerability of any oral antidepressant was compared with that of a control group or any other treatment. In total, 7377 citations from bibliographical databases and 3289 from international trial registers and regulatory agencies' websites were identified. Of these, 53 trials were eligible for inclusion in the final database. Selected data were extracted from each study, including characteristics of the participants (the study population, setting, diagnostic criteria, type of depression, age, sex, and comorbidity), characteristics of the treatment conditions (the treatment conditions, general information, and detail of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy) and study characteristics (the sponsor, country, number of sites, blinding method, sample size, treatment duration, depression scales, other scales, and primary outcome measure used, and side-effect monitoring method). Moreover, the risk of bias for each trial were assessed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This database provides information on nearly all randomised controlled trials of antidepressants in children and adolescents. By using this database, researchers can improve research efficiency, avoid inadvertent errors and easily focus on the targeted subgroups in which they are interested. For authors of subsequent reviews, they could only use this database to insure that they have completed a comprehensive review, rather than relied solely on the data from this database. We expect this database could help to promote research on evidence-based practice in the treatment of depressive disorder in children and adolescents.

29561359,Comparative transcriptome profiling of the human and mouse dorsal root ganglia: an RNA-seq-based resource for pain and sensory neuroscience research.,"Molecular neurobiological insight into human nervous tissues is needed to generate next-generation therapeutics for neurological disorders such as chronic pain. We obtained human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) samples from organ donors and performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the hDRG transcriptional landscape, systematically comparing it with publicly available data from a variety of human and orthologous mouse tissues, including mouse DRG (mDRG). We characterized the hDRG transcriptional profile in terms of tissue-restricted gene coexpression patterns and putative transcriptional regulators, and formulated an information-theoretic framework to quantify DRG enrichment. Relevant gene families and pathways were also analyzed, including transcription factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, and ion channels. Our analyses reveal an hDRG-enriched protein-coding gene set (∼140), some of which have not been described in the context of DRG or pain signaling. Most of these show conserved enrichment in mDRG and were mined for known drug-gene product interactions. Conserved enrichment of the vast majority of transcription factors suggests that the mDRG is a faithful model system for studying hDRG, because of evolutionarily conserved regulatory programs. Comparison of hDRG and tibial nerve transcriptomes suggests trafficking of neuronal mRNA to axons in adult hDRG, and are consistent with studies of axonal transport in rodent sensory neurons. We present our work as an online, searchable repository (https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/painneurosciencelab/sensoryomics/drgtxome), creating a valuable resource for the community.

34969046,Implementation of an electronic patient-reported measure of barriers to antiretroviral therapy adherence with the Opal patient portal: Protocol for a mixed method type 3 hybrid pilot study at a large Montreal HIV clinic.,"<h4>Background</h4>Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains problematic. Regular monitoring of its barriers is clinically recommended, however, patient-provider communication around adherence is often inadequate. Our team thus decided to develop a new electronically administered patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of barriers to ART adherence (the I-Score) to systematically capture this data for physician consideration in routine HIV care. To prepare for a controlled definitive trial to test the I-Score intervention, a pilot study was designed. Its primary objectives are to evaluate patient and physician perceptions of the I-Score intervention and its implementation strategy.<h4>Methods</h4>This one-arm, 6-month study will adopt a mixed method type 3 implementation-effectiveness hybrid design and be conducted at the Chronic Viral Illness Service of the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Canada). Four HIV physicians and 32 of their HIV patients with known or suspected adherence problems will participate. The intervention will involve having patients complete the I-Score through a smartphone application (Opal), before meeting with their physician. Both patients and physicians will have access to the I-Score results, for consideration during the clinic visits at Times 1, 2 (3 months), and 3 (6 months). The implementation strategy will focus on stakeholder involvement, education, and training; promoting the intervention's adaptability; and hiring an Application Manager to facilitate implementation. Implementation, patient, and service outcomes will be collected (Times 1-2-3). The primary outcome is the intervention's acceptability to patients and physicians. Qualitative data obtained, in part, through physician focus groups (Times 2-3) and patient interviews (Times 2-3) will help evaluate the implementation strategy and inform any methodological adaptations.<h4>Discussion</h4>This study will help plan a definitive trial to test the efficacy of the I-Score intervention. It will generate needed data on electronic PROM interventions in routine HIV care that will help improve understanding of conditions for their successful implementation.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04702412; https://clinicaltrials.gov/.",True,False,3.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,Implementation of an electronic patient-reported measure of barriers to antiretroviral therapy adherence with the Opal patient portal,True,False,False,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/,https://clinicaltrials.gov/,True,...n</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04702412; https://clinicaltrials.gov/.,1
23729657,"The non-obese diabetic mouse sequence, annotation and variation resource: an aid for investigating type 1 diabetes.","Model organisms are becoming increasingly important for the study of complex diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is an experimental model for T1D having been bred to develop the disease spontaneously in a process that is similar to humans. Genetic analysis of the NOD mouse has identified around 50 disease loci, which have the nomenclature Idd for insulin-dependent diabetes, distributed across at least 11 different chromosomes. In total, 21 Idd regions across 6 chromosomes, that are major contributors to T1D susceptibility or resistance, were selected for finished sequencing and annotation at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Here we describe the generation of 40.4 mega base-pairs of finished sequence from 289 bacterial artificial chromosomes for the NOD mouse. Manual annotation has identified 738 genes in the diabetes sensitive NOD mouse and 765 genes in homologous regions of the diabetes resistant C57BL/6J reference mouse across 19 candidate Idd regions. This has allowed us to call variation consequences between homologous exonic sequences for all annotated regions in the two mouse strains. We demonstrate the importance of this resource further by illustrating the technical difficulties that regions of inter-strain structural variation between the NOD mouse and the C57BL/6J reference mouse can cause for current next generation sequencing and assembly techniques. Furthermore, we have established that the variation rate in the Idd regions is 2.3 times higher than the mean found for the whole genome assembly for the NOD/ShiLtJ genome, which we suggest reflects the fact that positive selection for functional variation in immune genes is beneficial in regard to host defence. In summary, we provide an important resource, which aids the analysis of potential causative genes involved in T1D susceptibility.

26616131,Sankofa pediatric HIV disclosure intervention cyber data management: building capacity in a resource-limited setting and ensuring data quality.,"Prevalence of pediatric HIV disclosure is low in resource-limited settings. Innovative, culturally sensitive, and patient-centered disclosure approaches are needed. Conducting such studies in resource-limited settings is not trivial considering the challenges of capturing, cleaning, and storing clinical research data. To overcome some of these challenges, the Sankofa pediatric disclosure intervention adopted an interactive cyber infrastructure for data capture and analysis. The Sankofa Project database system is built on the HUBzero cyber infrastructure ( https://hubzero.org ), an open source software platform. The hub database components support: (1) data management - the ""databases"" component creates, configures, and manages database access, backup, repositories, applications, and access control; (2) data collection - the ""forms"" component is used to build customized web case report forms that incorporate common data elements and include tailored form submit processing to handle error checking, data validation, and data linkage as the data are stored to the database; and (3) data exploration - the ""dataviewer"" component provides powerful methods for users to view, search, sort, navigate, explore, map, graph, visualize, aggregate, drill-down, compute, and export data from the database. The Sankofa cyber data management tool supports a user-friendly, secure, and systematic collection of all data. We have screened more than 400 child-caregiver dyads and enrolled nearly 300 dyads, with tens of thousands of data elements. The dataviews have successfully supported all data exploration and analysis needs of the Sankofa Project. Moreover, the ability of the sites to query and view data summaries has proven to be an incentive for collecting complete and accurate data.

26387108,The Protein Ensemble Database.,"The scientific community's major conceptual notion of structural biology has recently shifted in emphasis from the classical structure-function paradigm due to the emergence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). As opposed to their folded cousins, these proteins are defined by the lack of a stable 3D fold and a high degree of inherent structural heterogeneity that is closely tied to their function. Due to their flexible nature, solution techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are particularly well-suited for characterizing their biophysical properties. Computationally derived structural ensembles based on such experimental measurements provide models of the conformational sampling displayed by these proteins, and they may offer valuable insights into the functional consequences of inherent flexibility. The Protein Ensemble Database (http://pedb.vib.be) is the first openly accessible, manually curated online resource storing the ensemble models, protocols used during the calculation procedure, and underlying primary experimental data derived from SAXS and/or NMR measurements.

The multi-fingerprint browser presented here (http://dcb-reymond23.unibe.ch:8080/MCSS/) enables one to rapidly identify such close analogs among commercially available compounds in the ZINC database (>13 million molecules). The browser retrieves nearest neighbors of any query molecule in multi-dimensional chemical spaces defined by four different fingerprints, each of which represents relevant structural and pharmacophoric features in a different way: sFP (substructure fingerprint), ECFP4 (extended connectivity fingerprint), MQNs (molecular quantum numbers) and SMIfp (SMILES fingerprint). Distances are calculated using the city-block distance, a similarity measure that performs as well as Tanimoto similarity but is much faster to compute. The list of up to 1000 nearest neighbors of any query molecule is retrieved by the browser and can be then clustered using the K-means clustering algorithm to produce a focused list of analogs with likely similar bioactivity to be considered for experimental evaluation.",True,False,3.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://dcb-reymond23.unibe.ch:8080/MCSS/,http://dcb-reymond23.unibe.ch:8080/MCSS/,True,...gs.

Extracting knowledge from biomedical literature and integrating it with relevant information from curated biological databases is essential to gain insight into COVID-19 etiology, diagnosis and treatment. We used Semantic Web technology RDF to integrate COVID-19 knowledge mined from literature by iTextMine, PubTator and SemRep with relevant biological databases and formalized the knowledge in a standardized and computable COVID-19 Knowledge Graph (KG). We published the COVID-19 KG via a SPARQL endpoint to support federated queries on the Semantic Web and developed a knowledge portal with browsing and searching interfaces. We also developed a RESTful API to support programmatic access and provided RDF dumps for download.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The COVID-19 Knowledge Graph is publicly available under CC-BY 4.0 license at https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/covid19kg/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,4.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/covid19kg/,https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/covid19kg/,True,...is publicly available under CC-BY 4.0 license at https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/covid19kg/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
27175227,Filtering large-scale event collections using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning for event trigger classification.,"<h4>Background</h4>Biomedical event extraction is one of the key tasks in biomedical text mining, supporting various applications such as database curation and hypothesis generation. Several systems, some of which have been applied at a large scale, have been introduced to solve this task. Past studies have shown that the identification of the phrases describing biological processes, also known as trigger detection, is a crucial part of event extraction, and notable overall performance gains can be obtained by solely focusing on this sub-task. In this paper we propose a novel approach for filtering falsely identified triggers from large-scale event databases, thus improving the quality of knowledge extraction.<h4>Methods</h4>Our method relies on state-of-the-art word embeddings, event statistics gathered from the whole biomedical literature, and both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. We focus on EVEX, an event database covering the whole PubMed and PubMed Central Open Access literature containing more than 40 million extracted events. The top most frequent EVEX trigger words are hierarchically clustered, and the resulting cluster tree is pruned to identify words that can never act as triggers regardless of their context. For rarely occurring trigger words we introduce a supervised approach trained on the combination of trigger word classification produced by the unsupervised clustering method and manual annotation.<h4>Results</h4>The method is evaluated on the official test set of BioNLP Shared Task on Event Extraction. The evaluation shows that the method can be used to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art event extraction systems. This successful effort also translates into removing 1,338,075 of potentially incorrect events from EVEX, thus greatly improving the quality of the data. The method is not solely bound to the EVEX resource and can be thus used to improve the quality of any event extraction system or database.<h4>Availability</h4>The data and source code for this work are available at: http://bionlp-www.utu.fi/trigger-clustering/.",True,False,5.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://bionlp-www.utu.fi/trigger-clustering/ | http://www.utu.fi/trigger-clustering/,http://bionlp-www.utu.fi/trigger-clustering/,True,...a and source code for this work are available at: http://bionlp-www.utu.fi/trigger-clustering/.,1
25111118,Genotype-based databases for variants causing rare diseases.,"Inherited diseases are the result of DNA sequence changes. In recessive diseases, the clinical phenotype results from the combined functional effects of variants in both copies of the gene. In some diseases there is often considerable variability of clinical presentation or disease severity, which may be predicted by the genotype. Additional effects may be triggered by environmental factors, as well as genetic modifiers which could be nucleotide polymorphisms in related genes, e.g. maternal ApoE or ABCA1 genotypes which may have an influence on the phenotype of SLOS individuals. Here we report the establishment of genotype variation databases for various rare diseases which provide individual clinical phenotypes associated with genotypes and include data about possible genetic modifiers. These databases aim to be an easy public access to information on rare and private variants with clinical data, which will facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants. The created databases include ACAD8 (isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBD)), ACADSB (short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency), AUH (3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGCA)), DHCR7 (Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome), HMGCS2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 deficiency), HSD17B10 (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase X deficiency), FKBP14 (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with progressive kyphoscoliosis, myopathy, and hearing loss; EDSKMH) and ROGDI (Kohlschütter-Tönz syndrome). These genes have been selected because of our specific research interests in these rare and metabolic diseases. The aim of the database was to include all identified individuals with variants in these specific genes. Identical genotypes are listed multiple times if they were found in several patients, phenotypic descriptions and biochemical data are included as detailed as possible in view also of validating the proposed pathogenicity of these genotypes. For DHCR7 genetic modifier data (maternal APOE and ABCA1 genotypes) is also included.

32943659,The landscape of microsatellites in the enset (Ensete ventricosum) genome and web-based marker resource development.,"Ensete ventricosum (Musaceae, enset) is an Ethiopian food security crop. To realize the potential of enset for rural livelihoods, further knowledge of enset diversity, genetics and genomics is required to support breeding programs and conservation. This study was conducted to explore the enset genome to develop molecular markers, genomics resources, and characterize enset landraces while giving insight into the organization of the genome. We identified 233 microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, SSRs) per Mbp in the enset genome, representing 0.28% of the genome. Mono- and di-nucleotide repeats motifs were found in a higher proportion than other classes of SSR-motifs. In total, 154,586 non-redundant enset microsatellite markers (EMM) were identified and 40 selected for primer development. Marker validation by PCR and low-cost agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that 92.5% were polymorphic, showing a high PIC (Polymorphism Information Content; 0.87) and expected heterozygosity (He = 0.79-0.82). In silico analysis of genomes of closely related species showed 46.86% of the markers were transferable among enset species and 1.90% were transferable to Musa. The SSRs are robust (with basic PCR methods and agarose gel electrophoresis), informative, and applicable in measuring enset diversity, genotyping, selection and potentially breeding.

29569340,Seventy Years of RN Effectiveness: A Database Development Project to Inform Best Practice.,"<h4>Background</h4>The appropriate nursing staff mix is imperative to the provision of quality care. Nurse staffing levels and staff mix vary from country to country, as well as between care settings. Understanding how staffing skill mix impacts patient, organizational, and financial outcomes is critical in order to allow policymakers and clinicians to make evidence-informed staffing decisions.<h4>Aims</h4>This paper reports on the methodology for creation of an electronic database of studies exploring the effectiveness of Registered Nurses (RNs) on clinical and patient outcomes, organizational and nurse outcomes, and financial outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in four electronic databases. Inclusion criteria for the database included studies published from 1946 to 2016, peer-reviewed international literature, and studies focused on RNs in all health-care disciplines, settings, and sectors. Masters-prepared nurse researchers conducted title and abstract screening and relevance review to determine eligibility of studies for the database. High-level analysis was conducted to determine key outcomes and the frequency at which they appeared within the database.<h4>Results</h4>Of the initial 90,352 records, a total of 626 abstracts were included within the database. Studies were organized into three groups corresponding to clinical and patient outcomes, organizational and nurse-related outcomes, and financial outcomes. Organizational and nurse-related outcomes represented the largest category in the database with 282 studies, followed by clinical and patient outcomes with 244 studies, and lastly financial outcomes, which included 124 studies.<h4>Linking evidence to action</h4>The comprehensive database of evidence for RN effectiveness is freely available at https://rnao.ca/bpg/initiatives/RNEffectiveness.

25343723,An online database for informing ecological network models: http://kelpforest.ucsc.edu.,"Ecological network models and analyses are recognized as valuable tools for understanding the dynamics and resiliency of ecosystems, and for informing ecosystem-based approaches to management. However, few databases exist that can provide the life history, demographic and species interaction information necessary to parameterize ecological network models. Faced with the difficulty of synthesizing the information required to construct models for kelp forest ecosystems along the West Coast of North America, we developed an online database (http://kelpforest.ucsc.edu/) to facilitate the collation and dissemination of such information. Many of the database's attributes are novel yet the structure is applicable and adaptable to other ecosystem modeling efforts. Information for each taxonomic unit includes stage-specific life history, demography, and body-size allometries. Species interactions include trophic, competitive, facilitative, and parasitic forms. Each data entry is temporally and spatially explicit. The online data entry interface allows researchers anywhere to contribute and access information. Quality control is facilitated by attributing each entry to unique contributor identities and source citations. The database has proven useful as an archive of species and ecosystem-specific information in the development of several ecological network models, for informing management actions, and for education purposes (e.g., undergraduate and graduate training).

21542935,A library of protein surface patches discriminates between native structures and decoys generated by structure prediction servers.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein surfaces serve as an interface with the molecular environment and are thus tightly bound to protein function. On the surface, geometric and chemical complementarity to other molecules provides interaction specificity for ligand binding, docking of bio-macromolecules, and enzymatic catalysis.As of today, there is no accepted general scheme to represent protein surfaces. Furthermore, most of the research on protein surface focuses on regions of specific interest such as interaction, ligand binding, and docking sites. We present a first step toward a general purpose representation of protein surfaces: a novel surface patch library that represents most surface patches (~98%) in a data set regardless of their functional roles.<h4>Results</h4>Surface patches, in this work, are small fractions of the protein surface. Using a measure of inter-patch distance, we clustered patches extracted from a data set of high quality, non-redundant, proteins. The surface patch library is the collection of all the cluster centroids; thus, each of the data set patches is close to one of the elements in the library.We demonstrate the biological significance of our method through the ability of the library to capture surface characteristics of native protein structures as opposed to those of decoy sets generated by state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods. The patches of the decoys are significantly less compatible with the library than their corresponding native structures, allowing us to reliably distinguish native models from models generated by servers. This trend, however, does not extend to the decoys themselves, as their similarity to the native structures does not correlate with compatibility with the library.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We expect that this high-quality, generic surface patch library will add a new perspective to the description of protein structures and improve our ability to predict them. In particular, we expect that it will help improve the prediction of surface features that are apparently neglected by current techniques.The surface patch libraries are publicly available at http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~keasar/patchLibrary.",True,False,3.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~keasar/patchLibrary,http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~keasar/patchLibrary,True,...surface patch libraries are publicly available at http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~keasar/patchLibrary.,1
25607539,A toolkit for ARB to integrate custom databases and externally built phylogenies.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Researchers are perpetually amassing biological sequence data. The computational approaches employed by ecologists for organizing this data (e.g. alignment, phylogeny, etc.) typically scale nonlinearly in execution time with the size of the dataset. This often serves as a bottleneck for processing experimental data since many molecular studies are characterized by massive datasets. To keep up with experimental data demands, ecologists are forced to choose between continually upgrading expensive in-house computer hardware or outsourcing the most demanding computations to the cloud. Outsourcing is attractive since it is the least expensive option, but does not necessarily allow direct user interaction with the data for exploratory analysis. Desktop analytical tools such as ARB are indispensable for this purpose, but they do not necessarily offer a convenient solution for the coordination and integration of datasets between local and outsourced destinations. Therefore, researchers are currently left with an undesirable tradeoff between computational throughput and analytical capability. To mitigate this tradeoff we introduce a software package to leverage the utility of the interactive exploratory tools offered by ARB with the computational throughput of cloud-based resources. Our pipeline serves as middleware between the desktop and the cloud allowing researchers to form local custom databases containing sequences and metadata from multiple resources and a method for linking data outsourced for computation back to the local database.

However, the low level of genetic resources has limited studies of their physiological events, as well as hindering research on the evolutionary history of land plants. In this study, to identify a comprehensive catalog of transcripts and characterize their expression traits in the fern Lygodium japonicum, nine different RNA samples isolated from prothalli, trophophylls, rhizomes and sporophylls were sequenced using Roche 454 GS-FLX and Illumina HiSeq sequencers. The hybrid assembly of the high-quality 454 GS-FLX and Illumina HiSeq reads generated a set of 37,830 isoforms with an average length of 1,444 bp. Using four open reading frame (ORF) predictors, 38,142 representative ORFs were identified from a total of 37,830 transcript isoforms and 95 contigs, which were annotated by searching against several public databases. Furthermore, an orthoMCL analysis using the protein sequences of L. japonicum and five model plants revealed various sets of lineage-specific genes, including those detected among land plant lineages and those detected in only L. japonicum.

22334387,The androgen receptor gene mutations database: 2012 update.,"The current version of the androgen receptor gene (AR) mutations database is described. A major change to the database is that the nomenclature and numbering scheme now conforms to all Human Genome Variation Society norms. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 605 to 1,029 since 2004. The database now contains a number of mutations that are associated with prostate cancer (CaP) treatment regimens, while the number of AR mutations found in CaP tissues has more than doubled from 76 to 159. In addition, in a number of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and CaP cases, multiple mutations have been found within the same tissue samples. For the first time, we report on a disconnect within the AIS phenotype-genotype relationship among our own patient database, in that over 40% of our patients with a classic complete AIS or partial AIS phenotypes did not appear to have a mutation in their AR gene. The implications of this phenomenon on future locus-specific mutation database (LSDB) development are discussed, together with the concept that mutations can be associated with both loss- and gain-of-function, and the effect of multiple AR mutations within individuals.

28200021,Statistical database analysis of the role of loop dynamics for protein-protein complex formation and allostery.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein loops show rich conformational dynamics properties on a wide range of timescales as they play an essential role for many cellular functions during protein-protein interactions and recognition processes. However, little is known about the detail behavior of loops upon protein binding including allostery.<h4>Results</h4>We report the loop motions and their dominant timescales for a library of 230 proteins that form protein-protein complexes using the ToeLoop predictor of loop dynamics. We applied the analysis to proteins in both their complex and free state and relate specific loop properties to their role in protein recognition. We observe a strong tendency of loops that move on relatively slow timescales of tens of ns to sub-μs to be directly involved in binding and recognition processes. Complex formation leads to a significant reduction in loop flexibility at the binding interface, but in a number of cases it can also trigger increased flexibility in distal loops in response to allosteric conformational changes. The importance of loop dynamics and allostery is highlighted by a case study of an antibody-antigen complex. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between loop dynamics and experimental binding affinities and found that a prevalence of high loop rigidity at the binding interface is an indicator of increased binding strength.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://spin.ccic.ohio-state.edu/index.php/toeloopppi.<h4>Contact</h4>bruschweiler.1@osu.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,3.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://spin.ccic.ohio-state.edu/index.php/toeloopppi,http://spin.ccic.ohio-state.edu/index.php/toeloopppi,True,...strength.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://spin.ccic.ohio-state.edu/index.php/toeloopppi.<h4>Contact</h4>bruschweiler.1@osu.edu.<h4>Supple...,1

Previously, we had trained an ensemble machine learning model to assign a probability of having synaptic function to every protein-coding gene in Drosophila melanogaster. This approach resulted in the publication of a catalogue of 893 genes which we postulated to be very enriched in genes with a still undocumented synaptic function. Since then, the scientific community has experimentally identified 79 new synaptic genes. Here we use these new empirical data to evaluate our original prediction. We also implement a series of changes to the training scheme of our model and using the new data we demonstrate that this improves its predictive power. Finally, we added the new synaptic genes to the training set and trained a new model, obtaining a new, enhanced catalogue of putative synaptic genes.<h4>Results</h4>The retrospective analysis demonstrate that our original catalogue was significantly enriched in new synaptic genes. When the changes to the training scheme were implemented using the original training set we obtained even higher enrichment. Finally, applying the new training scheme with a training set including the 79 new synaptic genes, resulted in an enhanced catalogue of putative synaptic genes. Here we present this new catalogue and announce that a regularly updated version will be available online at: http://synapticgenes.bnd.edu.uy CONCLUSIONS: We show that training an ensemble of machine learning classifiers solely with the whole-body temporal transcription profiles of known synaptic genes resulted in a catalogue with a significant enrichment in undiscovered synaptic genes. Using new empirical data provided by the scientific community, we validated our original approach, improved our model an obtained an arguably more precise prediction. This approach reduces the number of genes to be tested through hypothesis-driven experimentation and will facilitate our understanding of neuronal function.<h4>Availability</h4>http://synapticgenes.bnd.edu.uy.",True,False,4.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://synapticgenes.bnd.edu.uy,http://synapticgenes.bnd.edu.uy,True,...arly updated version will be available online at: http://synapticgenes.bnd.edu.uy CONCLUSIONS: We show that training an ensemble of...,1
27577934,Tiered Human Integrated Sequence Search Databases for Shotgun Proteomics.,"The results of analysis of shotgun proteomics mass spectrometry data can be greatly affected by the selection of the reference protein sequence database against which the spectra are matched. For many species there are multiple sources from which somewhat different sequence sets can be obtained. This can lead to confusion about which database is best in which circumstances-a problem especially acute in human sample analysis. All sequence databases are genome-based, with sequences for the predicted gene and their protein translation products compiled. Our goal is to create a set of primary sequence databases that comprise the union of sequences from many of the different available sources and make the result easily available to the community. We have compiled a set of four sequence databases of varying sizes, from a small database consisting of only the ∼20,000 primary isoforms plus contaminants to a very large database that includes almost all nonredundant protein sequences from several sources. This set of tiered, increasingly complete human protein sequence databases suitable for mass spectrometry proteomics sequence database searching is called the Tiered Human Integrated Search Proteome set. In order to evaluate the utility of these databases, we have analyzed two different data sets, one from the HeLa cell line and the other from normal human liver tissue, with each of the four tiers of database complexity. The result is that approximately 0.8%, 1.1%, and 1.5% additional peptides can be identified for Tiers 2, 3, and 4, respectively, as compared with the Tier 1 database, at substantially increasing computational cost. This increase in computational cost may be worth bearing if the identification of sequence variants or the discovery of sequences that are not present in the reviewed knowledge base entries is an important goal of the study. We find that it is useful to search a data set against a simpler database, and then check the uniqueness of the discovered peptides against a more complex database.

We populated it with 628 published disease-associated variants (December 2016) for: WFS1 (n = 309), CISD2 (n = 3), ALMS1 (n = 268), and SLC19A2 (n = 48) for Wolfram type 1, Wolfram type 2, Alström, and Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndromes, respectively; and included 23 previously unpublished novel germline variants in WFS1 and 17 variants in ALMS1. We then investigated genotype-phenotype relations for the WFS1 gene. The presence of biallelic loss-of-function variants predicted Wolfram syndrome defined by insulin-dependent diabetes and optic atrophy, with a sensitivity of 79% (95% CI 75%-83%) and specificity of 92% (83%-97%). The presence of minor loss-of-function variants in WFS1 predicted isolated diabetes, isolated deafness, or isolated congenital cataracts without development of the full syndrome (sensitivity 100% [93%-100%]; specificity 78% [73%-82%]). The ability to provide a prognostic prediction based on genotype will lead to improvements in patient care and counseling.

To add to these resources we sequenced 21 165 T-DNA lines, 15 569 of which were produced in this study. This increased the number of unique insertion sites in the T-DNA collection by 21 078, bringing the overall total to 26 112. Thirty-seven per cent (9754) of these insertion sites are within genes (including untranslated regions and introns) and 28% (7217) are within 500 bp of a gene. Approximately 31% of the genes in the v.2.1 annotation have been tagged in this population. To demonstrate the utility of this collection, we phenotypically characterized six T-DNA lines with insertions in genes previously shown in other systems to be involved in cellulose biosynthesis, hemicellulose biosynthesis, secondary cell wall development, DNA damage repair, wax biosynthesis and chloroplast synthesis. In all cases, the phenotypes observed supported previous studies, demonstrating the utility of this collection for plant functional genomics.

32561749,A clinically and genomically annotated nerve sheath tumor biospecimen repository.,"Nerve sheath tumors occur as a heterogeneous group of neoplasms in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

Lack of human tissue across the peripheral nerve tumors common in NF1 has been a major limitation in the development of new therapies. To address this unmet need, we have created an annotated collection of patient tumor samples, patient-derived cell lines, and patient-derived xenografts, and carried out high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic characterization to serve as a resource for further biologic and preclinical therapeutic studies.

33087719,Density functional theory-based electric field gradient database.,"The deviation of the electron density around the nuclei from spherical symmetry determines the electric field gradient (EFG), which can be measured by various types of spectroscopy. Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) is particularly sensitive to the EFG. The EFGs, and by implication NQR frequencies, vary dramatically across materials. Consequently, searching for NQR spectral lines in previously uninvestigated materials represents a major challenge. Calculated EFGs can significantly aid at the search's inception. To facilitate this task, we have applied high-throughput density functional theory calculations to predict EFGs for 15187 materials in the JARVIS-DFT database. This database, which will include EFG as a standard entry, is continuously increasing. Given the large scope of the database, it is impractical to verify each calculation. However, we assess accuracy by singling out cases for which reliable experimental information is readily available and compare them to the calculations.

27779497,Variable Selection for Confounding Adjustment in High-dimensional Covariate Spaces When Analyzing Healthcare Databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Data-adaptive approaches to confounding adjustment may improve performance beyond expert knowledge when analyzing electronic healthcare databases and have additional practical advantages for analyzing multiple databases in rapid cycles. Improvements seemed possible if outcome predictors were reliably identified empirically and adjusted.<h4>Methods</h4>In five cohort studies from diverse healthcare databases, we implemented a base-case high-dimensional propensity score algorithm with propensity score decile-adjusted outcome models to estimate treatment effects among prescription drug initiators. The original variable selection procedure based on the estimated bias of each variable using unadjusted associations between confounders and exposure (RRCE) and disease outcome (RRCD) was augmented by alternative strategies. These included using increasingly adjusted RRCD estimates, including models considering >1,500 variables jointly (Lasso, Bayesian logistic regression); using prediction statistics or likelihood-ratio statistics for covariate prioritization; directly estimating the propensity score with >1,500 variables (Lasso, Bayesian regression); or directly fitting an outcome model using all covariates jointly (Lasso, Ridge).<h4>Results</h4>In five example studies, most tested augmentations of the base-case hdPS did not meaningfully change estimates in light of wide confidence intervals except for Bayesian regression and Lasso to estimate RRCD, which moved estimates minimally closer to the expectation in three of five examples. The direct outcome estimation with Lasso performed worst.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Overall, the basic heuristic of variable reduction in high-dimensional propensity score adjustment performed, as well as alternative approaches in diverse settings. Minor improvements in variable selection may be possible using Bayesian outcome regression to prioritize variables for propensity score estimation when outcomes are rare.

However, the selection of promising candidates from the total quantity of possible epitopes poses a challenge to clinicians and bioinformaticians alike, and very few epitopes have been tested in experimental or clinical settings to validate their efficacy. Here, we present a comprehensive database of predicted nonmutated peptide epitopes derived from genes that are overly expressed in a group of 32 melanoma biopsies compared with healthy tissues and that were filtered against expression in a curated list of survival-critical tissues. We hypothesize that these ""self-tolerant"" epitopes have two desirable properties: they do not depend on mutations, being immediately applicable to a large patient collective, and they potentially cause fewer autoimmune reactions. To support epitope selection, we provide an aggregated score of expected therapeutic efficiency as a shortlist mechanism.

We aimed to understand current practice in addressing this bias in pharmacoepidemiology database studies and to develop an open source application (app) from existing methodology to demonstrate the impact and mechanism of this bias on results.<h4>Methods</h4>Studies of an exposure and a clinical outcome were selected from all Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety publications during 2017 and any reference to outcome misclassification described. An app to correct risk ratio (RR) and cumulative incidence for outcome misclassification was developed from a published methodology and used to demonstrate the impact of correction on point estimates.<h4>Results</h4>Eight (19%) of 43 papers selected reported estimates of outcome ascertainment accuracy with positive predictive value (PPV) the most commonly reported measure (7 of 8 studies). Three studies (7%) corrected for the bias, 1 by exposure strata, and 5 (12%) restricted analyses to confirmed cases. The app (app http://apps.p-95.com/ISPE/) uses values of PPV and sensitivity (or a range of possible values) in each exposure strata and returns corrected point estimates and confidence intervals. The app demonstrates that small differences between comparison groups in PPV or sensitivity can introduce bias even when accuracy estimates are high.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Outcome misclassification is not usually corrected in pharmacoepidemiology database studies although correction methods using routinely measured indices are available.

26538599,Tools and data services registry: a community effort to document bioinformatics resources.,"Life sciences are yielding huge data sets that underpin scientific discoveries fundamental to improvement in human health, agriculture and the environment. In support of these discoveries, a plethora of databases and tools are deployed, in technically complex and diverse implementations, across a spectrum of scientific disciplines. The corpus of documentation of these resources is fragmented across the Web, with much redundancy, and has lacked a common standard of information. The outcome is that scientists must often struggle to find, understand, compare and use the best resources for the task at hand.Here we present a community-driven curation effort, supported by ELIXIR-the European infrastructure for biological information-that aspires to a comprehensive and consistent registry of information about bioinformatics resources. The sustainable upkeep of this Tools and Data Services Registry is assured by a curation effort driven by and tailored to local needs, and shared amongst a network of engaged partners.As of November 2015, the registry includes 1785 resources, with depositions from 126 individual registrations including 52 institutional providers and 74 individuals. With community support, the registry can become a standard for dissemination of information about bioinformatics resources: we welcome everyone to join us in this common endeavour.

34108585,Development of a time-series shotgun metagenomics database for monitoring microbial communities at the Pacific coast of Japan.,"Although numerous metagenome, amplicon sequencing-based studies have been conducted to date to characterize marine microbial communities, relatively few have employed full metagenome shotgun sequencing to obtain a broader picture of the functional features of these marine microbial communities. Moreover, most of these studies only performed sporadic sampling, which is insufficient to understand an ecosystem comprehensively. In this study, we regularly conducted seawater sampling along the northeastern Pacific coast of Japan between March 2012 and May 2016. We collected 213 seawater samples and prepared size-based fractions to generate 454 subsets of samples for shotgun metagenome sequencing and analysis. We also determined the sequences of 16S rRNA (n = 111) and 18S rRNA (n = 47) gene amplicons from smaller sample subsets. We thereafter developed the Ocean Monitoring Database for time-series metagenomic data ( http://marine-meta.healthscience.sci.waseda.ac.jp/omd/ ), which provides a three-dimensional bird's-eye view of the data. This database includes results of digital DNA chip analysis, a novel method for estimating ocean characteristics such as water temperature from metagenomic data. Furthermore, we developed a novel classification method that includes more information about viruses than that acquired using BLAST. We further report the discovery of a large number of previously overlooked (TAG)n repeat sequences in the genomes of marine microbes. We predict that the availability of this time-series database will lead to major discoveries in marine microbiome research.",True,False,4.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,False,False,,http://marine-meta.healthscience.sci.waseda.ac.jp/omd/,http://marine-meta.healthscience.sci.waseda.ac.jp/omd/,True,"...oring Database for time-series metagenomic data ( http://marine-meta.healthscience.sci.waseda.ac.jp/omd/ ), which provides a three-dimensional bird's-eye...",1
23230006,The Chloroplast Function Database II: a comprehensive collection of homozygous mutants and their phenotypic/genotypic traits for nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins.,"The Chloroplast Function Database has so far offered phenotype information on mutants of the nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins in Arabidopsis that pertains to >200 phenotypic data sets that were obtained from 1,722 transposon- or T-DNA-tagged lines. Here, we present the development of the second version of the database, which is named the Chloroplast Function Database II and was redesigned to increase the number of mutant characters and new user-friendly tools for data mining and integration. The upgraded database offers information on genome-wide mutant screens for any visible phenotype against 2,495 tagged lines to create a comprehensive homozygous mutant collection. The collection consists of 147 lines with seedling phenotypes and 185 lines for which we could not obtain homozygotes, as well as 1,740 homozygotes with wild-type phenotypes. Besides providing basic information about primer lists that were used for the PCR genotyping of T-DNA-tagged lines and explanations about the preparation of homozygous mutants and phenotype screening, the database includes access to a link between the gene locus and existing publicly available databases. This gives users access to a combined pool of data, enabling them to gain valuable insights into biological processes. In addition, high-resolution images of plastid morphologies of mutants with seedling-specific chloroplast defects as observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are available in the current database. This database is used to compare the phenotypes of visually identifiable mutants with their plastid ultrastructures and to evaluate their potential significance from characteristic patterns of plastid morphology in vivo. Thus, the Chloroplast Function Database II is a useful and comprehensive information resource that can help researchers to connect individual Arabidopsis genes to plastid functions on the basis of phenotype analysis of our tagged mutant collection.

22968136,Expanding the MTM1 mutational spectrum: novel variants including the first multi-exonic duplication and development of a locus-specific database.,"Myotubular myopathy (MIM#310400), the X-linked form of Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is mainly characterized by neonatal hypotonia and inability to maintain unassisted respiration. The MTM1 gene, responsible for this disease, encodes myotubularin - a lipidic phosphatase involved in vesicle trafficking regulation and maturation. Recently, it was shown that myotubularin interacts with desmin, being a major regulator of intermediate filaments. We report the development of a locus-specific database for MTM1 using the Leiden Open Variation database software (http://www.lovd.nl/MTM1), with data collated for 474 mutations identified in 472 patients (by June 2012). Among the entries are a total of 25 new mutations, including a large deletion encompassing introns 2-15. During database implementation it was noticed that no large duplications had been reported. We tested a group of eight uncharacterized CNM patients for this specific type of mutation, by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. A large duplication spanning exons 1-5 was identified in a boy with a mild phenotype, with results pointing toward possible somatic mosaicism. Further characterization revealed that this duplication causes an in-frame deletion at the mRNA level (r.343_444del). Results obtained with a next generation sequencing approach suggested that the duplication extends into the neighboring MAMLD1 gene and subsequent cDNA analysis detected the presence of a MTM1/MAMLD1 fusion transcript. A complex rearrangement involving the duplication of exon 10 has since been reported, with detection also enabled by MLPA analysis. It is thus conceivable that large duplications in MTM1 may account for a number of CNM cases that have remained genetically unresolved.",True,False,3.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,Expanding the MTM1 mutational spectrum,True,False,False,,http://www.lovd.nl/MTM1,http://www.lovd.nl/MTM1,True,"...sing the Leiden Open Variation database software (http://www.lovd.nl/MTM1), with data collated for 474 mutations identified...",1
33455583,Establishment and application of information resource of mutant mice in RIKEN BioResource Research Center.,"Online databases are crucial infrastructures to facilitate the wide effective and efficient use of mouse mutant resources in life sciences. The number and types of mouse resources have been rapidly growing due to the development of genetic modification technology with associated information of genomic sequence and phenotypes. Therefore, data integration technologies to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of mouse strain data becomes essential for mouse strain repositories. In 2020, the RIKEN BioResource Research Center released an integrated database of bioresources including, experimental mouse strains, Arabidopsis thaliana as a laboratory plant, cell lines, microorganisms, and genetic materials using Resource Description Framework-related technologies. The integrated database shows multiple advanced features for the dissemination of bioresource information. The current version of our online catalog of mouse strains which functions as a part of the integrated database of bioresources is available from search bars on the page of the Center ( https://brc.riken.jp ) and the Experimental Animal Division ( https://mus.brc.riken.jp/ ) websites.

32866223,A database of flavivirus RNA structures with a search algorithm for pseudoknots and triple base interactions.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The Flavivirus genus includes several important pathogens, such as Zika, dengue and yellow fever virus. Flavivirus RNA genomes contain a number of functionally important structures in their 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). Due to the diversity of sequences and topologies of these structures, their identification is often difficult. In contrast, predictions of such structures are important for understanding of flavivirus replication cycles and development of antiviral strategies.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an algorithm for structured pattern search in RNA sequences, including secondary structures, pseudoknots and triple base interactions. Using the data on known conserved flavivirus 3'UTR structures, we constructed structural descriptors which covered the diversity of patterns in these motifs. The descriptors and the search algorithm were used for the construction of a database of flavivirus 3'UTR structures. Validating this approach, we identified a number of domains matching a general pattern of exoribonuclease Xrn1-resistant RNAs in the growing group of insect-specific flaviviruses.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Leiden Flavivirus RNA Structure Database is available at https://rna.liacs.nl.

23396323,The annotation-enriched non-redundant patent sequence databases.,"The EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) offers public access to patent sequence data, providing a valuable service to the intellectual property and scientific communities. The non-redundant (NR) patent sequence databases comprise two-level nucleotide and protein sequence clusters (NRNL1, NRNL2, NRPL1 and NRPL2) based on sequence identity (level-1) and patent family (level-2). Annotation from the source entries in these databases is merged and enhanced with additional information from the patent literature and biological context. Corrections in patent publication numbers, kind-codes and patent equivalents significantly improve the data quality. Data are available through various user interfaces including web browser, downloads via FTP, SRS, Dbfetch and EBI-Search. Sequence similarity/homology searches against the databases are available using BLAST, FASTA and PSI-Search. In this article, we describe the data collection and annotation and also outline major changes and improvements introduced since 2009. Apart from data growth, these changes include additional annotation for singleton clusters, the identifier versioning for tracking entry change and the entry mappings between the two-level databases.
