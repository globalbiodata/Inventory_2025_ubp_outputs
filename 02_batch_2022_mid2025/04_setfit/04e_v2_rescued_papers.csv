39314060.0,Hyperspectral Imaging Database of Human Facial Skin.,"The perceived color of human skin is the result of the interaction of environmental lighting with the skin. Only by resorting to human skin spectral reflectance, it is possible to obtain physical outcomes of this interaction. The purpose of this work was to provide a cured and validated database of hyperspectral images of human faces, useful for several applications, such as psychophysics-based research, object recognition, and material modeling. The hyperspectral imaging data from 29 human faces with different skin tones and sexes, under constant lighting and controlled movements, were described and characterized. Each hyperspectral image, which comprised spectral reflectance of the whole face from 400 to 720 nm in 10 nm steps at each pixel, was analyzed between and within nine facial positions located at different areas of the face. Simultaneously, spectral measurements at the same nine facial positions using conventional local point and/or contact devices were used to ascertain the data. It was found that the spectral reflectance profile changed between skin tones, subjects, and facial locations. Important local variations of the spectral reflectance profile showed that extra care is needed when considering average values from conventional devices at the same area of measurement.",bio-resource,0.99256426,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39314060,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.49950823,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38684624.0,TACO: A Turkish database for abstract concepts.,"The organization of abstract concepts reflects different dimensions, grounded in the brain regions coding for the corresponding experience. Normative measures of linguistic stimuli offer noteworthy insights into the organization of conceptual knowledge, but studies differ in the dimensions and classes of concepts considered. Additionally, most of the available information has been collected in English, without considering possible linguistic and cultural differences. Here, we aimed to create a comprehensive Turkish database for abstract concepts (TACO), including rarely investigated classes such as political concepts. We included 503 words-78 concrete (fruits, animals, tools) and 425 abstract (emotions, social, mental states, theoretical, quantity, space, political)-rated by 134 Turkish speakers for familiarity, imageability, age of acquisition, valence, arousal, quantity, space, theoretical, social, mental state, and political dimensions. We calculated dominance and exclusivity, indicating the dimension receiving the highest mean score for each word, and the position of the word along the unidimensional-multidimensional continuum, respectively. A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the semantic dimensions. The results showed that mental state was the dominant dimension for most concepts. Moderate to low levels of exclusivity indicated that the concepts were multidimensional. PCA revealed three components: Component 1 captured the juxtaposition between social/mental state and magnitude polarities, Component 2 highlighted affective components, and Component 3 grouped together political and theoretical dimensions. The introduction of political concepts provided insights into the multidimensional nature of this unexplored class, closely intertwined with the theoretical dimension. TACO constitutes the first comprehensive Turkish database covering several abstract dimensions, paving the way for cross-linguistic and cross-cultural studies of semantic representations.",bio-resource,0.99802774,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38684624,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.49922884,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36613506.0,Full-Length Transcriptome of <i>Myotis pilosus</i> as a Reference Resource and Mining of Auditory and Immune Related Genes.,"Rickett's big-footed bat, <i>Myotis pilosus</i>, which belongs to the family Vespertilionida, is the only known piscivorous bat in East Asia. Accurate whole genome and transcriptome annotations are essential for the study of bat biological evolution. The lack of a whole genome for <i>M. pilosus</i> has limited our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the species' evolution, echolocation, and immune response. In the present work, we sequenced the entire transcriptome using error-corrected PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) data. Then, a total of 40 GB of subreads were generated, including 29,991 full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) sequences. After correction by Illumina short reads and de-redundancy, we obtained 26,717 error-corrected isoforms with an average length of 3018.91 bp and an N50 length of 3447 bp. A total of 1528 alternative splicing (AS) events were detected by transcriptome structural analysis. Furthermore, 1032 putative transcription factors (TFs) were identified, with additional identification of several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with high confidence. Moreover, several key genes, including <i>PRL-2</i>, <i>DPP4</i>, <i>Glul</i>, and <i>ND1</i> were also identified as being associated with metabolism, immunity, nervous system processes, and auditory perception. A multitude of pattern recognition receptors was identified, including NLR, RLR, SRCR, the antiviral molecule IRF3, and the IFN receptor subunit IFNAR1.

36074108.0,Building a Comprehensive Biopsychosocial Database to Identify Underlying Causes of Suicide and Improve Suicide Prevention.,"In June, 2022, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced an initiative to reduce death due to suicide in US Veterans. This column is based on a proposal written for that initiative, as well as on an earlier psychopharmacology column in this journal that reviewed the statistics and the genetics of suicide, and the US medicolegal death investigation system. This system is composed of 3137 county coroner or medical examiner offices across the country that are responsible under state and local law for investigating deaths that are not explained by natural causes and are suspicious and/or unattended. Thus, this system gathers data concerning all deaths due to suicide. Currently this death investigation system costs US taxpayers ∼$660 million per year, and it has determined that ∼45,000 Americans die from suicide each year. In the conduct of these investigations, a large amount of data is collected, including biological samples. While the demographic data are reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), little-if anything-is done with the collected biological material beyond its use in determining the cause of death of the individual. The earlier column on this topic advocated for the establishment of a central database to retain and utilize this information to further understand the biopsychosocial causes of suicide, with the goal of preventing suicides. This column describes a proposal submitted to the VA system for how such a system could initially be piloted in a small group of VA medical centers and then expanded to the entire system. This initial effort could then, in turn, serve as a model for expanding such data gathering to the entire US medicolegal death investigation system.",bio-resource,0.7989455,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36074108,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.49773058,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40544559.0,A comparison of the Abraham and Wayne state university compound descriptor databases for use with the solvation parameter model.,"The solvation parameter model employs six fixed descriptors (seven for compounds that exhibit variable hydrogen-bond basicity) to characterize the contribution of intermolecular interactions to equilibrium distribution properties. McGowan's characteristic volume (V) and excess molar refraction (E) for liquids at 20 °C can be calculated from structure and a refractive index value in the case of E. The remaining descriptors identified as dipolarity/polarizability (S), overall hydrogen-bond acidity (A), overall hydrogen-bond basicity (B or B°), the gas-liquid partition constant at 25 °C (L), and E for solids at 20 °C are experimental quantities more likely to vary when taken from different sources. There are two large, curated descriptor databases, known as the Abraham and Wayne State University (WSU-2025) databases that facilitate applications of the solvation parameter model to separation systems. These databases were developed independently using different experimental data. In some cases, this has led to significantly different descriptor assignments for the same compound. In this report, descriptor quality for over 300 compounds sourced from the above curated databases are compared using a generalized compound classification scheme and filters for descriptor difference values. For n-alkanes and monofunctional n-alkanes there are only small differences in descriptor values. Significantly larger differences are observed for multifunctional compounds including systematic differences in at least one descriptor for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalate esters, phenols, amides, and compounds of variable hydrogen-bond basicity. Partition constants for octanol-water, n-heptane-2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, and n-heptane-formamide biphasic systems, and gas chromatographic retention factors on a poly(3-cyanopropylphenyldimethylsiloxane) stationary phase are used to verify descriptor quality. The WSU-2025 database shows a significant improvement in model quality with better precision than the Abraham database descriptors as well as facilitating the identification of compounds likely to have misassigned descriptors in the Abraham database.",bio-resource,0.5656734,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40544559,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.4974924,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38438840.0,De novo assembly and annotation of the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) genome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) is an economically and ecologically important fish species in the family Nototheniidae. Juveniles occupy progressively deeper waters as they mature and grow, and adults have been caught as deep as 2500 m, living on or in just above the southern shelves and slopes around the sub-Antarctic islands of the Southern Ocean. As apex predators, they are a key part of the food web, feeding on a variety of prey, including krill, squid, and other fish. Despite its importance, genomic sequence data, which could be used for more accurate dating of the divergence between Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish, or establish whether it shares adaptations to temperature with fish living in more polar or equatorial climes, has so far been limited.<h4>Results</h4>A high-quality D. eleginoides genome was generated using a combination of Illumina, PacBio and Omni-C sequencing technologies. To aid the genome annotation, the transcriptome derived from a variety of toothfish tissues was also generated using both short and long read sequencing methods. The final genome assembly was 797.8 Mb with a N50 scaffold length of 3.5 Mb. Approximately 31.7% of the genome consisted of repetitive elements. A total of 35,543 putative protein-coding regions were identified, of which 50% have been functionally annotated. Transcriptomics analysis showed that approximately 64% of the predicted genes (22,617 genes) were found to be expressed in the tissues sampled. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that the anti-freeze glycoprotein (AFGP) locus of D. eleginoides does not contain any AFGP proteins compared to the same locus in the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni). This is in agreement with previously published results looking at hybridization signals and confirms that Patagonian toothfish do not possess AFGP coding sequences in their genome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have assembled and annotated the Patagonian toothfish genome, which will provide a valuable genetic resource for ecological and evolutionary studies on this and other closely related species.",bio-resource,0.67169523,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38438840,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.4974387,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40800421.0,A database of the healthy human spinal cord morphometry in the PAM50 template space.,"Measures of spinal cord morphometry computed from magnetic resonance images serve as relevant prognostic biomarkers for a range of spinal cord pathologies, including traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases. However, interpreting these imaging biomarkers is difficult due to considerable intra- and inter-subject variability. Yet, there is no clear consensus on a normalization method that would help reduce this variability and more insights into the distribution of these morphometrics are needed. In this study, we computed a database of normative values for six commonly used measures of spinal cord morphometry: cross-sectional area, anteroposterior diameter, transverse diameter, compression ratio, eccentricity, and solidity. Normative values were computed from a large open-access dataset of healthy adult volunteers (N = 203) and were brought to the common space of the PAM50 spinal cord template using a newly proposed normalization method based on linear interpolation. Compared to traditional image-based registration, the proposed normalization approach does not involve image transformations and, therefore, does not introduce distortions of spinal cord anatomy. This is a crucial consideration in preserving the integrity of the spinal cord anatomy in conditions such as spinal cord injury. This new morphometric database allows researchers to normalize based on sex and age, thereby minimizing inter-subject variability associated with demographic and biological factors.

39975586.0,Environmental impact of Norwegian food and beverages: compilation of a life cycle assessment food database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Food production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Climate and environmental impacts from food production vary across geographical areas. To estimate these impacts of food and diets, country-specific data are needed.<h4>Objective</h4>This project aimed to compile an environmental impact food database, including the impact categories (ICs) global warming potential, soil acidification, freshwater and saltwater eutrophication, water use and land use, representative of the Norwegian diet.<h4>Design</h4>The compilation was based on literature searches for original life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on foods, including domestic and imported foods, which constitute the habitual diet in Norway. Food items of importance in the average Norwegian diet were identified based on the national dietary survey Norkost 3. The study's generic system boundaries included impacts from farm to fork: production, processing, packaging, transportation, storage and food preparation at home. Conversion factors for edible portions were applied when relevant. When LCA data of a certain food were missing, data from foods with similar cultivation conditions and nutritional composition were used as proxies. Data from other LCA food databases were also used if original LCA studies were not identified, or the LCA studies found were evaluated as being of poor quality.<h4>Results</h4>The compiled database is tailored specifically for and covers main animal- and plant-based foods in the Norwegian diet.<h4>Discussion</h4>Limitations of the compilation project include the fact that most LCA studies identified in the present project covered ICs up to the farm gate and used varying methodology. Also, proxy values were used when data for specific food items were missing. These methodological issues introduce variability and complicate direct comparisons. The strength of the present study is the thorough work in compiling and filling data gaps for the IC values of foods in the Norwegian diet.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Norwegian LCA food database enables simultaneous estimation of food and nutrient intakes and estimation of climate and environmental impacts of Norwegian diets.",bio-resource,0.9274923,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39975586,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.4946602,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

This study aims to refine the gene annotation of the A1 peptidase family in this organism through proteogenomics. A comprehensive analysis of aspartic protease gene sequences and protein isoforms, identified by proteomics, revealed discrepancies in existing gene annotations, including the identification of novel open reading frames and the consolidation of previously separated gene sequences. Our efforts led to the correction of seven gene annotations, reducing the total count of A1 peptidase genes from 19 to 15. Notably, 11 of these genes were confirmed at the protein level, while two were supported by transcriptomic data. Furthermore, our findings highlight instances of alternative splicing, as seen in RPRC015076, where proteoforms T1IFK7 and R4G5J6 are expressed through intron retention. This study not only provides a more accurate and comprehensive genomic framework for the A1 peptidase family but also offers new insights into the functional complexity and regulation of digestive enzymes in <i>R. prolixus</i>.

Imputation and filtering processes were carried out based on the percentage of missing data, redundant markers, and rarest allele frequencies, resulting in a final dataset of 15,872 SNP markers for which a physical map position was identified. Using this dataset, the inbred panel was characterized for linkage disequilibrium (LD), genetic diversity, population structure, and genetic relationships. LD decay at a genome-wide level indicates that the collection is a suitable resource for association mapping. Population structure analyses, which were carried out with different clustering methods, showed stable grouping statistics for four groups, broadly corresponding to 'Insubria', 'Microsperma', and 'Scagliolino' genotypes, with a fourth group composed prevalently of elite accessions derived from Italian and US breeding programs. Based on these results, the CREA Italian maize collection, genetically characterized in this study, can be considered an important tool for the mapping and characterization of useful traits and associated loci/alleles, to be used in maize breeding programs.",bio-resource,0.8842179,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38337869,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.49317825,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39839853.0,The Multicentre Acute ischemic stroke imaGIng and Clinical data (MAGIC) repository: rationale and blueprint.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The Multicentre Acute ischemic stroke imaGIng and Clinical data (MAGIC) repository is a collaboration established in 2024 by seven stroke centres in Europe. MAGIC consolidates clinical and radiological data from acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients who underwent endovascular therapy, intravenous thrombolysis, a combination of both, or conservative management.<h4>Participants</h4>All centres ensure accuracy and completeness of the data. Only patients who did not refuse use of their routine data collected during or after their hospital stay are included in the repository. Approvals or waivers are obtained from the responsible ethics committees before data exchange. A formal data transfer agreement (DTA) is signed by all contributing centres. The centres then share their data, and files are stored centrally on a safe server at the University Hospital Zurich. There, patient identifiers are removed and images are algorithmically de-faced. De-identified structured clinical data are connected to the imaging data by a new identifier. Data are made available to participating centres which have entered into a DTA for stroke research projects.<h4>Repository setup</h4>Initially, MAGIC is set to comprise initial and first follow-up imaging of 2,500 AIS patients. Clinical data consist of a comprehensive set of patient characteristics and routine prehospital metrics, treatment and laboratory variables.<h4>Outlook</h4>Our repository will support research by leveraging the entire range of routinely collected imaging and clinical data. This dataset reflects the current state of practice in stroke patient evaluation and management and will enable researchers to retrospectively study clinically relevant questions outside the scope of randomized controlled clinical trials. New centres are invited to join MAGIC if they meet the requirements outlined here. We aim to reach approximately 10,000 cases by 2026.",bio-resource,0.9888349,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39839853,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.49317783,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40666496.0,Japan-Medical Image Database (J-MID): Medical Big Data Supporting Data Science.,"The digitization of radiology practices has advanced for nearly two decades, exemplified by the global standard Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). Rapid technological progress in imaging modalities has led to a significant increase in the volume of data handled. However, it has become difficult for the limited number of radiologists in Japan to maintain the quality of diagnosis while efficiently processing the data. In response, the Japan Radiological Society (JRS) advocated the ""Japan Safe Radiology"" Initiative, which aims to improve the safety, efficiency, and quality of radiological medicine by actively utilizing information and communication technology (ICT) in all aspects of radiological practice. Recent advances in innovative artificial intelligence (AI) technology have shown a high affinity for image processing, prompting recognition of the importance of using big data systems to integrate radiological medicine. Consequently, in 2017, the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) supported the JRS project, Development Research for the Realization of a National Image Diagnosis Database, through which the Japan Medical Image Database (J-MID) was established. The J-MID is designed to centralize medical resources and systematically collect CT/MR images and diagnostic reports from 10 major university hospitals in Japan through an academic information network (SINET). Data were anonymized and stored on a central server in the cloud, enabling researchers to utilize J-MID conveniently. In April 2024, J-MID had collected more than 534 million images (1.65 million cases), making it an unparalleled repository of real-world radiological data in Japan.",bio-resource,0.99720407,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40666496,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.49314538,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39911660.0,Development of robust constitutive synthetic promoter using genetic resources of plant pararetroviruses.,"With the advancement of plant synthetic biology, complex genetic engineering circuits are being developed, which require more diverse genetic regulatory elements (promoters) to operate. Constitutive promoters are widely used for such gene engineering projects, but the list of strong, constitutive plant promoters with strength surpassing the widely used promoter, the CaMV35S, is limited. In this work, we attempted to increase the constitutive promoter library by developing efficient synthetic promoters suitable for high-level gene expression. To do that, we selected three strong pararetroviral-based promoters from <i>Mirabilis mosaic virus</i> (MMV), <i>Figwort mosaic virus</i> (FMV), and <i>Horseradish latent virus</i> (HRLV) and rationally designed and combined their promoter elements. We then tested the newly developed promoters in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and found a highly active tri-hybrid promoter, MuasFuasH17 (MFH17). We further used these promoter elements in generating random mutant promoters by DNA shuffling techniques in an attempt to change/improve the MFH17 promoter. We further evaluated the activity of the MFH17 promoter in <i>Oryza sativa</i> seedlings and studied the effect of as-1 elements present in it. Finally, we tested the efficacy and tissue specificity of the MFH17 promoter <i>in planta</i> by developing transgenic <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants and found it highly constitutive and efficient in driving the gene throughout the plant tissues. Overall, we conclude that this tripartite synthetic promoter MFH17 is a strong, highly constitutive, and dual-species (dicot and monocot) expressing promoter, which can be a valuable addition to the constitutive plant promoter library for plant synthetic biology.",bio-resource,0.8277508,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39911660,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.49312565,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37795255.0,SIGnature Libraries: A roadmap for the formation of special interest group libraries.,"<h4>Objective</h4>""SIGnature Libraries"" channel the dynamism of academic society-based special interest groups (SIG) to systematically identify and provide user-oriented access to essential literature for a subspecialty field in a manner that keeps pace with the field's continuing evolution. The libraries include literature beyond clinical trial data to encompass historical context, diagnostic conceptualization, and community organization materials to foster a holistic understanding of how neurologic conditions affect individuals, their community, and their lived experience.<h4>Methods</h4>Utilizing a modified-Delphi approach, Child Neurology Society's Cerebral Palsy (CP) SIG (<i>n</i> = 75) administered two rounds of literature submissions and ratings. A final review by an 11-member international advisory group determined threshold ratings for resource inclusion and the library's final structure.<h4>Results</h4>Seventy-nine articles were submitted for the first Delphi round and 22 articles for the second Delphi round. Survey response rates among SIG members were 29/75 for the first round and 24/75 for the second round. The advisory board added additional articles in the final review process in view of the overall project goal. A total of 60 articles were included in the final library, and articles were divided into seven sections and stratified by rating scores. A process for ongoing revisions of the library was determined. The library will be published on the Child Neurology Society website and made publicly accessible.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The CP SIGnature Library offers learners an unprecedented resource that provides equitable access to latest consensus guidelines, existing seminal datasets, up-to-date review articles, and other patient care tools. A distinctive feature of the library is its intentional large scope and depth, presented in a stratified fashion relative to the consensus-determined importance of each article.

The F1 hybrids of female channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) × male blue catfish (Ictalurusfurcatus) have been the primary driver of US catfish production in recent years because of superior growth, survival, and carcass yield. The channel-blue hybrid also provides an excellent model to investigate molecular mechanisms of environment-dependent heterosis. However, transcriptome and methylome studies suffered from low alignment rates to the channel catfish genome due to divergence, and the genome resources for blue catfish are not publicly available.<h4>Results</h4>The blue catfish genome assembly is 841.86 Mbp in length with excellent continuity (8.6 Mbp contig N50, 28.2 Mbp scaffold N50) and completeness (98.6% Eukaryota and 97.0% Actinopterygii BUSCO). A total of 30,971 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 21,781 were supported by RNA sequencing evidence. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that it diverged from channel catfish approximately 9 million years ago with 15.7 million fixed nucleotide differences. The within-species single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density is 0.32% between the most aquaculturally important blue catfish strains (D&B and Rio Grande). Gene family analysis discovered significant expansion of immune-related families in the blue catfish lineage, which may contribute to disease resistance in blue catfish.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We reported the first high-quality, chromosome-level assembly of the blue catfish genome, which provides the necessary genomic tool kit for transcriptome and methylome analysis, SNP discovery and marker-assisted selection, gene editing and genome engineering, and reproductive enhancement of the blue catfish and hybrid catfish.",bio-resource,0.8491032,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35809049,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.49235255,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

38843790.0,VOLKSMED Database: A Source for Forgotten Wound Healing Plants in Austrian Folk Medicine.,"The global increase in the incidence of wounds is concerning and fuels the search for new treatment options. The use of traditional medicinal plants in wound healing represents an appreciated available therapeutic possibility. This work introduces the VOLKSMED database, which contains plants and other materials used in Austrian folk medicine, either as monographs or mixtures. This work focuses on the monographs of the database. Concerning wound healing, <i>Hypericum</i> sp., <i>Arnica montana, Calendula officinalis, Plantago</i> sp., and <i>Malva</i> sp. are the most commonly used plants. The focus of this paper is set on selected lesser-known plants (<i>Abies alba, Anthyllis vulneraria, Brassica</i> sp., <i>Gentiana</i> sp., <i>Larix decidua, Picea abies, Sambucus</i> sp., <i>Sanicula europaea</i>) and their status quo in literature concerning wound healing. A systematic search using the databases SciFinder, SCOPUS, and PubMed yielded substantial evidence for the wound healing potential of <i>Brassica</i> sp., <i>Gentiana</i> sp., the Pinaceae <i>A. abies, L. decidua,</i> and <i>P. abies</i>, as well as <i>Sambucus nigra. In vivo</i> and clinical studies substantiate their use in Austrian folk medicine. According to the literature, especially <i>A. vulneraria, Sambucus racemosa,</i> and <i>S. europaea</i> would be worth investigating in-depth since data concerning their wound healing effects - even though scarce - are convincing.

In this study, we used a multi-omic approach to analyze the transcriptome and epigenome profiles of the young spike at eight developmental stages, revealing coordinated changes in chromatin accessibility and H3K27me3 abundance during the flowering transition. We constructed a core transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that drives wheat spike formation and experimentally validated a multi-layer regulatory module involving TaSPL15, TaAGLG1, and TaFUL2. By integrating the TRN with genome-wide association studies, we identified 227 transcription factors, including 42 with known functions and 185 with unknown functions. Further investigation of 61 novel transcription factors using multiple homozygous mutant lines revealed 36 transcription factors that regulate spike architecture or flowering time, such as TaMYC2-A1, TaMYB30-A1, and TaWRKY37-A1. Of particular interest, TaMYB30-A1, downstream of and repressed by WFZP, was found to regulate fertile spikelet number.

This study investigates 2628 putative endolysin genes identified in 183,298 bacteriophage genomes. Previously, bioinformatic approaches resulted in a database of 66 SAR endolysins. This manuscript almost doubles the list with 53 additional SAR endolysin candidates. Forty-eight of the putative SAR endolysins described in this study contained one muramidase catalytic domain, and five included additional cell wall-binding domains at the C-terminus. For the moment, SAR domains are found in four protein families: glycoside hydrolase family 19 (GH19), glycoside hydrolase family 24 (GH24), glycoside hydrolase family 25 (GH25), and glycoside hydrolase family 108 (GH108). These SAR lysis are clustered in eight groups based on biochemical properties and domain presence/absence. Therefore, in this study, we expand the arsenal of endolysin candidates that might act against Gram-negative bacteria and develop a consult database for antimicrobial proteins derived from bacteriophages.",bio-resource,0.99662495,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35525881,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.48738953,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40355755.0,The genetic interaction map of the human solute carrier superfamily.,"Solute carriers (SLCs), the largest superfamily of transporter proteins in humans with about 450 members, control the movement of molecules across membranes. A typical human cell expresses over 200 different SLCs, yet their collective influence on cell phenotypes is not well understood due to overlapping substrate specificities and expression patterns. To address this, we performed systematic pairwise gene double knockouts using CRISPR-Cas12a and -Cas9 in human colon carcinoma cells. A total of 1,088,605 guide combinations were used to interrogate 35,421 SLC-SLC and SLC-enzyme double knockout combinations across multiple growth conditions, uncovering 1236 genetic interactions with a growth phenotype. Further exploration of an interaction between the mitochondrial citrate/malate exchanger SLC25A1 and the zinc transporter SLC39A1 revealed an unexpected role for SLC39A1 in metabolic reprogramming and anti-apoptotic signaling. This full-scale genetic interaction map of human SLC transporters is the backbone for understanding the intricate functional network of SLCs in cellular systems and generates hypotheses for pharmacological target exploitation in cancer and other diseases.

38033626.0,Development of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid transfer gene database for enteric bacteria.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are integral parts of the conjugation process in enteric bacteria. These secretion systems are encoded within the transfer (<i>tra</i>) regions of plasmids, including those that harbor antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The conjugal transfer of resistance plasmids can lead to the dissemination of AMR among bacterial populations. <b>Methods:</b> To facilitate the analyses of the conjugation-associated genes, transfer related genes associated with key groups of AMR plasmids were identified, extracted from GenBank and used to generate a plasmid transfer gene dataset that is part of the Virulence and Plasmid Transfer Factor Database at FDA, serving as the foundation for computational tools for the comparison of the conjugal transfer genes. To assess the genetic feature of the transfer gene database, genes/proteins of the same name (e.g., <i>traI/</i>TraI) or predicted function (VirD4 ATPase homologs) were compared across the different plasmid types to assess sequence diversity. Two analyses tools, the Plasmid Transfer Factor Profile Assessment and Plasmid Transfer Factor Comparison tools, were developed to evaluate the transfer genes located on plasmids and to facilitate the comparison of plasmids from multiple sequence files. To assess the database and associated tools, plasmid, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data were extracted from GenBank and previous WGS experiments in our lab and assessed using the analysis tools. <b>Results:</b> Overall, the plasmid transfer database and associated tools proved to be very useful for evaluating the different plasmid types, their association with T4SSs, and increased our understanding how conjugative plasmids contribute to the dissemination of AMR genes.",bio-resource,0.9946432,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38033626,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.48695943,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38556547.0,Experimental capture of miRNA targetomes: disease-specific 3'UTR library-based miRNA targetomics for Parkinson's disease.,"The identification of targetomes remains a challenge given the pleiotropic effect of miRNAs, the limited effects of miRNAs on individual targets, and the sheer number of estimated miRNA-target gene interactions (MTIs), which is around 44,571,700. Currently, targetome identification for single miRNAs relies on computational evidence and functional studies covering smaller numbers of targets. To ensure that the targetome analysis could be experimentally verified by functional assays, we employed a systematic approach and explored the targetomes of four miRNAs (miR-129-5p, miR-129-1-3p, miR-133b, and miR-873-5p) by analyzing 410 predicted target genes, both of which were previously associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). After performing 13,536 transfections, we validated 442 of the 705 putative MTIs (62,7%) through dual luciferase reporter assays. These analyses increased the number of validated MTIs by at least 2.1-fold for miR-133b and by a maximum of 24.3-fold for miR-873-5p. Our study contributes to the experimental capture of miRNA targetomes by addressing i) the ratio of experimentally verified MTIs to predicted MTIs, ii) the sizes of disease-related miRNA targetomes, and iii) the density of MTI networks. A web service to support the analyses on the MTI level is available online ( https://ccb-web.cs.uni-saarland.de/utr-seremato ), and all the data have been added to the miRATBase database ( https://ccb-web.cs.uni-saarland.de/miratbase ).",bio-resource,0.52819186,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38556547,0.5,has_url; usage_kw=1,False,False,True,0,1,0,0.48685056,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

In total, we retrieved 6,305 unique articles of which 882 were included.ResultsIn total, 186 zoonotic pathogen species were described, including 90 bacteria, 42 helminths, 19 protozoa, 22 viruses and 15 fungi. Most of these pathogens were only studied in one single animal species. Even considering that some pathogens are relatively species-specific, many European countries have no (accessible) data on zoonotic pathogens in these relevant animal species. We used the Netherlands as an example to show how this database can be used by other countries to identify wildlife disease surveillance gaps on a national level. Only 4% of all potential host-pathogen combinations have been studied in the Netherlands.ConclusionsThis database comprises a comprehensive overview that can guide future research on wildlife-borne zoonotic diseases both on a European and national scale.

In the current research, four typing methods were initially compared, including multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), single-copy core genes phylogenetic analysis (SCCGPA), dispensable genes content pattern analysis (DGCPA) and composition vector tree (CVTree), to analyze the genomic variability of 23 <i>B. thuringiensis</i> strains from <i>aizawai</i>, <i>kurstaki</i>, <i>israelensis</i>, <i>thuringiensis</i> and <i>morrisoni</i> serovars. The CVTree method was the best option to be used for typing <i>B. thuringiensis</i> strains since it proved to be the fastest method, whilst giving high-resolution data about the strains. In addition, CVTree agrees well with ANI-based method, revealing the relationship between <i>B. thuringiensis</i> and other <i>B. cereus s.l.</i> species.

Phase 1 focused on the development of the repository. This entailed identifying videos, removing private information, developing codes for swallow events and bolus variables, transcribing videos, and uploading them to a publicly available site for easy access. Phase 2 assessed the usefulness of the repository as a research tool. In this phase, a group of graduate and undergraduate students investigated a research question of interest to them. Each phase incorporated a qualitative analysis to examine the challenges encountered in that given phase.<h4>Results</h4>An open-source data repository of swallow studies, called DysphagiaBank, was successfully developed and uploaded into the TalkBank data repository. The database was easily employed by both graduate and undergraduates to engage in research in a timely fashion. Across qualitative analysis, the single consistent barrier to success was the COVID-19 pandemic that impacted access to campus and adequate internet for streaming.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of an open-source data repository improved our students abilities to engage in research and enhanced their understanding of swallow physiology across the lifespan.",bio-resource,0.88666534,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37930430,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.48541802,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38907896.0,Full-Length Characterization of Novel HLA-DRB1 Alleles for Reference Database Submission.,"The prerequisite for successful HLA genotyping is the integrity of the large allele reference database IPD-IMGT/HLA. Consequently, it is in the laboratories' best interest that the data quality of submitted novel sequences is high. However, due to its long and variable length, the gene HLA-DRB1 presents the biggest challenge and as of today only 16% of the HLA-DRB1 alleles in the database are characterized in full length. To improve this situation, we developed a protocol for long-range PCR amplification of targeted HLA-DRB1 alleles. By subsequently combining both long-read and short-read sequencing technologies, our protocol ensures phased and error-corrected sequences of reference grade quality. This dual redundant reference sequencing (DR2S) approach is of particular importance for correctly resolving the challenging repeat regions of DRB1 intron 1. Until today, we used this protocol to characterize and submit 384 full-length HLA-DRB1 sequences to IPD-IMGT/HLA.",bio-resource,0.6929679,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38907896,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.48521093,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

40050712.0,Merging metabolomics and genomics provides a catalog of genetic factors that influence molecular phenotypes in pigs linking relevant metabolic pathways.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metabolomics opens novel avenues to study the basic biological mechanisms underlying complex traits, starting from characterization of metabolites. Metabolites and their levels in a biofluid represent simple molecular phenotypes (metabotypes) that are direct products of enzyme activities and relate to all metabolic pathways, including catabolism and anabolism of nutrients. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of merging metabolomics and genomics in pigs to uncover a large list of genetic factors that influence mammalian metabolism.<h4>Results</h4>We obtained targeted characterization of the plasma metabolome of more than 1300 pigs from two populations of Large White and Duroc pig breeds. The metabolomic profiles of these pigs were used to identify genetically influenced metabolites by estimating the heritability of the level of 188 metabolites. Then, combining breed-specific genome-wide association studies of single metabolites and their ratios and across breed meta-analyses, we identified a total of 97 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL), associated with 126 metabolites. Using these results, we constructed a human-pig comparative catalog of genetic factors influencing the metabolomic profile. Whole genome resequencing data identified several putative causative mutations for these mQTL. Additionally, based on a major mQTL for kynurenine level, we designed a nutrigenetic study feeding piglets that carried different genotypes at the candidate gene kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) varying levels of tryptophan and demonstrated the effect of this genetic factor on the kynurenine pathway. Furthermore, we used metabolomic profiles of Large White and Duroc pigs to reconstruct metabolic pathways using Gaussian Graphical Models, which included perturbation of the identified mQTL.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study has provided the first catalog of genetic factors affecting molecular phenotypes that describe the pig blood metabolome, with links to important metabolic pathways, opening novel avenues to merge genetics and nutrition in this livestock species. The obtained results are relevant for basic and applied biology and to evaluate the pig as a biomedical model. Genetically influenced metabolites can be further exploited in nutrigenetic approaches in pigs. The described molecular phenotypes can be useful to dissect complex traits and design novel feeding, breeding and selection programs in pigs.",bio-resource,0.98432946,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40050712,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.48309368,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

A systematic study of PM protein modulation by vaccinia virus (VACV), the paradigm of host regulation, has the potential to reveal not only novel viral immune evasion mechanisms, but also novel factors critical in host immunity. Here, >1000 PM proteins were quantified throughout VACV infection, revealing selective downregulation of known T and NK cell ligands including HLA-C, downregulation of cytokine receptors including IFNAR2, IL-6ST and IL-10RB, and rapid inhibition of expression of certain protocadherins and ephrins, candidate activating immune ligands. Downregulation of most PM proteins occurred via a proteasome-independent mechanism. Upregulated proteins included a decoy receptor for TRAIL. Twenty VACV-encoded PM proteins were identified, of which five were not recognised previously as such.

Therefore, efforts are needed to exploit available, high-quality resources. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) is a large-scale longitudinal cohort with great potential for rare cancer research.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We have used the EPIC data, which includes lifestyle, diet, and health information, on ∼520  000 participants recruited across Europe. Rare cancers were identified according to the RARE CAncer REgistry network (RARECAREnet) classification, which includes incidence-based categorization and detailed morphological and site-specific information.<h4>Results</h4>An interactive R Shiny web application was developed to explore EPIC data interactively, available at https://epic-rare-cancers-explorer.opendata.iarc.who.int. Among the EPIC participants, 11 450 incident cases of rare cancers were identified, with data currently available for 8851 of them, encompassing a wide range of cancer sites and morphologies. Sex ratios and incidence rates align with previously reported statistics. The R Shiny web application was designed for preliminary data analysis and hypothesis generation, aiding researchers in assessing the feasibility and potential of epidemiological studies. Taking head and neck cancers as a use case, we confirmed the strong association of these tumors with tobacco and alcohol consumption, proving the suitability of EPIC for identifying risk factors for rare cancers. However, it is important to note that, as with all observational studies, the associations reported in this article do not establish causality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The development of the EPIC rare cancers database, accompanied by the development of an interactive web application, represents a significant step forward in rare cancer research embedded within a large-scale population-based cohort.

It is a monocotyledonous halophyte, has salt glands, performs C4-type photosynthesis and has a close genetic relationship with cereal crops. Moreover, previous studies have shown its huge potential as a reservoir of genes and promoters to understand and improve abiotic stress tolerance in crops.<h4>Results</h4>The sequencing and hybrid assembly of the A. littoralis genome (2n = 2X = 20) using short and long reads from the BGISeq-500 and PacBio high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing platforms, respectively. Using the k-mer analysis method, the haploid genome size of A. littoralis was estimated to be 360 Mb (with a heterozygosity rate of 1.88%). The hybrid assembled genome included 4,078 contigs with a GC content of 44% and covered 348 Mb. The longest contig and the N50 values were 5.1 Mb and 133.77 kb, respectively. The Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Ortholog (BUSCO) value was 91.1%, indicating good integrity of the assembled genome. The discovered repetitive elements accounted for 90.6 Mb, representing 26.03% of the total genome, and included a significant component of transposable elements (11.48%, ~40 Mb). Using a homology-based approach, 35,147 genes were predicted from the genome assembly. We next focused our analysis on the zinc-finger A20/AN1 gene family, a member of which (AlSAP) was previously shown to confer increased tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses when it was over-expressed in tobacco, wheat, and rice. Here, we identified the complete set of members of this family in the Aeluropus littoralis genome, thereby laying the foundation for their future functional analysis in cereal crops. In addition, the expression patterns of four novel genes from this family were analyzed by qPCR.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This resource and our findings will contribute to improve the current understanding of salinity tolerance in halophytes while providing useful genes and allelic variation to improve salinity and drought tolerance in cereals through genetic engineering and gene editing, respectively.",bio-resource,0.5430653,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40295936,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.48136052,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

38928827.0,Raman-Activated Cell Ejection for Validating the Reliability of the Raman Fingerprint Database of Foodborne Pathogens.,"Raman spectroscopy for rapid identification of foodborne pathogens based on phenotype has attracted increasing attention, and the reliability of the Raman fingerprint database through genotypic determination is crucial. In the research, the classification model of four foodborne pathogens was established based on t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and support vector machine (SVM); the recognition accuracy was 97.04%. The target bacteria named by the model were ejected through Raman-activated cell ejection (RACE), and then single-cell genomic DNA was amplified for species analysis. The accuracy of correct matches between the predicted phenotype and the actual genotype of the target cells was at least 83.3%. Furthermore, all anticipant sequencing results brought into correspondence with the species were predicted through the model. In sum, the Raman fingerprint database based on Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning was reliable and promising in the field of rapid detection of foodborne pathogens.",bio-resource,0.55044836,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38928827,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.48058075,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36084720.0,"Comprehensive review of publicly available colonoscopic imaging databases for artificial intelligence research: availability, accessibility, and usability.","<h4>Background and aims</h4>Publicly available databases containing colonoscopic imaging data are valuable resources for artificial intelligence (AI) research. Currently, little is known regarding the available number and content of these databases. This review aimed to describe the availability, accessibility, and usability of publicly available colonoscopic imaging databases, focusing on polyp detection, polyp characterization, and quality of colonoscopy.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase to identify AI studies describing publicly available colonoscopic imaging databases published after 2010. Second, a targeted search using Google's Dataset Search, Google Search, GitHub, and Figshare was done to identify databases directly. Databases were included if they contained data about polyp detection, polyp characterization, or quality of colonoscopy. To assess accessibility of databases, the following categories were defined: open access, open access with barriers, and regulated access. To assess the potential usability of the included databases, essential details of each database were extracted using a checklist derived from the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 22 databases with open access, 3 databases with open access with barriers, and 15 databases with regulated access. The 22 open access databases contained 19,463 images and 952 videos. Nineteen of these databases focused on polyp detection, localization, and/or segmentation; 6 on polyp characterization, and 3 on quality of colonoscopy. Only half of these databases have been used by other researcher to develop, train, or benchmark their AI system. Although technical details were in general well reported, important details such as polyp and patient demographics and the annotation process were under-reported in almost all databases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This review provides greater insight on public availability of colonoscopic imaging databases for AI research. Incomplete reporting of important details limits the ability of researchers to assess the usability of current databases.",bio-resource,0.6955601,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36084720,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.48052678,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40138345.0,An atlas of protein phosphorylation dynamics during interferon signaling.,"Interferons (IFNs, types I-III) have pleiotropic functions in promoting antiviral and antitumor responses, as well as in modulating inflammation. Dissecting the signaling mechanisms elicited by different IFNs is therefore critical to understand their phenotypes. Here, we use mass spectrometry to investigate the early temporal dynamics of cellular protein phosphorylation in a human lung epithelial cell-line as it responds to stimulation with IFNα2, IFNβ, IFNω, IFNγ, or IFNλ1, representing all IFN types. We report an atlas of over 700 common or unique phosphorylation events reprogrammed by these different IFNs, revealing both previously known and uncharacterized modifications. While the proteins differentially phosphorylated following IFN stimulation have diverse roles, there is an enrichment of factors involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and RNA splicing. Functional screening and mechanistic studies identify that several proteins modified in response to IFNs contribute to host antiviral responses, either directly or by supporting IFN-stimulated gene or protein production. Among these, phosphorylation of PLEKHG3 at serine-1081 creates a phospho-regulated binding motif for the docking of 14-3-3 proteins, and together these factors contribute to coordinating efficient IFN-stimulated gene expression independent of early Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. Our findings map the global phosphorylation landscapes regulated by IFN types I, II, and III, and provide a key resource to explore their functional consequences.",bio-resource,0.9246486,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40138345,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.48027354,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

37790806.0,"The international clinical trials registry platform (ICTRP): data integrity and the trends in clinical trials, diseases, and drugs.","<b>Introduction:</b> Clinical trials are the gold standard for testing new therapies. Databases like ClinicalTrials.gov provide access to trial information, mainly covering the US and Europe. In 2006, WHO introduced the global ICTRP, aggregating data from ClinicalTrials.gov and 17 other national registers, making it the largest clinical trial platform by June 2019. This study conducts a comprehensive global analysis of the ICTRP database and provides framework for large-scale data analysis, data preparation, curation, and filtering. <b>Materials and methods:</b> The trends in 689,793 records from the ICTRP database (covering trials registered from 1990 to 2020) were analyzed. Records were adjusted for duplicates and mapping of agents to drug classes was performed. Several databases, including DrugBank, MESH, and the NIH Drug Information Portal were used to investigate trends in agent classes. <b>Results:</b> Our novel approach unveiled that 0.5% of the trials we identified were hidden duplicates, primarily originating from the EUCTR database, which accounted for 82.9% of these duplicates. However, the overall number of hidden duplicates within the ICTRP seems to be decreasing. In total, 689 793 trials (478 345 interventional) were registered in the ICTRP between 1990 and 2020, surpassing the count of trials in ClinicalTrials.gov (362 500 trials by the end of 2020). We identified 4 865 unique agents in trials with DrugBank, whereas 2 633 agents were identified with NIH Drug Information Portal data. After the ClinicalTrials.gov, EUCTR had the most trials in the ICTRP, followed by CTRI, IRCT, CHiCTR, and ISRCTN. CHiCTR displayed a significant surge in trial registration around 2015, while CTRI experienced rapid growth starting in 2016. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of using the ICTRP as a data source for analyzing trends in clinical trials, and emphasizes the value of utilizing multiple registries for a comprehensive analysis.",bio-resource,0.8744755,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37790806,-0.5,impl_kw=1; usage_kw=2,False,False,False,1,2,0,0.47857422,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35664224.0,MIAOME: Human microbiome affect the host epigenome.,"Besides the genetic factors having tremendous influences on the regulations of the epigenome, the microenvironmental factors have recently gained extensive attention for their roles in affecting the host epigenome. There are three major types of microenvironmental factors: microbiota-derived metabolites (MDM), microbiota-derived components (MDC) and microbiota-secreted proteins (MSP). These factors can regulate host physiology by modifying host gene expression through the three highly interconnected epigenetic mechanisms (<i>e.g.</i> histone modifications, DNA modifications, and non-coding RNAs). However, no database was available to provide the comprehensive factors of these types. Herein, a database entitled 'Human Microbiome Affect The Host Epigenome (MIAOME)' was constructed. Based on the types of epigenetic modifications confirmed in the literature review, the MIAOME database captures 1068 (63 genus, 281 species, 707 strains, <i>etc.</i>) human microbes, 91 unique microbiota-derived metabolites & components (16 fatty acids, 10 bile acids, 10 phenolic compounds, 10 vitamins, 9 tryptophan metabolites, <i>etc.</i>) derived from 967 microbes; 50 microbes that secreted 40 proteins; 98 microbes that directly influence the host epigenetic modification, and provides 3 classifications of the epigenome, including (1) 4 types of DNA modifications, (2) 20 histone modifications and (3) 490 ncRNAs regulations, involved in 160 human diseases. All in all, MIAOME has compiled the information on the microenvironmental factors influence host epigenome through the scientific literature and biochemical databases, and allows the collective considerations among the different types of factors.

35093167.0,EU health information progress: the harvest of policy supporting projects and networks.,"<h4>Background</h4>The European Commission supports the initiation of health information related projects and networks serving comparative population health monitoring and health system performance assessment. Many of these projects and networks have produced relevant data, standards, methods, indicators and knowledge that may be lost as these networks become inactive. The aim of this project retrieval and review was to identify health information projects and networks and their produced output; and subsequently facilitate systematic access to this information for policy makers, researchers and interested others via a web-based repository.<h4>Methods</h4>The scope of this article covers 1. population health oriented topics and 2. health system/health services oriented topics. Out of scope are specific infectious diseases; individual rare diseases; and the occurrence and effects of specific medical treatments, interventions and diagnostics; cohort studies; or studies focusing on research methods. We searched bibliographic databases and EU project databases for policy supporting projects and networks and selected those fulfilling our inclusion criteria after more in-depth inspection. We searched for their outputs. In addition, we reviewed country participation in these projects and networks.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 36 projects and networks, 16 of which are population health oriented, 6 are health systems and services oriented and 14 cover both. Their total volume of output is not easily retrievable, as many project websites have been discontinued. Some networks and/or their outputs have found continuance within European agencies and/or national institutions. Others are struggling or have gone lost, despite their policy relevance. Participation in the projects was not evenly distributed across Europe. Project information was made available through the Health Information Portal.<h4>Conclusions</h4>EU funded projects and networks have contributed greatly to the evidence-base for policy by providing comparative health information. However, more action is needed to evaluate and conserve their outputs and facilitate continued contribution to the field after project funding stops. The realization of a sustainable infrastructure for these projects and networks is urgent. The Health Information Portal can play an important role in conserving and reusing health information.

36427260.0,Universal Liver Imaging Lexicon: Imaging Atlas for Research and Clinical Practice.,"The use of standardized terms in assessing and reporting disease processes has well-established benefits, such as clear communication between radiologists and other health care providers, improved diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility, and the enhancement and facilitation of research. Recently, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) Steering Committee released a universal liver imaging lexicon. The current version of the lexicon includes 81 vetted and precisely defined terms that are relevant to acquisition of images using all major liver imaging modalities and contrast agents, as well as lesion- and organ-level features. Most terms in the lexicon are applicable to all patients undergoing imaging of the liver, and only a minority of the terms are strictly intended to be used for patients with high risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. This pictorial atlas familiarizes readers with the liver imaging lexicon and includes discussion of general concepts, providing sample definitions, schematics, and clinical examples for a subset of the terms in the liver imaging lexicon. The authors discuss general, technical, and imaging feature terms used commonly in liver imaging, with the goal of illustrating their use for clinical and research applications. <i>Work of the U.S. Government published under an exclusive license with the RSNA.</i> <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i>",bio-resource,0.5318571,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36427260,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.477393,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The CPLD links data from four major population-based public sources: the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database in the Korea Central Cancer Registry, cause-of-death data in Statistics Korea, the National Health Information Database in the National Health Insurance Service, and the National Health Insurance Research Database in the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service. These databases are linked using an encrypted resident registration number. The CPLD, established in 2022 and updated annually, comprises 1,983,499 men and women newly diagnosed with cancer between 2012 and 2019. It contains data on cancer registration and death, demographics, medical claims, general health checkups, and national cancer screening. The most common cancers among men in the CPLD were stomach (16.1%), lung (14.0%), colorectal (13.3%), prostate (9.6%), and liver (9.3%) cancers. The most common cancers among women were thyroid (20.4%), breast (16.6%), colorectal (9.0%), stomach (7.8%), and lung (6.2%) cancers. Among them, 571,285 died between 2012 and 2020 owing to cancer (89.2%) or other causes (10.8%). Upon approval, the CPLD is accessible to researchers through the K-CURE portal. The CPLD is a unique resource for diverse cancer research to investigate medical use before a cancer diagnosis, during initial diagnosis and treatment, and long-term follow-up.

38783923.0,Feasibility of implementing an integrated long-term database to advance ecosystem-based management in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin.,"The North American Great Lakes have been experiencing dramatic change during the past half-century, highlighting the need for holistic, ecosystem-based approaches to management. To assess interest in ecosystem-based management (EBM), including the value of a comprehensive public database that could serve as a repository for the numerous physical, chemical, and biological monitoring Great Lakes datasets that exist, a two-day workshop was organized, which was attended by 40+ Great Lakes researchers, managers, and stakeholders. While we learned during the workshop that EBM is not an explicit mission of many of the participating research, monitoring, and management agencies, most have been conducting research or monitoring activities that can support EBM. These contributions have ranged from single-resource (-sector) management to considering the ecosystem holistically in a decision-making framework. Workshop participants also identified impediments to implementing EBM, including: 1) high anticipated costs; 2) a lack of EBM success stories to garner agency buy-in; and 3) difficulty in establishing common objectives among groups with different mandates (e.g., water quality vs. fisheries production). We discussed as a group solutions to overcome these impediments, including construction of a comprehensive, research-ready database, a prototype of which was presented at the workshop. We collectively felt that such a database would offer a cost-effective means to support EBM approaches by facilitating research that could help identify useful ecosystem indicators and management targets and allow for management strategy evaluations that account for risk and uncertainty when contemplating future decision-making.",bio-resource,0.9313007,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38783923,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.47661367,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36794213.0,Collecting wild potato species (<i>Solanum</i> sect. Petota) in Peru to enhance genetic representation and fill gaps in <i>ex situ</i> collections.,"Crop wild relatives (CWRs) are important sources of novel genes, due to their high variability of response to biotic and abiotic stresses, which can be invaluable for crop genetic improvement programs. Recent studies have shown that CWRs are threatened by several factors, including changes in land-use and climate change. A large proportion of CWRs are underrepresented in genebanks, making it necessary to take action to ensure their long-term <i>ex situ</i> conservation. With this aim, 18 targeted collecting trips were conducted during 2017/2018 in the center of origin of potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.), targeting 17 diverse ecological regions of Peru. This was the first comprehensive wild potato collection in Peru in at least 20 years and encompassed most of the unique habitats of potato CWRs in the country. A total of 322 wild potato accessions were collected as seed, tubers, and whole plants for <i>ex situ</i> storage and conservation. They belonged to 36 wild potato species including one accession of <i>S. ayacuchense</i> that was not conserved previously in any genebank. Most accessions required regeneration in the greenhouse prior to long-term conservation as seed. The collected accessions help reduce genetic gaps in <i>ex situ</i> conserved germplasm and will allow further research questions on potato genetic improvement and conservation strategies to be addressed. These potato CWRs are available by request for research, training, and breeding purposes under the terms of the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) from the Instituto Nacional de Innovacion Agraria (INIA) and the International Potato Center (CIP) in Lima-Peru.",bio-resource,0.68513596,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36794213,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.47625527,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Although most previous studies have focused on the breast epithelial system<sup>4-6</sup>, many of the non-epithelial cell types remain understudied. Here we constructed the comprehensive Human Breast Cell Atlas (HBCA) at single-cell and spatial resolution. Our single-cell transcriptomics study profiled 714,331 cells from 126 women, and 117,346 nuclei from 20 women, identifying 12 major cell types and 58 biological cell states. These data reveal abundant perivascular, endothelial and immune cell populations, and highly diverse luminal epithelial cell states.

35751288.0,Development and analysis of a geospatial database for maritime spatial planning in Bangladesh.,"In this research we collect, prepare and analyze a geospatial database of maritime activities located in the northern Bay of Bengal with the final aim to simulate maritime spatial planning (MSP) - ready information source for future sectoral and multi-sector MSP in Bangladesh. The database is composed of 28 anthropogenic and environmental layers categorized into seven Blue Economy sectors. The database is analyzed with a set of geospatial models aimed at understanding the intensity distribution of human activities at sea and the potential marine use conflicts emerging from the aggregation of human activities. Ecological resources were characterized in terms of marine mammals, lobsters, commercially important and threatened fish species, and pelagic birds and mapped as biodiversity hotspots using geographic cluster analysis. Results show that the most intensely used sea areas are located along the northeastern coast of Bangladesh, as well as in the Swatch of No Ground (SoNG) area, with maximum Marine Use Intensity (MUI) scores ranging from 5 to 8. Offshore waters of Saint Martin's Island have higher MUI scores (≥ 5) as well. The pairwise spatial conflict analysis shows that nature protection sites particularly SoNG Marine Protected Area (MPA), Nijhum Dwip Marine Reserve (MR), and Saint Martin's Island MPA are exposed to the high Marine Use Conflicts (MUC) induced by fishing and shipping activities. Fishing operations generate the highest MUC value (MUC = 30) in SoNG MPA, whereas shipping activities produce the highest MUC value (MUC = 24) in Nijhum Dwip MR. Both of the MPAs exhibit 6 to 12 MUC scores induced by shipping. The proposed database together with the illustrated analytical techniques used in this study and key findings can provide the first understanding of the priorities for Ecosystem Based Management of Bangladesh's marine space and provide valuable insights on the urgency for MSP process in the country.

35568796.0,"ELaPro, a LOINC-mapped core dataset for top laboratory procedures of eligibility screening for clinical trials.","<h4>Background</h4>Screening for eligible patients continues to pose a great challenge for many clinical trials. This has led to a rapidly growing interest in standardizing computable representations of eligibility criteria (EC) in order to develop tools that leverage data from electronic health record (EHR) systems. Although laboratory procedures (LP) represent a common entity of EC that is readily available and retrievable from EHR systems, there is a lack of interoperable data models for this entity of EC. A public, specialized data model that utilizes international, widely-adopted terminology for LP, e.g. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®), is much needed to support automated screening tools.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study is to establish a core dataset for LP most frequently requested to recruit patients for clinical trials using LOINC terminology. Employing such a core dataset could enhance the interface between study feasibility platforms and EHR systems and significantly improve automatic patient recruitment.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a semi-automated approach to analyze 10,516 screening forms from the Medical Data Models (MDM) portal's data repository that are pre-annotated with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). An automated semantic analysis based on concept frequency is followed by an extensive manual expert review performed by physicians to analyze complex recruitment-relevant concepts not amenable to automatic approach.<h4>Results</h4>Based on analysis of 138,225 EC from 10,516 screening forms, 55 laboratory procedures represented 77.87% of all UMLS laboratory concept occurrences identified in the selected EC forms. We identified 26,413 unique UMLS concepts from 118 UMLS semantic types and covered the vast majority of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) disease domains.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Only a small set of common LP covers the majority of laboratory concepts in screening EC forms which supports the feasibility of establishing a focused core dataset for LP. We present ELaPro, a novel, LOINC-mapped, core dataset for the most frequent 55 LP requested in screening for clinical trials. ELaPro is available in multiple machine-readable data formats like CSV, ODM and HL7 FHIR. The extensive manual curation of this large number of free-text EC as well as the combining of UMLS and LOINC terminologies distinguishes this specialized dataset from previous relevant datasets in the literature.",bio-resource,0.58555573,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35568796,0.5,impl_kw=2; usage_kw=1,False,False,False,2,1,0,0.47531825,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37248633.0,An NLR integrated domain toolkit to identify plant pathogen effector targets.,"Plant immune receptors, known as NOD-like receptors (NLRs), possess unique integrated decoy domains that enable plants to attract pathogen effectors and initiate a specific immune response. The present study aimed to create a library of these integrated domains (IDs) and screen them with pathogen effectors to identify targets for effector virulence and NLR-effector interactions. This works compiles IDs found in NLRs from seven different plant species and produced a library of 78 plasmid clones containing a total of 104 IDs, representing 43 distinct InterPro domains. A yeast two-hybrid assay was conducted, followed by an in planta interaction test, using 32 conserved effectors from Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum type III. Through these screenings, three interactions involving different IDs (kinase, DUF3542, WRKY) were discovered interacting with two unrelated type III effectors (RipAE and PopP2). Of particular interest was the interaction between PopP2 and ID#85, an atypical WRKY domain integrated into a soybean NLR gene (GmNLR-ID#85). Using a Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy technique to detect protein-protein interactions in living plant cells, PopP2 was demonstrated to physically associate with ID#85 in the nucleus. However, unlike the known WRKY-containing Arabidopsis RRS1-R NLR receptor, GmNLR-ID#85 could not be acetylated by PopP2 and failed to activate RPS4-dependent immunity when introduced into the RRS1-R immune receptor. The generated library of 78 plasmid clones, encompassing these screenable IDs, is publicly available through Addgene. This resource is expected to be valuable for the scientific community with respect to discovering targets for effectors and potentially engineering plant immune receptors.",bio-resource,0.80458736,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37248633,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.4753142,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35616099.0,Translational drug-interaction corpus.,"The discovery of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that have a translational impact among in vitro pharmacokinetics (PK), in vivo PK and clinical outcomes depends largely on the quality of the annotated corpus available for text mining. We have developed a new DDI corpus based on an annotation scheme that builds upon and extends previous ones, where an abstract is fragmented and each fragment is then annotated along eight dimensions, namely, focus, polarity, certainty, evidence, directionality, study type, interaction type and mechanism. The guideline for defining these dimensions has undergone refinement during the annotation process. Our DDI corpus comprises 900 positive DDI abstracts and 750 that are not directly relevant to DDI. The abstracts in corpus are separated into eight categories of DDI or non-DDI evidence: DDI with pharmacokinetic (PK) mechanism, in vivo DDI PK, DDI clinical, drug-nutrition interaction, single drug, not drug related, in vitro pharmacodynamic (PD) and case report. Seven annotators, three annotators with drug-interaction research experience and four annotators with less drug-interaction research experience independently annotated the DDI corpus, where two researchers independently annotated each abstract. After two rounds of annotations with additional training in between, agreement improved from (0.79, 0.96, 0.86, 0.70, 0.91, 0.65, 0.78, 0.90) to (0.93, 0.99, 0.96, 0.94, 0.95, 0.93, 0.96, 0.97) for focus, certainty, evidence, study type, interaction type, mechanisms, polarity and direction, respectively. The novice-level annotators improved from 0.83 to 0.96, while the expert-level annotators stayed in high performance with some improvement, from 0.90 to 0.96. In summary, we achieved 96% agreement among each pair of annotators with regard to the eight dimensions.

39094712.0,"Construction of a Full-Length transcriptome resource for the African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus), a prototypical air-breathing Fish, based on isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq).","The African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) assumes significance in aquaculture, given its role as a farmed freshwater species with modified gill structures functioning as an air-breathing organ (ABO). To provide a scientific basis for further elucidating the air-breathing formation mechanism and deeply utilizing the genetic resources of Clarias gariepinus, we utilized the PacBio sequencing platform to acquire a comprehensive full-length transcriptome from five juvenile developmental stages and various adult tissues, including the ABO, gills, liver, skin, and muscle. We generated 25,766,688 high-quality reads, with an average length of 2,006 bp and an N50 of 2,241 bp. Following rigorous quality control, 34,890 (97.7 %) of the high-quality isoforms were mapped to the reference genome for gene and transcript annotation, yielding 387 novel isoforms and 14,614 new isoforms. Additionally, we identified 28,582 open reading frames, 48 SNPs, 5,464 variable splices, and 6,141 variable polyadenylation sites, along with 475 long non-coding RNAs. Many DEGs were involved with low oxygen GO terms and KEGG pathways, such as response to stimulus, biological regulation and catalytic activities. Furthermore, it was found that transcription factors such as zf-C2H2, Homeobox, bHLH, and MYB could underpin the African sharptooth catfish's developmental plasticity and its capacity to adapt its morphology and function to its environment. Through the comprehensive analysis of its genomic characteristics, it was found that the African sharptooth catfish has developed a series of unique respiratory adaptive mechanisms during the evolutionary process, These results not only advances the understanding of genetic adaptations to hypoxia in Clarias fish but also provides a valuable framework for future studies aimed at improving aquaculture practices,besides provide important references and inspirations for the evolution of aquatic organisms.",bio-resource,0.9755499,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39094712,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.47479954,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

38574826.0,Nutrition survey methods and food composition database update of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study.,"This study presents the nutrition survey methods and the updated food composition database for the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). The KoGES, which is the largest and longest cohort study in Korea, aims to identify genetic and environmental factors associated with chronic diseases. This study has collected dietary data using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and/or the 24-hour recall method. However, these dietary survey methods use different food composition databases, and their nutritional values are out of date. Therefore, it became necessary to update the food composition database by revising nutrient analysis values to reflect improvements in the performance of food ingredient analysis equipment, revising international values to analysis values of Korean agricultural products, adjusting nutrient units, and adding newly reported nutrients related to chronic diseases. For this purpose, we integrated the different food composition databases used in each nutrition survey, updated 23 nutrients, and expanded 48 new nutrients for 3,648 food items using the latest reliable food composition databases published by national and international institutions. This revised food composition database may help to clarify the relationship between various nutrients and chronic diseases. It could serve as a valuable resource for nutritional, epidemiological, and genomic research and provide a basis for determining public health policies.",bio-resource,0.9856058,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38574826,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.47333857,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

It has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine, with demonstrated efficacy against various health conditions. However, the limited genomic data and knowledge of genetic variation have hindered its comprehensive exploration, utilization and conservation. In this study, we undertook low-coverage whole genome sequencing of diverse <i>D. nipponica</i> accessions to develop both plastome (including whole plastome sequences, plastome-derived SSRs and plastome-divergent hotspots) and nuclear genomic resources (including polymorphic nuclear SSRs and single-copy nuclear genes), as well as elucidate the intraspecific phylogeny of this species.

38720282.0,Opportunity and accessibility: an environmental scan of publicly available data repositories to address disparities in healthcare decision-making.,"<h4>Background</h4>Health disparities, starkly exposed and exacerbated by coronavirus disease 2019, pose a significant challenge to healthcare system access and health outcomes. Integrating health inequalities into health technology assessment calls for robust analytical methodologies utilizing disaggregated data to investigate and quantify the scope of these disparities. However, a comprehensive summary of population datasets that can be used for this purpose is lacking. The objective of this review was to identify publicly accessible health inequalities data repositories that are potential resources for healthcare decision-making and future health technology assessment submissions.<h4>Methods</h4>An environmental scan was conducted in June of 2023 of six international organizations (World Health Organization, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Eurostat, United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and World Bank) and 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. The official websites of 42 jurisdictions, excluding non-English websites and those lacking English translations, were reviewed. Screening and data extraction were performed by two reviewers for each data repository, including health indicators, determinants of health, and health inequality metrics. The results were narratively synthesized.<h4>Results</h4>The search identified only a limited number of country-level health inequalities data repositories. The World Health Organization Health Inequality Data Repository emerged as the most comprehensive source of health inequality data. Some country-level data repositories, such as Canada's Health Inequality Data Tool and England's Health Inequality Dashboard, offered rich local insights into determinants of health and numerous health status indicators, including mortality. Data repositories predominantly focused on determinants of health such as age, sex, social deprivation, and geography.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Interactive interfaces featuring data exploration and visualization options across diverse patient populations can serve as valuable tools to address health disparities. The data they provide may help inform complex analytical methodologies that integrate health inequality considerations into healthcare decision-making.

40169596.0,A multiomics dataset of paired CT image and plasma cell-free DNA end motif for patients with pulmonary nodules.,"Diagnosing lung cancer at a curable stage offers the opportunity for a favorable prognosis. The emerging epigenomics analysis on plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA), including 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modifications, has acted as a promising approach facilitating the identification of lung cancer. And, integrating 5mC biomarker with chest computed tomography (CT) image features could optimize the diagnosis of lung cancer, exceeding the performance of models built on single feature. However, the clinical applicability of integrated markers might be limited by the potential risk of overfitting due to small sample size. Hence, we prospectively collected peripheral blood sample and the paired chest CT images of 2032 patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules across 5 centers, and constructed a large-scale, multi-institutional, multiomics database that encompass CT imaging data and plasma cfDNA fragmentomic in 5mC-, 5hmC-enriched regions.

Although previous studies have investigated the heart proteome, the full hierarchical molecular network at cell-type- and region-resolved level, illustrating the specialized roles and crosstalk among different cell-types and regions, remains unclear. Here, we presented an atlas of cell-type-resolved proteome for mouse heart and region-resolved proteome for both mouse and human hearts. In-depth proteomic analysis identified 11,794 proteins across four cell-types and 11,995 proteins across six regions of the mouse heart. To further illustrate protein expression patterns in both physiological and pathological conditions, we conducted proteomic analysis on human heart samples from four regions with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We quantified 8201 proteins in DCM tissue and 8316 proteins in adjacent unaffected myocardium tissue across the four human heart regions. Notably, we found that the retinoic acid synthesis pathway was significantly enriched in the DCM-affected left ventricle, and functional experiments demonstrated that all-trans retinoic acid efficiently rescued Ang II-induced myocardial hypertrophy and transverse aorta constriction-induced heart failure. In conclusion, our datasets uncovered the functional features of different cell-types and their synergistic cooperation centered by cell-type-specific transcription factors (TFs) in different regions, while these TF-TG (target gene) axes were significantly altered in DCM. Additionally, all-trans retinoic acid was demonstrated to be an efficient treatment for heart failure.

However, lacking comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic data has impeded research progress. This study aims to fill this gap through an extensive transcriptomic analysis of M. terminalis.<h4>Methods and results</h4>We utilized PacBio Isoform Sequencing to generate 558,998 subreads, totaling 45.52 Gb, which yielded 22,141 transcripts after rigorous filtering and clustering. Complementary Illumina short-read sequencing corrected 967,114 errors across these transcripts. Our analysis identified 12,426 non-redundant isoforms, with 11,872 annotated in various databases. Functional annotation indicated 11,841 isoforms matched entries in the NCBI non-redundant protein sequences database. Gene Ontology analysis categorized 10,593 isoforms, revealing strong associations with cellular processes and binding functions. Additionally, 8203 isoforms were mapped to pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, highlighting significant involvement in immune system processes and complement cascades. We notably identified key immune molecules such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and complement component 3, each with multiple isoforms, underscoring their potential roles in the immune response. Our analysis also uncovered 853 alternative splicing events, predominantly involving retained introns, along with 672 transcription factors and 426 long non-coding RNAs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The high-quality reference transcriptome generated in this study provides a valuable resource for comparative genomic studies within the Megalobrama genus, supporting future research to enhance aquaculture stocks.",bio-resource,0.90485495,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39470845,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.46838,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38163545.0,"Reference gene catalog and metagenome-assembled genomes from the gut microbiome reveal the microbial composition, antibiotic resistome, and adaptability of a lignocellulose diet in the giant panda.","The giant panda, a strict herbivore that feeds on bamboo, still retains a typical carnivorous digestive system. Reference catalogs of microbial genes and genomes are lacking, largely limiting the antibiotic resistome and functional exploration of the giant panda gut microbiome. Here, we integrated 177 fecal metagenomes of captive and wild giant pandas to construct a giant panda integrated gene catalog (GPIGC) comprised of approximately 4.5 million non-redundant genes and reconstruct 393 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Taxonomic and functional characterization of genes revealed that the captivity of the giant panda significantly changed the core microbial composition and the distribution of microbial genes. Higher abundance and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected in the guts of captive giant pandas, and ARG distribution was influenced by geography, for both captive and wild individuals. Escherichia, as the prevalent genus in the guts of captive giant pandas, was the main carrier of ARGs, meaning there is a high risk of ARG transmission by Escherichia. We also found that multiple mcr gene variants, conferring plasmid-mediated mobile colistin resistance, were widespread in the guts of captive and wild giant pandas. There were low proportions of carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes in GPIGC and MAGs compared with several omnivorous and herbivorous mammals. Many members of Clostridium MAGs were significantly enriched in the guts of adult, old and wild giant pandas. The genomes of isolates and MAGs of Clostridiaceae harbored key genes or enzymes in complete pathways for degrading lignocellulose and producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indicating the potential of these bacteria to utilize the low-nutrient bamboo diet.

36399059.0,Improved microbial genomes and gene catalog of the chicken gut from metagenomic sequencing of high-fidelity long reads.,"<h4>Background</h4>Due to the importance of chicken production and the remarkable influence of the gut microbiota on host health and growth, tens of thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) have been constructed for the chicken gut microbiome. However, due to the limitations of short-read sequencing and assembly technologies, most of these MAGs are far from complete, are of lower quality, and include contaminant reads.<h4>Results</h4>We generated 332 Gb of high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads from the 5 chicken intestinal compartments and assembled 461 and 337 microbial genomes, of which 53% and 55% are circular, at the species and strain levels, respectively. For the assembled microbial genomes, approximately 95% were regarded as complete according to the ""RNA complete"" criteria, which requires at least 1 full-length ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operon encoding all 3 types of rRNA (16S, 23S, and 5S) and at least 18 copies of full-length transfer RNA genes. In comparison with the short-read-derived chicken MAGs, 384 (83% of 461) and 89 (26% of 337) strain-level and species-level genomes in this study are novel, with no matches to previously reported sequences. At the gene level, one-third of the 2.5 million genes in the HiFi-derived gene catalog are novel and cannot be matched to the short-read-derived gene catalog. Moreover, the HiFi-derived genomes have much higher continuity and completeness, as well as lower contamination; the HiFi-derived gene catalog has a much higher ratio of complete gene structures. The dominant phylum in our HiFi-assembled genomes was Firmicutes (82.5%), and the foregut was highly enriched in 5 genera: Ligilactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, Weissella, and Enterococcus, all of which belong to the order Lactobacillales. Using GTDB-Tk, all 337 species-level genomes were successfully classified at the order level; however, 2, 35, and 189 genomes could not be classified into any known family, genus, and species, respectively. Among these incompletely classified genomes, 9 and 49 may belong to novel genera and species, respectively, because their 16S rRNA genes have identities lower than 95% and 97% to any known 16S rRNA genes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HiFi sequencing not only produced metagenome assemblies and gene structures with markedly improved quality but also recovered a substantial portion of novel genomes and genes that were missed in previous short-read-based metagenome studies. The novel genomes and species obtained in this study will facilitate gut microbiome and host-microbiota interaction studies, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of poultry resources.",bio-resource,0.90458536,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36399059,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.46792492,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Therefore, the persistent development of natural antibacterial agents has become essential work. The present essay attempts to establish a systematic antibacterial activity database to instruct the food application of brevilaterins, promising antibacterial lipopeptides from <i>Brevibacillus laterosporus</i> S62-9. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were systematically collected from 43 species of standard bacteria and 140 strains of isolated bacteria (food spoilage bacteria and antibiotic-resistant bacteria) using a broth dilution method. The results showed that brevilaterins performed a broad-spectrum inhibitory (0.5~128 μg/mL) and bactericidal activity (1~256 μg/mL), especially efficient against Gram-positive bacteria and spoilage bacteria from grain products. Moreover, brevilaterins not only inhibit and kill multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria but do not readily develop resistance, with a small specific value of MBC/MIC (1~8). Furthermore, brevilaterins would interact with negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulfate and bind amphipathic soybean phospholipid with an affinity constant of <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> = 4.70 × 10<sup>-4</sup> M. No significant activity difference was found between brevilaterin B and brevilaterin C. Collectively, this work contributed rich antibacterial data of brevilaterins and revealed the antibacterial regularity beneath these data, which can be used as an activity handbook to instruct their application in food safety.",bio-resource,0.97775775,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36230066,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.46739072,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39393810.0,A convenient and versatile culturomics platform to expand the human gut culturome of Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae.,"The human gut microbiota is increasingly being recognised to play an important role in maintaining health. The families Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae in particular, are often reduced in disease states but are relatively poorly represented in culture collections. Cultured representatives are required to investigate the physiology and host interactions of gut microbes. Establishing cultured isolate collections can be laborious and expensive owing to the fastidious growth requirements of these organisms and the costs associated with taxonomic classification. This study proposes a culturomics platform combining a single basal culture medium with matrix-assisted laser adsorption/ionisation coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for fast and reliable isolation and identification of hundreds of novel isolates. In this study, basal YCFA medium supplemented with either glucose, apple pectin, or porcine mucin was used to cultivate a total of 724 different isolates derived from only 11 different faecal samples from healthy volunteers, of which 389 isolates belonged to the Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae families. Moreover, 27 isolates could not be assigned to known species based on their 16S rRNA gene, 17 of which may even represent novel genera. To aid MALDI-TOF MS identification of gut bacteria, the commercial database was complemented with the MaldiGut database presented here, containing a collection of 132 different Main Spectrum Profiles, including the profiles of 125 Firmicutes species, 3 Bacteroidetes species, 3 Actinobacteria species, and one Verrucomicrobia species.

35587493.0,"Establishing and using a genetic database for resolving identification of fish species in the Sea of Galilee, Israel.","Freshwaters are a very valuable resource in arid areas, such as Mediterranean countries. Freshwater systems are vulnerable ecological habitats, significantly disturbed globally and especially in arid areas. The Sea of Galilee is the largest surface freshwater body in the Middle East. It is an isolated habitat supporting unique fish populations, including endemic species and populations on the edge of their distribution range. Using the Sea of Galilee for water supply, fishing and recreation has been placing pressure on these fish populations. Therefore, efficient monitoring and effective actions can make a difference in the conservation of these unique fish populations. To set a baseline and develop molecular tools to do so, in this study, DNA barcoding was used to establish a database of molecular species identification based on sequences of Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I gene. DNA barcodes for 22 species were obtained and deposited in Barcode of Life Database. Among these, 12 barcodes for 10 species were new to the database and different from those already there. Barcode sequences were queried against the database and similar barcodes from the same and closely related species were obtained. Disagreements between morphological and molecular species identification were identified for five species, which were further studied by phylogenetic and genetic distances analyses.

35701103.0,The International Fragile X Premutation Registry: building a resource for research and clinical trial readiness.,"<i>FMR1</i> premutation cytosine-guanine-guanine repeat expansion alleles are relatively common mutations in the general population that are associated with a neurodegenerative disease (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome), reproductive health problems and potentially a wide range of additional mental and general health conditions that are not yet well-characterised. The International Fragile X Premutation Registry (IFXPR) was developed to facilitate and encourage research to better understand the <i>FMR1</i> premutation and its impact on human health, to facilitate clinical trial readiness by identifying and characterising diverse cohorts of individuals interested in study participation, and to build community and collaboration among carriers, family members, researchers and clinicians around the world. Here, we describe the development and content of the IFXPR, characterise its first 747 registrants from 32 countries and invite investigators to apply for recruitment support for their project(s). With larger numbers, increased diversity and potentially the future clinical characterisation of registrants, the IFXPR will contribute to a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the fragile X premutation in human health and support treatment studies.",bio-resource,0.9876567,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35701103,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.4671854,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37623194.0,The Danish Trauma Database for Refugees (DTD): A Multicenter Database Collaboration-Overcoming the Challenges and Enhancing Mental Health Treatment and Research for Refugees.,"Mental health of trauma-affected refugees is an understudied area, resulting in inadequate and poorer treatment outcomes. To address this, more high-quality treatment studies that include predictive analyses, long-term evaluations, cultural adaptations, and take account for comorbidities, are needed. Moreover, given the complex intertwining of refugees' health with post-migration stressors and other social factors, it is crucial to examine the social determinants of refugee mental health. The Danish Trauma Database for Refugees (DTD) is a multicenter research database uniting six national centers that provide outpatient treatment for trauma-affected refugees. Through the database, we collect clinical and sociodemographic data from approximately 1200 refugees annually and will merge the database with Danish population register data. The purpose of the DTD is two-fold; clinical and research. The DTD offers data-driven guidance for routine clinical treatment planning of the individual patient, as well as exceptional research opportunities for testing treatment interventions in clinical settings, with larger sample sizes, and more representative heterogeneity of the population. Complex analyses of risk and protective factors, barriers, access to treatment, and societal and transgenerational aspects of trauma are possible with the DTD. This conceptual paper introduces the DTD, the historical background, the development process and implementation strategy, and the associated challenges with developing and running a multicenter database. Most importantly, it highlights the clinical and research potential of the DTD for advancing the understanding and treatment of trauma-affected refugees.",bio-resource,0.9412668,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37623194,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.46675757,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

39500943.0,Leveraging a comprehensive unbiased RNAseq database to characterize human monocyte-derived macrophage gene expression profiles within commonly employed in vitro polarization methods.,"Macrophages are pivotal innate immune cells which exhibit high phenotypic plasticity and can exist in different polarization states dependent on exposure to external stimuli. Numerous methods have been employed to simulate macrophage polarization states to test their function in vitro. However, limited research has explored whether these polarization methods yield comparable populations beyond key gene, cytokine, and cell surface marker expression. Here, we employ an unbiased comprehensive analysis using data organized through the all RNA-seq and ChIP-seq sample and signature search (ARCHS<sup>4</sup>) database, which compiles all RNAseq data deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). In silico analyses were carried out demonstrating that commonly employed macrophage polarization methods generate distinct gene expression profiles in macrophage subsets that remained poorly described until now. Our analyses confirm existing knowledge on broad macrophage polarization, while expanding nuanced differences between M2a and M2c subsets, suggesting non-interchangeable stimuli for M2a polarization. Furthermore, we characterize divergent gene expression patterns in M1 macrophages following standard polarization protocols, indicating significant subset distinctions. Consequently, equivalence cannot be assumed among polarization regimens for in vitro macrophage studies, particularly in simulating diverse pathogen responses.",bio-resource,0.9844795,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39500943,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.46226647,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40061803.0,Mining the cucumber core collection: phenotypic and genetic characterization of morphological diversity for fruit quality characteristics.,"Commercial value of cucumber is primarily driven by fruit quality. However, breeding goals frequently focus on production constraints caused by biotic and abiotic stresses. As sources of resistances are often present in unadapted germplasm, we sought to provide morphological and genetic information characterizing the diversity of fruit quality traits present in the CucCAP cucumber core collection. These 388 accessions representing >96% of the genetic diversity for cucumber present in the US National Plant Germplasm System harbor important sources of resistances and extensive morphological diversity. Data were collected for skin color, length/diameter ratio (L/D), tapering, curvature, and spine density for young fruits [5-7 days postpollination (dpp)], and length, diameter, L/D, skin color, netting, seed cavity size, flesh thickness, hollowness, and flesh color for mature fruits (30-40 dpp). Significant associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with each trait were identified from genome-wide association studies. In several cases, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for highly correlated traits were closely clustered. Principal component analysis, driven primarily by the highly correlated traits of fruit length, young and mature L/D ratios, and curvature showed a clear divergence of East Asian accessions. Significant SNPs contributing to the longest fruits, including development-stage specific QTL, were distributed across multiple chromosomes, indicating broad genomic effects of selection. Many of the SNPs identified for the various morphological traits were in close vicinity to previously identified fruit trait QTL and candidate genes, while several novel genes potentially important for these traits were also identified.",bio-resource,0.62913084,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40061803,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.46180582,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

TargetScan and miRanda databases were combined for the prediction and differential expression of mRNA-binding microRNAs (miRNA). The miRcode and starBase databases were used to predict miRNAs that bind to differentially expressed lncRNAs and circRNAs repectively. The relevant mRNA, circRNA, lncRNA and their corresponding miRNA prediction data were imported into Cytoscape software for visualization of the ceRNA network. The R language and KEGG Orthology-based Annotation System (KOBAS) were used to execute and illustrate the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Hub genes were identified using The CytoHubba plugin.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-one differentially expressed mRNAs, 17 differentially expressed lncRNAs, and 24 differentially expressed circRNAs were screened. Cytoscape software was used to construct the ceRNA network with nine mRNA nodes, two lncRNA nodes, eight circRNA nodes, and 51 miRNA nodes. Both GO and KEGG were focused on the Spliceosome pathway, indicating that spliceosomes are closely linked with the development of OC, while heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and RNA binding motif protein X-linked genes were the top 10 score Hub genes screened by Cytoscape software, including two lncRNAs, four mRNAs, and four circRNAs. In patients with OC, the expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 2 (EIF4G2), SERPINE 1 mRNA binding protein 1 (SERBP1), ribosomal protein L15 (RPL15) and human leukocyte antigen complex P5 (HCP5) was significantly higher whereas that of testis expressed transcript, Y-linked 15 and DEAD-box helicase 3 Y-linked genes was lower compared to normal controls Immunocorrelation scores revealed that SERBP1 was significantly and negatively correlated with endothelial cells and CD4+ T cells and positively correlated with natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, respectively; RPL15 was significantly positively correlated with macrophages and endothelial cells and negatively correlated with CD8+ T cells and uncharacterized cells, respectively. EIF4G2 was significantly and negatively correlated with endothelial cells and CD4+ T cells, and positively correlated with uncharacterized cells, respectively. Based on the survival data and the significant correlation characteristics derived from the multifactorial Cox analysis (P < 0.05), the survival prediction curves demonstrated that the prognostic factors associated with 3-year survival in patients with OC were The prognostic factors associated with survival were Macrophage, RPL15.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study successfully constructs a ceRNA regulatory network in blood exosomes of OV patients, which provides the specific targets for diagnosis and treatment of OC.",bio-resource,0.92156893,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38603733,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.4615692,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37034094.0,Current status and future aspects in the Japan Stroke Data Bank.,"The Japanese National Plan for the Promotion of Measures Against Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Diseases was formulated on October 27, 2020. One purpose of this plan was to promote research on cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the actual status of stroke treatment in Japan and operate a national stroke database with high public interest completely and accurately. The Japan Stroke Data Bank (JSDB; https://strokedatabank.ncvc.go.jp/en/) was established by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Scientific Research in Shimane University (Shimane, Japan) in 1999 and was transferred to the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (Osaka, Japan) as a part of the Cardiovascular Disease Registry in 2015. More than 200,000 of stroke cases have been registered using individual forms from more than 100 nationwide stroke centers over ~20 years. Since there are few large-scale stroke registries with nationwide coverage in Asia, including Japan, compared with those in Europe and North America, the role of the JSDB in the plan will be important in the future. To construct a high-quality stroke registry, we aimed to (1) collect detailed data through individual questionnaires for each participating stroke center, (2) link to external databases (e.g., insurance claims and public death registries), (3) improve the quality of treatment at participating hospitals through benchmarking, and (4) obtain stable funding through sustained support from government and academic societies.

37610900.0,A Very Large Cardiac Channel Data Database (VLCD) Used to Evaluate Global Image Coherence (GIC) as an In Vivo Image Quality Metric.,"Ultrasound image quality is of utmost importance for a clinician to reach a correct diagnosis. Conventionally, image quality is evaluated using metrics to determine the contrast and resolution. These metrics require localization of specific regions and targets in the image such as a region of interest (ROI), a background region, and/or a point scatterer. Such objects can all be difficult to identify in in-vivo images, especially for automatic evaluation of image quality in large amounts of data. Using a matrix array probe, we have recorded a Very Large cardiac Channel data Database (VLCD) to evaluate coherence as an in vivo image quality metric. The VLCD consists of 33280 individual image frames from 538 recordings of 106 patients. We also introduce a global image coherence (GIC), an in vivo image quality metric that does not require any identified ROI since it is defined as an average coherence value calculated from all the data pixels used to form the image, below a preselected range. The GIC is shown to be a quantitative metric for in vivo image quality when applied to the VLCD. We demonstrate, on a subset of the dataset, that the GIC correlates well with the conventional metrics contrast ratio (CR) and the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) with R = 0.74 ( ) and R = 0.62 ( ), respectively. There exist multiple methods to estimate the coherence of the received signal across the ultrasound array. We further show that all coherence measures investigated in this study are highly correlated ( 0.9 and ) when applied to the VLCD. Thus, even though there are differences in the implementation of coherence measures, all quantify the similarity of the signal across the array and can be averaged into a GIC to evaluate image quality automatically and quantitatively.",bio-resource,0.8741357,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37610900,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.45939165,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35928399.0,Exploring the diversity and genetic structure of the U.S. National Cultivated Strawberry Collection.,"The cultivated strawberry (<i>Fragaria</i> ×<i>ananassa</i>) arose through a hybridization of two wild American octoploid strawberry species in a French garden in the 1750s. Since then, breeders have developed improved cultivars adapted to different growing regions. Diverse germplasm is crucial to meet the challenges strawberry breeders will continue to address. The USDA-ARS National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR) in Corvallis, Oregon maintains the U.S. strawberry collection. Recent developments in high-throughput genotyping for strawberry can provide new insights about the diversity and structure of the collection, germplasm management, and future breeding strategies. Genotyping was conducted on 539 <i>F.</i> ×<i>ananassa</i> accessions using either the iStraw35 or FanaSNP 50 K Axiom array. Data for markers shared by the two arrays were curated for call quality, missing data, and minor allele frequency resulting in 4033 markers for structure assessment, diversity analysis, pedigree confirmation, core collection development, and the identification of haplotypes associated with desirable traits. The <i>F.</i> ×<i>ananassa</i> collection was equally diverse across the different geographic regions represented. K-means clustering, sNMF, and UPGMA hierarchal clustering revealed seven to nine sub-populations associated with different geographic breeding centers. Two 100 accession core collections were created. Pedigree linkages within the collection were confirmed. Finally, accessions containing disease resistance-associated haplotypes for <i>FaRCa1</i>, <i>FaRCg1</i>, <i>FaRMp1</i>, and <i>FaRPc2</i> were identified. These new core collections will allow breeders and researchers to more efficiently utilize the <i>F.</i> ×<i>ananassa</i> collection.

40089739.0,A scoping review of human genetic resources management policies and databases in high- and middle-low-income countries.,"<h4>Background</h4>This review examines global human genetic resources management, focusing on genetic data policies and repositories in high- and middle-low-income countries.<h4>Methods</h4>A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases, including official government websites and Google, to gather relevant literature on human genetic resources management policies and genetic resource databases. Documents were screened for relevance, focusing on high-income countries (United States, United Kingdom, Japan) and middle-low-income countries (China, India, Kenya). Data were extracted, coded, and analyzed to identify common themes and differences in genetic resource management practices.<h4>Results</h4>High-income countries benefit from robust legal frameworks and advanced technological infrastructures. The United States enforces the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to protect privacy and facilitate data sharing, while Japan relies on the Act on the Protection of Personal Information and ethical guidelines. Additionally, high-income countries host a variety of genetic databases and biobanks that support scientific research. In contrast, middle-low-income countries like China, India, and Kenya are still developing their frameworks. China has regulations such as the Biosecurity Law and the Regulations on the Management of Human Genetic Resources, but still requires more unified standards. India's policies focus on genetic research and data protection through the Biological Diversity Act, while Kenya seeks to improve data management through the 2019 Data Protection Act.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Significant disparities exist in human genetic resources management between high-income and middle-low-income countries. High-income countries have robust systems balancing privacy protection with research facilitation, supported by comprehensive and large-scale databases for scientific research. Middle-low-income countries need to enhance legal frameworks and build population-specific databases. Promoting equitable data sharing and adopting best practices from high-income countries are essential for advancing global scientific discovery and ensuring fair management of genetic resources.",bio-resource,0.62570316,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40089739,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.45722476,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

39614172.0,A catalog of gene editing sites and genetic variations in editing sites in model organisms.,"<h4>Background</h4>CRISPR-Cas systems require a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which plays an essential role in self/non-self discrimination in their natural context, to cleave DNA for genome editing. Unfortunately, common genetic variation is distributed throughout genomes, which can block recognition of target sites by Cas proteins. However, little information is available about the distribution of editing sites in model organisms and how often common variation overlaps with those PAM sites.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, we characterized six representative Cas proteins (Cas9, Cas12a, Cas12b, Cas12i, Cas12j and Cas12l) genomic editing sites in ten model organisms (yeast, flatworms, flies, zebrafish, mice, humans, rice, maize, Arabidopsis and tomato). We demonstrated that there were more than 34 editing sites per kilobase on average in these genomes. In each genome, 91.69-99.83% and 95.4-99.73% of genes had at least one unique editing site in exon and promoter, respectively. Depending on publicly available genomic diversity data, we identified the variations (SNPs and InDels) in editing sites in humans and rice, indicating the risk in the application of CRISPR/Cas technology. Finally, using CCR5 and BCL11A as examples, we revealed variation site was a factor that must be considered when designing sgRNA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings not only revealed the distribution characteristics of editing sites of six representative Cas proteins in ten model organism genomes but also shed light on the adverse effect of variation sites on target site recognition. Our current work will serve as a reminder of the risks of CRISPR application.",bio-resource,0.95585454,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39614172,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.4552011,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39003735.0,An atlas of GPCRs in dopamine neurons: Identification of the free fatty acid receptor 4 as a regulator of food and water intake.,"Midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DANs) are subject to extensive metabotropic regulation, but the repertoire of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) present in these neurons has not been mapped. Here, we isolate DANs from Dat-eGFP mice to generate a GPCR atlas by unbiased qPCR array expression analysis of 377 GPCRs. Combined with data mining of scRNA-seq databases, we identify multiple receptors in DAN subpopulations with 38 of these receptors representing the majority of transcripts. We identify 41 receptors expressed in midbrain DANs but not in non-DAN midbrain cells, including the free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4). Functional expression of FFAR4 is validated by ex vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, and in vivo experiments support that FFAR4 negatively regulates food and water intake and bodyweight. In addition to providing a critical framework for understanding metabotropic DAN regulation, our data suggest fatty acid sensing by FFAR4 as a mechanism linking high-energy intake to the dopamine-reward pathway.",bio-resource,0.54941034,1,1,0.7456,1,1,39003735,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.45504358,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The dataset was based on the bibliography used by Arndt et al. (2022) but expanded to also include more recent studies published from 2019 to 2023. All articles were identified for inclusion in the dataset using the ""Web of Science Core Collection"", the ""Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau International (CABI)"", and the ""EBSCO Discovery Service"" databases with the search terms ""methane"" and ""enteric"" in combination with ""beef"", ""cattle"", ""rumen"", and ""ruminant"". Additionally, the search term ""rumen"" was used in combination with ""energy balance"", ""energy metabolism"", or ""energy partitioning"". For dataset inclusion, it was necessary for all studies to be written in English and at a minimum, quantify feed dry matter intake and enteric methane emissions as well as provide measures of variance for these estimates. Studies were primarily designed as completely randomized, randomized block, or crossover experiments. The dataset includes 895 records (rows) and 138 variables (columns). Reported variables include publication information, experimental design, animal description, methane measurement method, diet nutrient composition, and means and measures of variance for feed dry matter intake and enteric methane emissions. Additionally, depending on the study, data reported on rumen fermentation parameters, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen excretion, weight gain, and carbon dioxide and hydrogen emissions were included. This dataset can be used to explore the efficacy of enteric methane mitigation strategies and their impact on beef cattle nutrition and production.

By compiling a database, which currently includes 285 DNA DSB repair experiments utilizing both photons and ions, we investigate the impact of distinct experimental parameters on the kinetics of DNA DSB repair. Methodological differences and inconsistencies in reporting make the comparison of data generated by different research groups challenging. Nevertheless, by implementing filtering criteria, we can compare repair kinetics obtained with normal and tumor cells derived from human or animal tissues, as well as cells exposed to photons or ions ranging from hydrogen to iron ions. In addition, several repair curves of repair deficient cell lines were included. The study aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive overview of experimental factors that may confound results and emphasize the importance of precise reporting of experimental parameters. Moreover, we identify gaps in the literature that require attention in future studies, aiming to address clinically relevant questions related to radiotherapy.

40131268.0,Genetic and Cheminformatic Characterization of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; Inhibitors Discovered in the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository.,"High-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules is a starting point for many drug development pipelines, including tuberculosis. These screens often result in multiple hits whose mechanisms of action remain unknown. From our initial HTS of the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR), we cherry-picked 935 compounds that inhibited the growth of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and set out to provide an early assessment of their antimycobacterial properties and mechanism of action. To characterize the MLSMR Mtb growth inhibitors, a combination of cheminformatics and targeted mutant screening against mutants in <i>katG</i>, <i>hadAB</i>, and a mixed pool of <i>mmpL3</i> mutants was used to characterize the hits. As a validation of this approach, we identified 101 isoniazid analogs that predictably lose all their antimycobacterial activities against the <i>katG</i> mutant. Interestingly, eight isoniazid analogs retain part of their activity against the mutant, suggesting an alternative KatG-independent mechanism. This approach also identified new compounds belonging to already known scaffolds that target HadAB or MmpL3. Additionally, we explored the nitro-containing compounds in our data set and discovered nitrofuranyl benzothiazoles that show enhanced activity against the <i>mmpL3</i> and <i>katG</i> mutants, a phenomenon known as collateral sensitivity. Overall, this study will serve as an important resource for further follow-up studies of antitubercular small molecules in the MLSMR library and provide a well-characterized training set for artificial intelligence-driven antimycobacterial drug discovery.",bio-resource,0.9512882,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40131268,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.4536675,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Diagnostic team was assembled to maintain quality of diagnostic and to collect phenotype information to database in Tokyo Medical Center (TMC). Over the past 10 years, 1538 pedigree [2788 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples] was collected from 38 ophthalmology departments and eye hospitals. Whole exome analysis has improved diagnostic rate from ~17% in 2011 to 53% in 2021, with 27% of known variants, 18% of novel variants in known gene, 8% of potential novel disease-causing genes, and 47% of pedigree with unknown cause. Approximately 70% of Japanese patients were affected by novel mutation or by unknown cause. In 2014, Asian Eye Genetics Consortium (AEGC) was established by researchers from Hong Kong, India, Japan, and the US, later renamed to Global Eye Genetics Consortium (GEGC) to expand the idea of collaborative research on rare genetic eye diseases in Asia, Middle East, Africa, and South America. GEGC phenotype-genotype database, GenEye, was constructed to collect and catalog genetic eye diseases at global scale. Over 200 members from 30 countries, GEGC now has 200 members from 30 continents, performing scientific programs, young investigator visiting program, and GEGC organized session at the meetings of the Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology (APAO), The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS), World Ophthalmology Congress (WOC), and International Society for Eye Research (ISER).",bio-resource,0.9801609,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35904986,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.45307282,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

We report a chromosomal-level haploid genome assembly of a muskox from Banks Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The assembly has a contig N50 of 44.7 Mbp, a scaffold N50 of 112.3 Mbp, a complete representation (100%) of the BUSCO v5.2.2 set of 9225 mammalian marker genes and is anchored to the 24 chromosomes of the muskox. Tabulation of heterozygous single nucleotide variants in our specimen revealed a very low level of genetic diversity, which is consistent with recent reports of the muskox having the lowest genome-wide heterozygosity among the ungulates. While muskox populations are currently showing no overt signs of inbreeding depression, environmental disruptions are expected to strain the genomic resilience of the species. One notable impact of rapid climate change in the Arctic is the spread of emerging infectious and parasitic diseases in the muskox, as exemplified by the range expansion of muskox lungworms, and the recent fatal outbreaks of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, a pathogen normally associated with domestic swine and poultry. As a genomics resource for conservation management of the muskox against existing and emerging disease modalities, we annotated the genes of the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 2 and performed an initial assessment of the genetic diversity of this complex. This resource is further supported by the annotation of the principal genes of the innate immunity system, genes that are rapidly evolving and under positive selection in the muskox, genes associated with environmental adaptations, and the genes associated with socioeconomic benefits for Arctic communities such as wool (qiviut) attributes. These annotations will benefit muskox management and conservation.",bio-resource,0.95972526,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39284808,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.45279294,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

40238114.0,"Transcriptome Meta-Analysis Uncovers Cell-Specific Regulatory Relationships in Embryonic, Juvenile, Adult, and Aged Mouse Lens Epithelium and Fibers.","<h4>Purpose</h4>The lens transcriptome has been examined using microarrays and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). These omics data are the basis of the bioinformatics web-resource iSyTE that has identified new genes involved in lens development and cataract. The lens predominantly contains epithelial and fiber cells, and yet, presently, iSyTE is based on whole lens data. To gain cell-specific regulatory insights, we meta-analyzed isolated epithelium and fiber transcriptomes from embryonic/postnatal, adult and aged lenses.<h4>Methods</h4>Mouse lens epithelium and fiber transcriptome public datasets at embryonic (E) and postnatal (P) stages E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, P0.5, P0, P5, P13, and age one month, three months, six months, and two years were analyzed. Microarray or RNA-seq data were analyzed by appropriate methods and compared to other resources (e.g., Cat-Map, CompBio).<h4>Results</h4>Across all RNA-seq datasets examined, 2466 genes are differentially expressed between epithelium and fibers, of which 106 are cataract-linked. Gene ontology enrichment validates epithelial and fiber expression, corroborating the meta-analysis. Whole embryonic-body-in silico subtraction and other analyses identify several new high-priority epithelial- and/or fiber-enriched genes (e.g., Casz1, Ell2). Furthermore, new insights into cell-specific regulatory processes at distinct stages are identified (e.g., ribonucleoprotein regulation in E12.5 epithelium). Finally, this data is made accessible at iSyTE (https://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iSyTE/).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This spatiotemporal transcriptome meta-analysis comprehensively informs on epithelium- and fiber-specific regulatory processes in developing, adult and aged lenses.

35889873.0,Chinese Food Image Database for Eating and Appetite Studies.,"Modern people live in an environment with ubiquitous food cues, including food advertisements, videos, and smells. Do these food cues change people's eating behavior? Since diet plays a crucial role in maintaining health, it has been researched for decades. As convenient alternatives for real food, food images are widely used in diet research. To date, researchers from Germany, Spain, and other countries have established food photo databases; however, these food pictures are not completely suitable for Chinese studies because of the ingredients and characteristics of Chinese food. The main goal of this research is to create a library of Chinese food images and to provide as complete a data reference as possible for future studies that use food images as experimental material. After standardized processing, we selected 508 common Chinese food pictures with high familiarity and recognizability and attached detailed classifications concerning taste, macronutrients, calories, and participants' emotional responses to the pictures. Additionally, with food pictures as material, we conducted research on how people make dietary decisions in order to identify the variables that may affect a person's food choices. The effects of individual perceived healthiness and palatability, gender, BMI, family income, and levels of emotional and restricted eating were examined using eating decisions based on healthiness and palatability as dependent variables. The results showed that people with low household incomes are more likely to be influenced by food taste in their dietary decision-making process, while individuals with high household incomes are more likely to consider the healthy aspects of food. Moreover, parental BMI affects what children consume, with children who have parents with higher BMIs being more prone to overlook the healthiness value of food.",bio-resource,0.533694,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35889873,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.4502706,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

However, as real-world negative reporting is missing, counterexamples that serve as contradictory evidence may exist. In this study, we have developed an anti-DDI resource, a set of drug combinations having negative reported interactions. This resource was created from a set of the top 200 most-used drugs, resulting in 14365 prospective negative reported DDI pairs. During analysis and filtering, 2110 DDIs (14.69%) were found in publicly free DDI resources, another 11130 (77.48%) were filtered by a rule-based inference engine incorporating ten mechanisms of interaction, and 208 were identified through commercial resources.

The Global Nurses Working Group (GNWG), an international group of nurses based out of the Global Consortium for Climate and Health Education (GCCHE) at Columbia University have developed two novel approaches to address these barriers and therefore increase the ability of the nursing workforce to ameliorate the negative health harms of climate change across practice settings.<h4>Discussion</h4>Nursing Climate Resources For Health Education, an evidence-based, peer-reviewed, repository of climate change and planetary health-related resources was created to address the gap in faculty knowledge of climate change and health. Developed by nursing faculty and students, resources include climate-specific learning objectives, case studies, and slide decks that can be integrated into existing courses. Population-focused categories were created to guide learning material development across the prelicensure, masters, and doctoral programs. Complementing the N-CRHE, Nursing on the Frontlines of the Climate Crisis: Education for Action, a virtual, free, 10-week course consisting of ten 60-minute presentations, was delivered by global climate change nurse experts. Each presentation focused on a climate-related health impact; participants were provided relevant materials and had the opportunity for engagement during the presentations. The program remains available for asynchronous viewing and continuing education credits are available. Certificates of participation were provided.

35174439.0,The network map of urotensin-II mediated signaling pathway in physiological and pathological conditions.,"Urotensin-II is a polypeptide ligand with neurohormone-like activity. It mediates downstream signaling pathways through G-protein-coupled receptor 14 (GPR14) also known as urotensin receptor (UTR). Urotensin-II is the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictor in mammals, promoting cardiovascular remodelling, cardiac fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. It is also involved in other physiological and pathological activities, including neurosecretory effects, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, kidney disease, and carcinogenic effects. Moreover, it is a notable player in the process of inflammatory injury, which leads to the development of inflammatory diseases. Urotensin-II/UTR expression stimulates the accumulation of monocytes and macrophages, which promote the adhesion molecules expression, chemokines activation and release of inflammatory cytokines at inflammatory injury sites. Therefore, urotensin-II turns out to be an important therapeutic target for the treatment options and management of associated diseases. The main downstream signaling pathways mediated through this urotensin-II /UTR system are RhoA/ROCK, MAPKs and PI3K/AKT. Due to the importance of urotensin-II systems in biomedicine, we consolidated a network map of urotensin-II /UTR signaling. The described signaling map comprises 33 activation/inhibition events, 31 catalysis events, 15 molecular associations, 40 gene regulation events, 60 types of protein expression, and 11 protein translocation events. The urotensin-II signaling pathway map is made freely accessible through the WikiPathways Database ( https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5158 ). The availability of comprehensive urotensin-II signaling in the public resource will help understand the regulation and function of this pathway in normal and pathological conditions.

37518472.0,An updated catalogue of the Collembola (Hexapoda) from Colombia and a perspective for unexplored richness.,"An updated catalog of Collembola nominal species recorded in Colombia is herein provided, including two new records for the country: Entomobrya linda Soto-Adames, 2002 and Folsomides centralis (Denis, 1931), both found in Reserva Natural Mesenia - Paramillo (Antioquia Department). The data were obtained from the original descriptions, as well as secondary records surveyed until December 2022. I considered localities whose studies contained identification at generic level, but disregarded those who only contained records at family level. For each species, its type locality and general distribution were provided, in addition to the site of record in Colombia, which were plotted on a map. I also present the cumulative number of nominal species recorded and described from Colombia from 1929 to 2022. Colombia has now 38 nominal species (20 endemic) in 21 genera (one endemic, plus 19 without nominal species) and 16 families of Collembola distributed in 22 sites of the 11 departments and five regions. Of this total of families, Bourletiellidae, Collophoridae, Hypogastruridae and Sminthuridae only has generic records, no nominal species. Based on these data, an estimate of the species richness was made suggesting that at the current rate of species records, to recognize 231 to 250 more species (6-7 species every 10 years), it will take about 300 years, and even so this time will not be sufficient to unveil the real fauna of Collembola of the country. For that reason, these results suggest that the Collembola fauna from Colombia is still underestimated in relation to other countries from South America.",bio-resource,0.95985264,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37518472,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.44873643,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37560038.0,"Competence-based catalog of learning objectives for the subject area of quality management in medical studies - position paper of the working group Quality Management in Education, Training and Continuing Education of the Society for Quality Management in Health Care (GQMG).","<h4>Background</h4>Traditionally, direct medical competences are taught in medical studies, whereas leadership and quality management competences are hardly taught, although graduates are already confronted with management tasks at the beginning of their clinical work. With the upcoming amendment of the Medical Licensing Regulations, this topic area will probably be addressed and must be adequately taught by the faculties. The learning objectives in the area of quality management listed in the current working version of the German National Catalogue of Learning Objectives in Medicine (NKLM) 2.0 have so far been formulated in rather general terms and need to be concretized.<h4>Aim</h4>To develop a competence-based learning objectives catalog for the topic area of quality management in medical studies as a structured framework recommendation for the design of faculty teaching-learning programs and as a suggestion for further development of the NKLM.<h4>Methods</h4>The competence-based learning objectives catalog was developed by an eight-member working group ""Quality Management in Education, Training and Continuing Education"" of the Gesellschaft für Qualitätsmanagement in der Gesundheitsversorgung e.V. (GQMG) within the framework of a critical synthesis of central publications. The members of the project group have many years of project experience in quality management in health care as well as in university didactics.<h4>Results</h4>Six basic competence goals as well as 10 specific competence goals could be formulated and consented upon. These are each flanked by a list of essential basic concepts and examples. These focus on quality improvements, including patient safety and treatment success against the background of a physician leadership role in an interprofessional context.<h4>Discussion</h4>A competency-based set of learning objectives has been compiled that encompasses the necessary concepts and basic knowledge of quality management required for those entering the profession to understand and actively participate in quality management after completing medical school. To the authors' knowledge, no comparable learning objectives catalog is currently available for medical studies, even internationally.",bio-resource,0.7784932,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37560038,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.44828367,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37127590.0,High-resolution structural variants catalogue in a large-scale whole genome sequenced bovine family cohort data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Structural variants (SVs) are chromosomal segments that differ between genomes, such as deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions and translocations. The genomics revolution enabled the discovery of sub-microscopic SVs via array and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, paving the way to unravel the functional impact of SVs. Recent human expression QTL mapping studies demonstrated that SVs play a disproportionally large role in altering gene expression, underlining the importance of including SVs in genetic analyses. Therefore, this study aimed to generate and explore a high-quality bovine SV catalogue exploiting a unique cattle family cohort data (total 266 samples, forming 127 trios).<h4>Results</h4>We curated 13,731 SVs segregating in the population, consisting of 12,201 deletions, 1,509 duplications, and 21 multi-allelic CNVs (> 50-bp). Of these, we validated a subset of copy number variants (CNVs) utilising a direct genotyping approach in an independent cohort, indicating that at least 62% of the CNVs are true variants, segregating in the population. Among gene-disrupting SVs, we prioritised two likely high impact duplications, encompassing ORM1 and POPDC3 genes, respectively. Liver expression QTL mapping results revealed that these duplications are likely causing altered gene expression, confirming the functional importance of SVs. Although most of the accurately genotyped CNVs are tagged by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ascertained in WGS data, most CNVs were not captured by individual SNPs obtained from a 50K genotyping array.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We generated a high-quality SV catalogue exploiting unique whole genome sequenced bovine family cohort data. Two high impact duplications upregulating the ORM1 and POPDC3 are putative candidates for postpartum feed intake and hoof health traits, thus warranting further investigation. Generally, CNVs were in low LD with SNPs on the 50K array. Hence, it remains crucial to incorporate CNVs via means other than tagging SNPs, such as investigation of tagging haplotypes, direct imputation of CNVs, or direct genotyping as done in the current study. The SV catalogue and the custom genotyping array generated in the current study will serve as valuable resources accelerating utilisation of full spectrum of genetic variants in bovine genomes.",bio-resource,0.9717862,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37127590,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.44731566,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37789969.0,Escitalopram Personalized Dosing: A Population Pharmacokinetics Repository Method.,"Escitalopram (SCIT) represents a first-line antidepressant and antianxiety medication. Pharmacokinetic studies of SCIT have demonstrated considerable interindividual variability, emphasizing the need for personalized dosing. Accordingly, we aimed to create a repository of parametric population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models of SCIT to facilitate model-informed precision dosing. In November 2022, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for published PPK models and identified eight models. All the structural models reported in the literature were either one- or two-compartment models. In order to investigate the variances in model performance, the parameters of all PPK models were derived from the literature published. A representative virtual population, characterized by an age of 30, a body weight of 70 kg, and a BMI of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, was generated for the purpose of replicating these models. To accomplish this, the rxode2 package in the R programming language was employed. Subsequently, we compared simulated concentration-time profiles and evaluated the impact of covariates on clearance. The most significant covariates were CYP2C19 phenotype, weight, and age, indicating that dosing regimens should be tailored accordingly. Additionally, among Chinese psychiatric patients, SCIT showed nearly double the exposure compared to other populations, specifically when considering the same CYP2C19 population restriction, which is a knowledge gap that needs further investigation. Furthermore, this repository of parametric PPK models for SCIT has a wide range of potential applications, like design miss or delay dose remedy strategies and external PPK model validation.",bio-resource,0.9872141,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37789969,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.44636485,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38968228.0,Identification of Southeast Asian Anopheles mosquito species using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.,"Malaria elimination in Southeast Asia remains a challenge, underscoring the importance of accurately identifying malaria mosquitoes to understand transmission dynamics and improve vector control. Traditional methods such as morphological identification require extensive training and cannot distinguish between sibling species, while molecular approaches are costly for extensive screening. Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has emerged as a rapid and cost-effective tool for Anopheles species identification, yet its current use is limited to few specialized laboratories. This study aimed to develop and validate an online reference database for MALDI-TOF MS identification of Southeast Asian Anopheles species. The database, constructed using the in-house data analysis pipeline MSI2 (Sorbonne University), comprised 2046 head mass spectra from 209 specimens collected at the Thailand-Myanmar border. Molecular identification via COI and ITS2 DNA barcodes enabled the identification of 20 sensu stricto species and 5 sibling species complexes. The high quality of the mass spectra was demonstrated by a MSI2 median score (min-max) of 61.62 (15.94-77.55) for correct answers, using the best result of four technical replicates of a test panel. Applying an identification threshold of 45, 93.9% (201/214) of the specimens were identified, with 98.5% (198/201) consistency with the molecular taxonomic assignment. In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS holds promise for malaria mosquito identification and can be scaled up for entomological surveillance in Southeast Asia. The free online sharing of our database on the MSI2 platform (https://msi.happy-dev.fr/) represents an important step towards the broader use of MALDI-TOF MS in malaria vector surveillance.",bio-resource,0.9821837,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38968228,1.5,has_url; impl_kw=1,False,False,True,1,0,0,0.4463195,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40518441.0,Glioportal: a comprehensive transcriptomic resource unveiling ligand-mediated mesenchymal transition in glioblastoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multi-omics profiling of glioblastoma (GBM) has unravelled two aspects fundamental to its aggressiveness and lethality that is molecular heterogeneity inherent to the tumour and cellular plasticity modulated by microenvironment. Yet, empirical validation to identify causal factors for these complex mechanisms is rather scarce. Here, we report our endeavour in establishing Glioportal, a GBM tumour biobank with derivative preclinical models and molecular information that we leverage for basic and translational research on precision therapies.<h4>Methods</h4>Bulk transcriptome and single-cell-based deconvolution analyses highlighted key features of distinct GBM subtypes and ligand-receptor pairs predicted to regulate malignant cell states plasticity. Synthetic genetic tracing tool and target genes/proteins expression analyses validated ligands-induced mesenchymal transition. This was further corroborated with phenotypic invasion/migration assays and cell-based assays using inhibitors, functional antibodies and gene silencing approaches. Proof-of-concept animal experiment was conducted using orthotopic xenograft carrying gene knockdown. Clinical relevance was assessed through immunohistochemical assay.<h4>Results</h4>Our transcriptomic analysis highlights the integral roles of STAT3 and NF-κB pathways in maintaining intrinsic mesenchymal identity and enabling myeloid-induced plasticity towards mesenchymal phenotype. One critical ligand, TNF, confers mesenchymal adaptation and cellular invasiveness that is mitigated by TNFRSF1A, but not TNFRSF1B, loss of function. TNFRSF1A silencing significantly improves survival in vivo.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Glioportal makes a valuable resource for identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities in molecularly stratified GBM. Here, we underscore GBM dependency on myeloid-derived ligands to acquire mesenchymal traits that has clinical implications in therapeutic response and recurrence. Such reliance warrants treatment strategies targeting ligand-receptor pairs to mitigate interactions with tumour ecosystem.",bio-resource,0.99711597,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40518441,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.4462302,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

38644527.0,"Unveiling unique alternative splicing responses to low temperature in Zoysia japonica through ZjRTD1.0, a high-quality reference transcript dataset.","Inadequate reference databases in RNA-seq analysis can hinder data utilization and interpretation. In this study, we have successfully constructed a high-quality reference transcript dataset, ZjRTD1.0, for Zoysia japonica, a widely-used turfgrass with exceptional tolerance to various abiotic stress, including low temperatures and salinity. This dataset comprises 113,089 transcripts from 57,143 genes. BUSCO analysis demonstrates exceptional completeness (92.4%) in ZjRTD1.0, with reduced proportions of fragmented (3.3%) and missing (4.3%) orthologs compared to prior datasets. ZjRTD1.0 enables more precise analyses, including transcript quantification and alternative splicing assessments using public datasets, which identified a substantial number of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) and differential alternative splicing (DAS) events, leading to several novel findings on Z. japonica's responses to abiotic stresses. First, spliceosome gene expression influenced alternative splicing significantly under abiotic stress, with a greater impact observed during low-temperature stress. Then, a significant positive correlation was found between the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoding protein kinases and the frequency of DAS events, suggesting the role of protein phosphorylation in regulating alternative splicing. Additionally, our results suggest possible involvement of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) in generating inclusion/exclusion isoforms under low-temperature stress. Furthermore, our investigation revealed a significantly enhanced overlap between DEGs and differentially alternatively spliced genes (DASGs) in response to low-temperature stress, suggesting a unique co-regulatory mechanism governing transcription and splicing in the context of low-temperature response. In conclusion, we have proven that ZjRTD1.0 will serve as a reliable and useful resource for future transcriptomic analyses in Z. japonica.",bio-resource,0.97067046,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38644527,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.44498017,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35346201.0,Development of the European Healthcare and Social Cost Database (EU HCSCD) for use in economic evaluation of healthcare programs.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Costs are one of the critical factors for the transferability of the results in health technology assessment and economic evaluation. The objective is to develop a cost database at the European level to facilitate cross-border cost comparisons in different settings and explains the factors that lead to differences in healthcare costs in different countries, taking into account the differences between health systems and other factors.<h4>Methodology</h4>The core of the database is compounded of three main categories (primary resources, composite goods and services, and complex processes and interventions) organized into 13 subcategories. A number of elements providing as detailed information of unit cost as possible were identified in order to mitigate the problem of comparability. Consortium partners validated both the database structure and selected costing items.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-seven costing items included in the EU HCSCD resulted in 1450 unit costs when taking into account all item subtypes and countries. Cross-country differences in costs are driven by the type of resources included in the costing items (e.g., overhead costs in case of complex processes and interventions) or by the variety of existing brands and/or models and the type of unit value in most of the primary resources.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The EU HCSCD is the only public unit healthcare and social cost database at European level that gather data on unit costs and explains differences in costs across countries. Its maintenance and regular data updating will enable establishing specific systems for generating and recording information that will meet many of its current limitations.",bio-resource,0.98001915,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35346201,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.44453466,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38003198.0,An Analysis of a Transposable Element Expression Atlas during 27 Developmental Stages in Porcine Skeletal Muscle: Unveiling Molecular Insights into Pork Production Traits.,"The development and growth of porcine skeletal muscle determine pork quality and yield. While genetic regulation of porcine skeletal muscle development has been extensively studied using various omics data, the role of transposable elements (TEs) in this context has been less explored. To bridge this gap, we constructed a comprehensive atlas of TE expression throughout the developmental stages of porcine skeletal muscle. This was achieved by integrating porcine TE genomic coordinates with whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq data from 27 developmental stages. We discovered that in pig skeletal muscle, active Tes are closely associated with active epigenomic marks, including low levels of DNA methylation, high levels of chromatin accessibility, and active histone modifications. Moreover, these TEs include 6074 self-expressed TEs that are significantly enriched in terms of muscle cell development and myofibril assembly. Using the TE expression data, we conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and identified a module that is significantly associated with muscle tissue development as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the signals of pig meat and carcass traits. Within this module, we constructed a TE-mediated gene regulatory network by adopting a unique multi-omics integration approach. This network highlighted several established candidate genes associated with muscle-relevant traits, including HES6, CHRNG, ACTC1, CHRND, MAMSTR, and PER2, as well as novel genes like ENSSSCG00000005518, ENSSSCG00000033601, and PIEZO2. These novel genes hold promise for regulating muscle-related traits in pigs. In summary, our research not only enhances the TE-centered dissection of the genetic basis underlying pork production traits, but also offers a general approach for constructing TE-mediated regulatory networks to study complex traits or diseases.",bio-resource,0.811683,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38003198,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.44417468,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

However, the functions of most lncRNAs remain to be elucidated. In order to study and screen novel lncRNAs with important functions in the carcinogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we constructed a lncRNA expression profile of 10 NPC tissues and 6 controls through a gene microarray. We identified 1,276 lncRNAs, of which most are unknown, with different expression levels in the healthy and NPC tissues. In order to shed light on the functions of these unknown lncRNAs, we first constructed a co-expression network of lncRNAs and mRNAs using bioinformatics and systematic biological approach. Moreover, mRNAs were clustered and enriched by their biological functions, and those lncRNAs have similar expression trends with mRNAs were defined as functional molecules with potential biological significance. The module may help identify key lncRNAs in the carcinogenesis of NPC and provide clues for in-depth study of their functions and associated signaling pathways. We suggest the newly identified lncRNAs may have clinic value as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for NPC diagnosis and treatment.",bio-resource,0.86009324,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35875165,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.4439325,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

To address this knowledge gap, we performed PDX1 ChIP-seq and single-cell RNA-seq using fetal human pancreata. We integrated our datasets with published datasets and revealed the dynamics of PDX1 binding and potential cell lineage-specific PDX1-bound genes in the pancreas from fetal to adult stages. We identified a core set of developmentally conserved PDX1-bound genes that reveal the broad multifaceted role of PDX1 in pancreas development. Despite the well-known dramatic changes in PDX1 function and expression, we found that PDX1-bound genes are largely conserved from embryonic to adult stages. This points towards a dual role of PDX1 in regulating the expression of its targets at different ages, dependent on other functionally congruent or directly interacting partners. We also showed that PDX1 binding is largely conserved in mouse pancreas. Together, our study reveals PDX1 targets in the developing pancreas in vivo and provides an essential resource for future studies on pancreas development.",bio-resource,0.97494036,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35708349,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.44378257,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

We then examined the diversity and compositional patterns of the gut virome in relation to common diseases by analyzing 6311 bulk metagenomes representing 28 disease or unhealthy states.<h4>Results</h4>The cnGVC contains 93,462 nonredundant viral genomes, with over 70% of these being novel viruses not included in existing gut viral databases. This resource enabled us to characterize the functional diversity and specificity of the gut virome. Using cnGVC, we profiled the gut virome in large-scale populations, assessed sex- and age-related variations, and identified 4238 universal viral signatures of diseases. A random forest classifier based on these signatures achieved high accuracy in distinguishing diseased individuals from controls (AUC = 0.698) and high-risk patients from controls (AUC = 0.761), and its predictive ability was also validated in external cohorts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our resources and findings significantly expand the current understanding of the human gut virome and provide a comprehensive view of the associations between gut viruses and common diseases.

36385508.0,Transcriptome annotation of 17 porcine tissues using nanopore sequencing technology.,"The annotation of animal genomes plays an important role in elucidating molecular mechanisms behind the genetic control of economically important traits. Here, we employed long-read sequencing technology, Oxford Nanopore Technology, to annotate the pig transcriptome across 17 tissues from two Yorkshire littermate pigs. More than 9.8 million reads were obtained from a single flow cell, and 69 781 unique transcripts at 50 108 loci were identified. Of these transcripts, 16 255 were found to be novel isoforms, and 22 344 were found at loci that were novel and unannotated in the Ensembl (release 102) and NCBI (release 106) annotations. Novel transcripts were mostly expressed in cerebellum, followed by lung, liver, spleen, and hypothalamus. By comparing the unannotated transcripts to existing databases, there were 21 285 (95.3%) transcripts matched to the NT database (v5) and 13 676 (61.2%) matched to the NR database (v5).

38816052.0,"Protocol for the Development and Analysis of the Oxford and Reading Cognitive Comorbidity, Frailty and Ageing Research Database-Electronic Patient Records (ORCHARD-EPR).","<h4>Background</h4>Hospital electronic patient records (EPRs) offer the opportunity to exploit large-scale routinely acquired data at relatively low cost and without selection. EPRs provide considerably richer data, and in real-time, than retrospective administrative data sets in which clinical complexity is often poorly captured. With population ageing, a wide range of hospital specialties now manage older people with multimorbidity, frailty and associated poor outcomes. We, therefore, set-up the Oxford and Reading Cognitive Comorbidity, Frailty and Ageing Research Database-Electronic Patient Records (ORCHARD-EPR) to facilitate clinically meaningful research in older hospital patients, including algorithm development, and to aid medical decision-making, implementation of guidelines, and inform policy.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>ORCHARD-EPR uses routinely acquired individual patient data on all patients aged ≥65 years with unplanned admission or Same Day Emergency Care unit attendance at four acute general hospitals serving a population of >800 000 (Oxfordshire, UK) with planned extension to the neighbouring Berkshire regional hospitals (>1 000 000). Data fields include diagnosis, comorbidities, nursing risk assessments, frailty, observations, illness acuity, laboratory tests and brain scan images. Importantly, ORCHARD-EPR contains the results from mandatory hospital-wide cognitive screening (≥70 years) comprising the 10-point Abbreviated-Mental-Test and dementia and delirium diagnosis (Confusion Assessment Method-CAM). Outcomes include length of stay, delayed transfers of care, discharge destination, readmissions and death. The rich multimodal data are further enhanced by linkage to secondary care electronic mental health records. Selection of appropriate subgroups or linkage to existing cohorts allows disease-specific studies. Over 200 000 patient episodes are included to date with data collection ongoing of which 129 248 are admissions with a length of stay ≥1 day in 64 641 unique patients.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>ORCHARD-EPR is approved by the South Central Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (ref: 23/SC/0258). Results will be widely disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences, and regional meetings to improve hospital data quality and clinical services.",bio-resource,0.92243165,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38816052,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.44255108,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

40654593.0,Towards collaborative data science in mental health research: The ECNP neuroimaging network accessible data repository.,"The current biologically uninformed psychiatric taxonomy complicates optimal diagnosis and treatment. Neuroimaging-based machine learning methods hold promise for tackling these issues, but large-scale, representative cohorts are required for building robust and generalizable models. The European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Neuroimaging Network Accessible Data Repository (ECNP-NNADR) addresses this need by collating multi-site, multi-modal, multi-diagnosis datasets that enable collaborative research. The newly established ECNP-NNADR includes 4829 participants across 21 cohorts and 11 distinct psychiatric diagnoses, available via the Virtual Pooling and Analysis of Research data (ViPAR) software. The repository includes demographic and clinical information, including diagnosis and questionnaires evaluating psychiatric symptomatology, as well as multi-atlas grey matter volume regions of interest (ROI). To illustrate the opportunities offered by the repository, two proof-of-concept analyses were performed: (1) multivariate classification of 498 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 498 matched healthy control (HC) individuals, and (2) normative age prediction using 1170 HC individuals with subsequent application of this model to study abnormal brain maturational processes in patients with SZ. In the SZ classification task, we observed varying balanced accuracies, reaching a maximum of 71.13% across sites and atlases. The normative-age model demonstrated a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.95 years [coefficient of determination (<i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> ) = 0.77, <i>P</i> < .001] across sites and atlases. The model demonstrated robust generalization on a separate HC left-out sample achieving a MAE of 7.16 years [<i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 0.74,<i>P</i> < .001]. When applied to the SZ group, the model exhibited a MAE of 7.79 years [<i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup>  = 0.79, <i>P</i> < .001], with patients displaying accelerated brain-aging with a brain age gap (BrainAGE) of 4.49 (8.90) years.

The Advanced BRain Imaging on ageing and Memory (ABRIM) project aims to add to these existing datasets by taking an adult lifespan approach to provide a cross-sectional, normative database with a particular focus on connectivity, myelinization and iron content of the brain in concurrence with cognitive functioning, mechanisms of reserve, and sleep-wake rhythms. ABRIM freely shares MRI and behavioural data from 295 participants between 18-80 years, stratified by age decade and sex (median age 52, IQR 36-66, 53.20% females). The ABRIM MRI collection consists of both the raw and pre-processed structural and functional MRI data to facilitate data usage among both expert and non-expert users. The ABRIM behavioural collection includes measures of cognitive functioning (i.e., global cognition, processing speed, executive functions, and memory), proxy measures of cognitive reserve (e.g., educational attainment, verbal intelligence, and occupational complexity), and various self-reported questionnaires (e.g., on depressive symptoms, pain, and the use of memory strategies in daily life and during a memory task). In a sub-sample (n = 120), we recorded sleep-wake rhythms using an actigraphy device (Actiwatch 2, Philips Respironics) for a period of 7 consecutive days. Here, we provide an in-depth description of our study protocol, pre-processing pipelines, and data availability. ABRIM provides a cross-sectional database on healthy participants throughout the adult lifespan, including numerous parameters relevant to improve our understanding of cognitive ageing. Therefore, ABRIM enables researchers to model the advanced imaging parameters and cognitive topologies as a function of age, identify the normal range of values of such parameters, and to further investigate the diverse mechanisms of reserve and resilience.",bio-resource,0.9766797,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38905233,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.4415873,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35906543.0,Genetic and genomic diversity in the sorghum gene bank collection of Uganda.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Plant Genetic Resources Centre at the Uganda National Gene Bank houses has over 3000 genetically diverse landraces and wild relatives of Sorghum bicolor accessions. This genetic diversity resource is untapped, under-utilized, and has not been systematically incorporated into sorghum breeding programs. In this study, we characterized the germplasm collection using whole-genome SNP markers (DArTseq). Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was implemented to study the racial ancestry of the accessions in comparison to a global sorghum diversity set and characterize the sub-groups present in the Ugandan (UG) germplasm.<h4>Results</h4>Population structure and phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of five subgroups among the Ugandan accessions. The samples from the highlands of the southwestern region were genetically distinct as compared to the rest of the population. This subset was predominated by the caudatum race and unique in comparison to the other sub-populations. In this study, we detected QTL for juvenile cold tolerance by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) resulting in the identification of 4 markers associated (-log10p > 3) to survival under cold stress under both field and climate chamber conditions, located on 3 chromosomes (02, 06, 09). To our best knowledge, the QTL on Sb09 with the strongest association was discovered for the first time.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study demonstrates how genebank genomics can potentially facilitate effective and efficient usage of valuable, untapped germplasm collections for agronomic trait evaluation and subsequent allele mining. In face of adverse climate change, identification of genomic regions potentially involved in the adaptation of Ugandan sorghum accessions to cooler climatic conditions would be of interest for the expansion of sorghum production into temperate latitudes.",bio-resource,0.8861268,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35906543,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.44129556,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Patients with CeD must avoid consuming these proteins. Regulators in Europe and the United States expect an evaluation of CeD risks from proteins in genetically modified (GM) crops or novel foods for wheat-related proteins. Our database includes evidence-based causative peptides and proteins and two amino acid sequence comparison tools for CeD risk assessment. Sequence entries are based on the review of published studies of specific gluten-reactive T cell activation or intestinal epithelial toxicity. The initial database in 2012 was updated in 2018 and 2022. The current database holds 1,041 causative peptides and 76 representative proteins. The FASTA sequence comparison of 76 representative CeD proteins provides an insurance for possible unreported epitopes. Validation was conducted using protein homologs from Pooideae and non-Pooideae monocots, dicots, and non-plant proteins. Criteria for minimum percent identity and maximum <i>E</i>-scores are guidelines. Exact matches to any of the 1,041 peptides suggest risks, while FASTA alignment to the 76 CeD proteins suggests possible risks.

Most context assessment frameworks and tools are evidence-informed; that is, based on literature and expert opinion/consensus. Quantitative evidence is lacking on which aspects of context most strongly predict implementation success. Implementers need this evidence to prioritize contextual factors for assessment and action.<h4>Methods</h4>The Atlas Initiative developed a prototype of surveys and data collection processes for populating the Atlas Context Data Repository, a large database that will enable statistical analyses of the relationship between context and implementation success. The prototype was piloted with eight US health care sites to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and utility for individual implementers and for use at scale. The researchers collected and analyzed quantitative data from the repository surveys, shared context assessment reports with sites, interviewed sites about their experiences, and held internal team debriefs.<h4>Results</h4>Sites found the Atlas prototype feasible and acceptable to implement and the context assessment reports useful for understanding their strengths and challenges. The Atlas Initiative successfully recruited repository participants and supported survey administration. The sample data, although too small to make predictive inferences, had reasonable distributions and low missingness.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The results indicate that the Atlas Context Data Repository can be feasibly implemented at scale with minor modifications to the prototype, that the repository database can support future statistical analyses when it has more data, and that participation in the repository is valuable and worthwhile for sites.",bio-resource,0.76785153,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35489802,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.4401267,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39698300.0,"Four distinct cytoplasmic structures generate and release specific vesicles, thus opening the way to intercellular communication.","In all cells, generation and release of specific vesicles are the initial steps of back-and-forth intercellular communication. These processes are critical in normal physiology and pathophysiology. Vesicles have particular functions appropriate to their targets. When stimulated, they are released into the extracellular space. Four cytoplasmic membrane-bound structures generate their particular vesicles. Among these structures, multivesicular bodies (MVBs) can accumulate many small vesicles in their lumen; release occurs upon MVB exocytosis. Ectosomes are larger vesicles characterized by their responses and are generated directly and released independently from specific microdomains pre-established in the thickness of the plasma membrane. Most lysosomes do not generate vesicles. However, unique components of a minor form, the endo-lysosome, constitute the third class of structures that release a few vesicles by exocytosis with molecules and structures inducing changes in the extracellular environment. The autophagosome, the fourth structure, releases several heterogeneous vesicles by exocytosis with malformed bio-molecules, assembled structures, and damaged organelles. Interestingly, the frequent interaction of autophagosomes with MVBs and their exosomes contributes to the regulation and intensity of their action. The specificity and function of released vesicles depend on their membranes' and luminal cargoes' composition and dynamics. An ongoing investigation of the various vesicles reveals new properties regarding their generation, release, and resulting extracellular processes. The growth of information about structures and their vesicles progressively extends the knowledge base regarding cell communication and contributes to their clinical applications.",bio-resource,0.570923,1,1,0.745,1,1,39698300,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.43934992,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

We regroup these regulatory elements in 16 components by nonnegative matrix factorization. Correlation between the genome-wide density of peaks and transcription start sites, correlation between peak accessibility and expression of neighboring genes, and enrichment in transcription factor binding motifs support their regulatory potential. Using a previously established catalog of 12,736,643 variants, we show that the proportion of single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is higher than expected and that this is owing to an approximately 1.3-fold higher mutation rate within peaks. Their site frequency spectrum indicates that variants in ATAC-seq peaks are subject to purifying selection. We generate eQTL data sets for liver and blood and show that variants that drive eQTL fall into liver- and blood-specific ATAC-seq peaks more often than expected by chance. We combine ATAC-seq and eQTL data to estimate that the proportion of regulatory variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks is approximately one in three and that the proportion of variants mapping to ATAC-seq peaks that are regulatory is approximately one in 25. We discuss the implication of these findings on the utility of ATAC-seq information to improve the accuracy of genomic selection.",bio-resource,0.9911192,1,0,0.5865,0,1,37751945,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.43876848,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The Single Case Archive (SCA) was constructed to facilitate access to the existing field of case study research for academic, clinical, and educational purposes. Cases were selected through systematic screening of relevant peer-reviewed journals in the field of psychotherapy research and rigorous snowball sampling. All cases meeting inclusion criteria were inventoried using the Inventory for Basic Information in Single Cases that maps study, patient, therapist, and therapy characteristics. About 3,471 cases from 175 peer-reviewed journals published between 1955 and 2019 were included in the SCA database. The SCA comprises cases from different theoretical backgrounds, discussing patients from different age categories, with different presenting problems going through a diversity of psychotherapeutic treatments that are studied using a range of methods. Cases differ strongly with respect to the amount of information that is present in the case study, and the field should pay more attention to ethical considerations like informed consent and providing relevant basic descriptive information. An online platform makes the SCA database searchable by researchers, clinicians, and students. In conclusion, the SCA is a unique resource that makes case studies more easily accessible, facilitates meta-studies and reviews of case studies, and stimulates methodological developments in the field of case study research.

37608227.0,A Functional Atlas of the Cerebellum Based on NeuroSynth Task Coordinates.,"Although the human cerebellum has a surface that is about 80% of that of the cerebral cortex and has about four times as many neurons, its functional organization is still very much uncharted. Despite recent attempts to provide resting-state and task-based parcellations of the cerebellum, these two approaches lead to large discrepancies. This article describes a comprehensive task-based functional parcellation of the human cerebellum based on a large-scale functional database, NeuroSynth, involving an unprecedented diversity of tasks, which were reliably associated with ontological key terms referring to psychological functions. Involving over 44,500 participants from this database, we present a parcellation that exhibits replicability with earlier resting-state parcellations across cerebellar and neocortical structures. The functional parcellation of the cerebellum confirms the major networks revealed in prior work, including sensorimotor, directed (dorsal) attention, divided (ventral) attention, executive control, mentalizing (default mode) networks, tiny patches of a limbic network, and also a unilateral language network (but not the visual network), and the association of these networks with underlying ontological key terms confirms their major functionality. The networks are revealed at locations that are roughly similar to prior resting-state cerebellar parcellations, although they are less symmetric and more fragmented across the two hemispheres. This functional parcellation of the human cerebellum and associated key terms can provide a useful guide in designing studies to test specific functional hypotheses and provide a reference for interpreting the results.",bio-resource,0.82408506,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37608227,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.43801117,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

These descriptors (McGowan's characteristic volume, excess molar refraction, dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen-bond acidity and basicity, and the gas-liquid partition constant on n-hexadecane at 298.15 K) are curated in two publicly accessible databases for hundreds (WSU compound descriptor database) or thousands (Abraham compound descriptor database). These databases were developed independently using different approaches resulting in descriptor values that vary for many compounds. Previously, it was shown that the two descriptor databases are not interchangeable, and the WSU descriptor database consistently demonstrated improved model performance for chromatographic systems where the uncertainty in the dependent variable was minimized by suitable quality control and calibration procedures. In this report we wish to evaluate whether the same conclusions are true for models with a dependent variable containing significant measurement uncertainty. To evaluate this hypothesis, we assembled databases for water-air, octanol-air, and octanol-water partition constants reported by multiple laboratories using various measurement methods. It was found that database selection has little effect on model quality or model predictive capability but significantly affects the assignment of the contribution of individual intermolecular interactions to the dependent variable.

The Entomological Reference Collection (CER) originated naturally from the research of Paulo César Antunes and John Lane and is a national and international heritage covering primary and secondary types of insect species that are of interest to public health. Over the years, it has been consolidated with the efforts of Augusto Ayroza Galvão, Renato Corrêa, José Coutinho, Nelson Cerqueira, Ernesto Rabello, Oswaldo Forattini and others. In its over eighty years of activities, CER has enabled the training of several scientists able to act in programs of surveillance and control of endemic diseases associated with insect vectors throughout Latin America, in addition to training taxonomists focused on insects of interest in Public Health. Researchers from other Brazilian institutes and abroad joined the entomology laboratory because of its importance and the research developed in it.

36225664.0,Don't Let Perfect Be the Enemy of Good: A Proof of Concept for a Custom National Data Repository of Quality Measures for Free and Charitable Clinics.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Free and charitable clinics (FCCs), nonprofits that utilize volunteer licensed health care professionals to provide health services at no cost or a small fee to low-income uninsured patients who are disproportionately from underrepresented communities, have been part of the safety net for over a century. Approximately 1400 known FCCs serve two million patients annually. Despite their longevity and sizable number, evidence regarding the quality of care in FCCs is lacking. We report new evidence generated by a national initiative, the Roadmap to Health Equity. Established in 2017, this consortium is co-led by two national organizations serving FCCs and an academic institution. It has involved more than 150 FCC stakeholders with the shared goal of improving the quality of care and reducing inequities. The centerpiece is a custom national data repository of 15 validated clinical quality measures and patient-level characteristics.<h4>Methods</h4>Fifty FCCs pilot tested the data repository. Clinics submitted patient-level data on two blood pressure (BP) measures and at least one additional measure. Descriptive statistics were stratified by sex, race, ethnicity, and language.<h4>Results</h4>In 2021, 33 pilot FCCs from 21 states reported data across 13 of the 15 clinical measures, representing 34,359 unique patients. For example, on average, 60% of patients had controlled BP, but Black patients had lower rates of BP control than Hispanic and White patients (55.9% vs. 62.1% and 63.0%, respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings demonstrate a proof of concept. By standardizing quality measures alongside patient characteristics, clinics can become aware of racial/ethnic inequalities in health outcomes. This information can motivate clinics to investigate the causes and implement solutions. In an environment where outcome data from FCCs are scarce, the new national data repository lays the foundation for routine stratified reporting of a range of quality outcomes for an important safety net for the uninsured.",bio-resource,0.92615163,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36225664,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.437582,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

35684258.0,Virus and Virus-like Pathogens in the Grapevine Virus Collection of Croatian Autochthonous Grapevine Cultivars.,"Grapevine collections play an important role, especially in the study of viruses and virus-like pathogens. In 2009, after an initial ELISA screening for eight viruses (arabis mosaic virus, grapevine fanleaf virus, grapevine fleck virus, grapevine leafroll-associated viruses 1, 2, and 3, and grapevine viruses A and B), a collection of 368 grapevine accessions representing 14 different Croatian autochthonous cultivars and containing single or mixed infection of viruses was established to further characterize the viral pathogens. Subsequently, Western blot, RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing revealed that grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus was frequently found in accessions of the collection, with isolates showing substantial genetic diversity in the helicase and coat protein regions. High-throughput sequencing of 22 grapevine accessions provides additional insight into the viruses and viroids present in the collection and confirms the fact that Croatian autochthonous grapevine cultivars have high infection rates and high virome diversity. The recent spread of ""flavescence dorée"" phytoplasma in Europe has not spared the collection. After the first symptoms observed in 2020 and 2021, the presence of phytoplasma was confirmed by LAMP in six grapevine accessions and some of them were lost. Single or multiple viruses and viroids, as well as own rooted grapevines in the collection, make the plants susceptible to various abiotic factors, which, together with the recent occurrence of ""flavescence dorée"", makes the maintenance of the collection a challenge.

40384750.0,Implementation and impact of a diversity supplement repository.,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) diversity supplements represent an opportunity to enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce. Despite their potential impact, practical barriers prevent effective use of these resources. The Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (ACTRI) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) developed and implemented of an institutional repository and support system to improve diversity supplement applications. The centralized repository and support system incorporated three strategies: (1) a secure web-based repository housing successful examples of supplements, (2) match making for diversity supplements and mentors, and (3) web-based resources for potential applicants. The repository was implemented in June 2021 and includes 51 supplement samples across 14 divisions of NIH as of November 2024. The repository has been accessed by 51 potential applicants since implementation in 2021. Few investigators have requested match making. Early indicators show a doubling in diversity supplement applications compared to pre-implementation period at UCSD. We outlined our approach to addressing some of the barriers in diversity supplement applications, which could provide a model for other institutions. Pending solutions to some of the lessons learned, coordinated efforts aimed at diversity supplements could be a practical approach toward a more diverse biomedical research workforce.",bio-resource,0.72496766,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40384750,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.43447584,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Both tissues have been used interchangeably clinically even though their detailed composition, heterogeneity, and mechanisms of action have neither been rigorously inventoried nor compared. This lack of information has prevented investigations into ideal dosages and has facilitated anecdata and misinformation. Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes, proteomes, and flow cytometry profiles from paired clinical-grade BMAC and ADSVF. This comparative transcriptional atlas challenges the prevalent notion that there is one therapeutic cell type present in both tissues. We also provide data of surface markers that may enable isolation and investigation of cell (sub)populations.

An understanding of the molecular basis of their biology would contribute to better management and sustainable production. Thus, we conducted transcriptome sequencing of 100 to 105 tissues from two females of each of seven species of herbivore (cattle, sheep, goats, sika deer, horses, donkeys, and rabbits) including two breeds of sheep. The quality of raw and trimmed reads was assessed in terms of base quality, GC content, duplication sequence rate, overrepresented k-mers, and quality score distribution with FastQC. The high-quality filtered RNA-seq raw reads were deposited in a public database which provides approximately 54 billion high-quality paired-end sequencing reads in total, with an average mapping rate of ~93.92%.

36317479.0,Chicken chromatin accessibility atlas accelerates epigenetic annotation of birds and gene fine-mapping associated with growth traits.,"The development of epigenetic maps, such as the ENCODE project in humans, provides resources for gene regulation studies and a reference for research of disease-related regulatory elements. However, epigenetic information, such as a bird-specific chromatin accessibility atlas, is currently lacking for the thousands of bird species currently described. The major genomic difference between birds and mammals is their shorter introns and intergenic distances, which seriously hinders the use of humans and mice as a reference for studying the function of important regulatory regions in birds. In this study, using chicken as a model bird species, we systematically compiled a chicken chromatin accessibility atlas using 53 Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) samples across 11 tissues. An average of 50 796 open chromatin regions were identified per sample, cumulatively accounting for 20.36% of the chicken genome. Tissue specificity was largely reflected by differences in intergenic and intronic peaks, with specific functional regulation achieved by two mechanisms: recruitment of several sequence-specific transcription factors and direct regulation of adjacent functional genes. By integrating data from genome-wide association studies, our results suggest that chicken body weight is driven by different regulatory variants active in growth-relevant tissues. We propose <i>CAB39L</i> (active in the duodenum), <i>RCBTB1</i> (muscle and liver), and novel long non-coding RNA <i>ENSGALG00000053256</i> (bone) as candidate genes regulating chicken body weight. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of epigenetic data in fine-mapping functional variants and provides a compendium of resources for further research on the epigenetics and evolution of birds and mammals.",bio-resource,0.94564223,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36317479,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.4337243,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

However, our understanding of lymphoma NHCs has been hampered by unexplained NHC heterogeneity, even in normal human lymph nodes (LNs). Here we constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas of more than 100,000 NHCs collected from 27 human samples, including LNs and various nodal lymphomas, and it revealed 30 distinct subclusters, including some that were previously unrecognized. Notably, this atlas was useful for comparative analyses with lymphoma NHCs, which revealed an unanticipated landscape of subcluster-specific changes in gene expression and interaction with malignant cells in follicular lymphoma NHCs. This facilitates our understanding of stromal remodelling in lymphoma and highlights potential clinical biomarkers. Our study largely updates NHC taxonomy in human LNs and analysis of disease status, and provides a rich resource and deeper insights into LN and lymphoma biology to advance lymphoma management and therapy.",bio-resource,0.9407066,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35332263,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.43367472,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Analyses of genotype-expression associations show pronounced enrichment of associations with genes of drug response. The associations are primarily consistent across the two RNA-Seq datasets, with some modest variation, indicating the importance of obtaining multiple datasets to produce a robust resource. We further used an empirical Bayesian model to compare eQTL patterns in liver and an additional 20 GTEx tissues, finding that MHC genes, and especially class II genes, are enriched for liver-specific eQTL patterns. To illustrate the utility of the resource to augment GWAS analysis with small sample sizes, we developed a novel meta-analysis technique to combine several liver eQTL data sources. We also illustrate its application using a transcriptome-enhanced re-analysis of a study of neutropenia in pancreatic cancer patients.

However, due to the lack of reference genome and transcriptome, it is limited to the further molecular mechanism research and gene function mining. To develop a full-length reference transcriptome, tissues from five different parts of <i>P. orientalis</i> and four cone developmental stages were sequenced and analyzed by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing through the PacBio platform in this study.

40505091.0,Systematic Evidence Map for the Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Universe.,"<h4>Background</h4>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a research priority for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Because PFAS include thousands of structurally diverse chemicals, there is a pressing need for identifying what data are available to assess the human health hazard of these compounds.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used systematic evidence map (SEM) methods to summarize the available epidemiological and mammalian bioassay evidence for ∿14,735 chemicals identified as PFAS by EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE). This work is a continuation of our previous 2022 and 2024 SEMs that inventoried evidence on a separate set of ∿500 PFAS. The Comprehensive PFAS Dashboard includes evidence identified from our past SEMs and completed EPA assessments.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted literature searches from peer-reviewed and gray literature sources to identify, screen, and inventory mammalian bioassay and epidemiological literature. A combination of manual review and machine learning software were utilized. A diverse array of potentially relevant supplemental content was also tracked, including mechanistic data, exposure-only studies, and studies informing chemical toxicokinetics and clearance. For each study meeting predefined population, exposure, comparator, and outcome (PECO) criteria, experimental design details and health endpoints evaluated were summarized in interactive web-based literature inventory visuals. Epidemiology studies and animal bioassay studies with ≥21-day exposure duration or reproductive/developmental study design proceeded to undergo a study evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity, as well as detailed extraction of health endpoint data. Underlying data are publicly available and can be downloaded.<h4>Results</h4>Scientific database searches retrieved 152,205 references. After full-text screening, there were 347 mammalian bioassay and 44 epidemiological studies that met PECO criteria. The mammalian bioassay and epidemiological evidence assessed 99 and 30 individual PFAS, respectively (n = 18 PFAS with both). The epidemiological evidence assessed 15 health systems and the mammalian bioassay evidence assessed 16 health systems.<h4>Discussion</h4>Results from our 2022 and 2024 SEMs and completed EPA assessments are compiled into Comprehensive PFAS Dashboard. This dashboard is a resource for better understanding the currently available PFAS human health hazard data. It can be used as a tool for researchers and regulators interested in PFAS data gaps and research needs. Across all the data sources compiled into the Comprehensive PFAS Dashboard, only 1.4% (214/14,735) of PFAS had any mammalian bioassay or epidemiological data available.

Here, we update the atlas of totally 77 mAbs against emerging sub-variants including BQ.1.1 and XBB and find that BA.4/5, BQ.1.1, and XBB display further evasion. Besides, investigation into the correlation of binding and neutralization of mAbs reveals the important role of antigenic conformation in mAb functioning. Moreover, the complex structures of BA.2 RBD/BD-604/S304 and BA.4/5 RBD/BD-604/S304/S309 further elucidate the molecular mechanism of antibody evasion by these sub-variants.

The case study performed for validation purposes demonstrates that a JHAKG can operate as a knowledge base that answers queries regarding hazards, external factors, level of risks, and appropriate control measures to mitigate risks. As the JHAKG is a database of knowledge representing a large number of actual JHA cases previously developed and also implicit knowledge that has not been formalized in any explicit forms yet, the quality of JHA documents produced from queries to the database is expectedly higher than the ones produced by an individual safety manager in terms of completeness and comprehensiveness.",bio-resource,0.83166903,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37112233,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.42968908,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39411274.0,Benefits and Drawbacks of International Medical Elective Databases in Abroad Elective Research: A Narrative Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>International medical electives (IMEs) are considered high-impact practice in global health education. Nevertheless, international medical elective (IME) research remains scarce, with only a few new publications appearing each year. The discrepancy between the many unanswered questions regarding IMEs and the lack of opportunities to perform research in this field has been further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Elective databases cataloguing structured IME reports/testimonies could offer a viable solution here. This narrative review provides a balanced and objective evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of elective databases, summarizing their potential usefulness in IME research.<h4>Methods</h4>The methodology employed was a multidisciplinary narrative review of the published and grey literature on databases cataloguing IME testimonies.<h4>Results</h4>Elective databases offer numerous benefits to the IME researcher. Their size allows for large analyses, built on hundreds of equally structured elective testimonies. Pre-defined outcomes, such as the elective destination, elective discipline or duration, are queried in a standardized way, allowing for a broad set of research questions. Elective databases are usually open-access, not confined to a single university, and free to use. Most databases also offer user-friendly filter functions, permitting targeted analyses centered around a particular outcome. A major drawback is that reports are rarely verified. Subject to several forms of bias (eg, recall and reporting bias), elective databases may not be suitable for all types of research questions, and the report quality is often inhomogeneous. Above all, they rarely allow for an informational depth that may result from qualitative face-to-face interviews.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Elective databases could be a valuable supplement to interview-based elective research, potentially allowing for larger and broader analyses not confined to single institutions.",bio-resource,0.8535264,1,0,0.5576,0,1,39411274,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.42926812,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

38170404.0,Distribution and conservation of simple sequence repeats in plant pathogenic species of Zymoseptoria and development of genomic resources for its orphaned species.,"To better understand the structure and evolution of the genomes of four plant pathogenic species of Zymoseptoria, we analyzed the occurrence, relative abundance (RA), and density (RD) of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in their whole genome and transcriptome sequences. In this study, SSRs are defined as repeats of more than 12 bases in length. The genome and transcriptome sequences of Zymoseptoria ardabiliae show the highest RA (201.1 and 129.9) and RD (3229.4 and 1928.2) of SSRs, while those of Zymoseptoria pseudotritici show the lowest RA (167.2 and 118.5) and RD (2482.2 and 1687.0). The majority of SSRs in the genomic and transcriptome sequences of species were trinucleotide SSRs, while dinucleotide SSRs were the least common. The most common trinucleotide motifs in the transcriptomic sequences across all species were those that encoded the amino acid arginine. As per our motif conservation study, Zymoseptoria tritici (12.4%) possessed the most unique motifs, while Z. pseudotritici (3.9%) had the fewest. Overall, only 38.1% of the motifs were found to be conserved among the species. Gene enrichment studies reveal that three of the species, Z. ardabiliae, Zymoseptoria brevis, and Z. pseudotritici, have SSRs in their genes related to cellular metabolism, while the remaining Z. tritici harbors SSRs in genes related to DNA synthesis and gene expression. In an effort to improve the genetic resources for the orphan species of pathogenic Zymoseptoria, a total of 73,134 primers were created.

39760635.0,[The decline of analog radiological collection].,"Throughout the 20th century, radiographs and fluoroscopies became essential elements to complete clinical evaluation. Images of the most relevant cases, together with their clinical records, were stored in the radiological collections of the hospitals. Over time, the need for physical space due to the emergence of new equipment, together with the digitization of radiographs and their digital storage, put an end to the collections, many of which were lost in a corner of modern X-ray services. That could have been the history of the analog radiological collection of the Hospital Manuel Arriarán, very prolific while its main supporters, Dr. Julio Hasbún Salamé and his successor Dr. Manuel Mena Castro, were active, but then it was forgotten. However, after a great fire occurred in the Hospital Clínico San Borja-Arriarán (HCSBA) in 2021, among the water and debris of the Radiology Department, the boxes containing the Pediatric Radiological Collection were found.

Our purpose is to review the existing image repositories fulfilling the criteria for imaging biobanks.<h4>Methods</h4>Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for articles published in English from January 2010 to July 2021 using a combination of the terms: ""imaging"" AND ""biobanks"" and ""imaging"" AND ""repository"". Moreover, the Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS) database ( https://cordis.europa.eu/projects ) was searched using the terms: ""imaging"" AND ""biobanks"", also including collections, projects, project deliverables, project publications and programmes.<h4>Results</h4>Of 9272 articles retrieved, only 54 related to biobanks containing imaging data were finally selected, of which 33 were disease-oriented (61.1%) and 21 population-based (38.9%). Most imaging biobanks were European (26/54, 48.1%), followed by American biobanks (20/54, 37.0%). Among disease-oriented biobanks, the majority were focused on neurodegenerative (9/33, 27.3%) and oncological diseases (9/33, 27.3%). The number of patients enrolled ranged from 240 to 3,370,929, and the imaging modality most frequently involved was MRI (40/54, 74.1%), followed by CT (20/54, 37.0%), PET (13/54, 24.1%), and ultrasound (12/54, 22.2%).

A relatively small proportion of current biobanks also contain images and can thus be classified as imaging biobanks.<h4>Key points</h4>• Imaging biobanks are a powerful tool for large-scale collection and processing of medical images integrated with imaging biomarkers and patient non-imaging data. • Most imaging biobanks retrieved were European, disease-oriented and accessible under user request. • While many biobanks have been developed so far, only a relatively small proportion of them are imaging biobanks.",bio-resource,0.9478735,1,1,0.6152,1,1,35001159,1.0,has_url,False,False,True,0,0,0,0.42771992,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35946434.0,Transcriptional targets of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia protein TDP-43 - meta-analysis and interactive graphical database.,"TDP-43 proteinopathy is the major pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mounting evidence implicates loss of normal TDP-43 RNA-processing function as a key pathomechanism. However, the RNA targets of TDP-43 differ by report, and have never been formally collated or compared between models and disease, hampering understanding of TDP-43 function. Here, we conducted re-analysis and meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets from six TDP-43-knockdown models, and TDP-43-immunonegative neuronal nuclei from ALS/FTD brain, to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential exon usage (DEU) events. There was little overlap in DEGs between knockdown models, but PFKP, STMN2, CFP, KIAA1324 and TRHDE were common targets and were also differentially expressed in TDP-43-immunonegative neurons. DEG enrichment analysis revealed diverse biological pathways including immune and synaptic functions. Common DEU events in human datasets included well-known targets POLDIP3 and STMN2, and novel targets EXD3, MMAB, DLG5 and GOSR2. Our interactive database (https://www.scotterlab.auckland.ac.nz/research-themes/tdp43-lof-db/) allows further exploration of TDP-43 DEG and DEU targets. Together, these data identify TDP-43 targets that can be exploited therapeutically or used to validate loss-of-function processes.

37436896.0,A comprehensive atlas of perineuronal net distribution and colocalization with parvalbumin in the adult mouse brain.,"Perineuronal nets (PNNs) surround specific neurons in the brain and are involved in various forms of plasticity and clinical conditions. However, our understanding of the PNN role in these phenomena is limited by the lack of highly quantitative maps of PNN distribution and association with specific cell types. Here, we present a comprehensive atlas of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-positive PNNs and colocalization with parvalbumin (PV) cells for over 600 regions of the adult mouse brain. Data analysis shows that PV expression is a good predictor of PNN aggregation. In the cortex, PNNs are dramatically enriched in layer 4 of all primary sensory areas in correlation with thalamocortical input density, and their distribution mirrors intracortical connectivity patterns. Gene expression analysis identifies many PNN-correlated genes. Strikingly, PNN-anticorrelated transcripts are enriched in synaptic plasticity genes, generalizing PNNs' role as circuit stability factors.",bio-resource,0.5122596,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37436896,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.42758754,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38270275.0,Down Syndrome Biobank Consortium: A perspective.,"Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have a partial or complete trisomy of chromosome 21, resulting in an increased risk for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia by early midlife. Despite ongoing clinical trials to treat late-onset AD, individuals with DS are often excluded. Furthermore, timely diagnosis or management is often not available. Of the genetic causes of AD, people with DS represent the largest cohort. Currently, there is a knowledge gap regarding the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of DS-related AD (DS-AD), partly due to limited access to well-characterized brain tissue and biomaterials for research. To address this challenge, we created an international consortium of brain banks focused on collecting and disseminating brain tissue from persons with DS throughout their lifespan, named the Down Syndrome Biobank Consortium (DSBC) consisting of 11 biobanking sites located in Europe, India, and the USA. This perspective describes the DSBC harmonized protocols and tissue dissemination goals.",bio-resource,0.9790173,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38270275,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.42757457,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37499616.0,A catalog of microbial genes and metagenome-assembled genomes from the quail gut microbiome.,"The gut microbiome plays an important role in quail feed efficiency, immunity, production, and even behavior. Gut microbial gene catalogs and reference genomes are important for understanding the quail gut microbiome. However, quail gut microbes are lacked sequenced genomes and functional information to date. In this study, we report the first catalog of the microbial genes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) in fecal and cecum luminal content samples from 3 quail breeds using deep metagenomic sequencing. We identified a total of 2,419,425 nonredundant genes in the quail genome catalog, and a total of 473 MAGs were reconstructed through binning analysis. At 95% average nucleotide identity, the 473 MAGs were clustered into 283 species-level genome bins (SGBs), of which 225 SGBs belonged to species without any available genomes in the current database. Based on the quail gene catalog and MAGs, we identified 142 discriminative bacterial species and 244 discriminative MAGs between Chinese yellow quails and Japanese quails. The discriminative MAGs suggested a strain-level difference in the gut microbial composition. Additionally, a total of 25 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional terms and 88 carbohydrate-active enzymes were distinctly enriched between Chinese yellow quails and Japanese quails. Most of the different species and MAGs were significantly interrelated with the shifts in the functional capacities of the quail gut microbiome. Taken together, we constructed a quail gut microbial gene catalog and enlarged the reference of quail gut microbial genomes. The results of this study provide a powerful and invaluable resource for quail gut microbiome-related research.",bio-resource,0.997359,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37499616,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.4275022,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39754094.0,What makes an epidemic a disaster: the future of epidemics within the EM-DAT International Disaster Database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Reporting on and monitoring epidemics is a public health priority. Several initiatives and platforms provide epidemiological data, such as the EM-DAT International Disaster Database, which has 1525 epidemics and their impact reported since 1900, including 892 epidemics between 2000 and 2023. However, EM-DAT has inconsistent coverage and deficiencies regarding the systematic monitoring of epidemics data due to the lack of a standardized methodology to define what will be included under an epidemic disaster.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a sequential study that included an online survey of experts in infectious diseases, public health emergencies, and related data, followed by committee discussions with disaster experts. This approach aimed to identify appropriate definitions and entry criteria for archiving disease outbreak events.<h4>Results</h4>The survey had 21 respondents from universities and international organizations, with experts primarily specialized in infectious disease surveillance. Experts agreed that epidemics should be considered as disasters. Experts cited challenges in defining epidemic thresholds. However, they proposed pathogen-based criteria and agreed that disruption to society, especially to the healthcare system, serves as a determinant of epidemic disasters. The experts favored deaths and confirmed cases as key indicators, alongside suggestions on refining EM-DAT's entry criteria and improving epidemic impact assessment.<h4>Discussion</h4>This article offers valuable insights into epidemic disasters, a topic previously underdefined in the literature, thereby enhancing understanding for policymakers and public health professionals.",bio-resource,0.935247,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39754094,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.4261037,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35752163.0,A database of pediatric drug effects to evaluate ontogenic mechanisms from child growth and development.,"<h4>Background</h4>Adverse drug effects (ADEs) in children are common and may result in disability and death, necessitating post-marketing monitoring of their use. Evaluating drug safety is especially challenging in children due to the processes of growth and maturation, which can alter how children respond to treatment. Current drug safety-signal-detection methods do not account for these dynamics.<h4>Methods</h4>We recently developed a method called disproportionality generalized additive models (dGAMs) to better identify safety signals for drugs across child-development stages.<h4>Findings</h4>We used dGAMs on a database of 264,453 pediatric adverse-event reports and found 19,438 ADEs signals associated with development and validated these signals against a small reference set of pediatric ADEs. Using our approach, we can hypothesize on the ontogenic dynamics of ADE signals, such as that montelukast-induced psychiatric disorders appear most significant in the second year of life. Additionally, we integrated pediatric enzyme expression data and found that pharmacogenes with dynamic childhood expression, such as CYP2C18 and CYP27B1, are associated with pediatric ADEs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We curated KidSIDES, a database of pediatric drug safety signals, for the research community and developed the Pediatric Drug Safety portal (PDSportal) to facilitate evaluation of drug safety signals across childhood growth and development.<h4>Funding</h4>This study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",bio-resource,0.9931612,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35752163,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.42594466,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36557593.0,Red Sea Atlas of Coral-Associated Bacteria Highlights Common Microbiome Members and Their Distribution across Environmental Gradients-A Systematic Review.,"The Red Sea is a suitable model for studying coral reefs under climate change due to its strong environmental gradient that provides a window into future global warming scenarios. For instance, corals in the southern Red Sea thrive at temperatures predicted to occur at the end of the century in other biogeographic regions. Corals in the Red Sea thrive under contrasting thermal and environmental regimes along their latitudinal gradient. Because microbial communities associated with corals contribute to host physiology, we conducted a systematic review of the known diversity of Red Sea coral-associated bacteria, considering geographic location and host species. Our assessment comprises 54 studies of 67 coral host species employing cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent techniques. Most studies have been conducted in the central and northern Red Sea, while the southern and western regions remain largely unexplored. Our data also show that, despite the high diversity of corals in the Red Sea, the most studied corals were <i>Pocillopora verrucosa</i>, <i>Dipsastraea</i> spp., <i>Pleuractis granulosa</i>, and <i>Stylophora pistillata</i>. Microbial diversity was dominated by bacteria from the class Gammaproteobacteria, while the most frequently occurring bacterial families included <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i> and <i>Vibrionaceae</i>. We also identified bacterial families exclusively associated with each of the studied coral orders: Scleractinia (<i>n</i> = 125), Alcyonacea (<i>n</i> = 7), and Capitata (<i>n</i> = 2).

However, they do not mimic the disease as it occurs in humans, and their use has failed to identify novel therapies effective for many highly prevalent non-communicable diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, the clinical failure rate in drug development remains very high, with an overall likelihood of approval from Phase I of about 9.6%. On the other hand, human-based models, advanced imaging techniques and human epidemiological studies may increase our understanding of disease aetiology and pathogenesis and enable the advance of safe and effective therapies. Particularly when human tissues are used, they may produce faster, cheaper results, more predictive for humans, whilst yielding greater comprehensions of human biochemical processes.

Current drug metabolism research is based on liver tissue predominantly obtained from people of European origin, with limited access to tissue from people of African origin. Given the interindividual and interpopulation genomic variability in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, efficacy and safety of some drugs are poorly predicted for African populations. To address this gap, we have established the first comprehensive liver tissue biorepository inclusive of people of African origin. The African Liver Tissue Biorepository Consortium currently includes three institutions in South Africa and one in Zimbabwe, with plans to expand to other African countries. The program has collected 67 liver samples as of July 2023. DNA from the donors was genotyped for 120 variants in 46 pharmacogenes and revealed variants that are uniquely found in African populations, including the low-activity, African-specific CYP2C9*5 and *8 variants relevant to the metabolism of diclofenac. Larger liver tissue samples were used to isolate primary human hepatocytes. Viability of the hepatocytes and microsomal fractions was demonstrated by the activity of selected cytochrome P450s. This resource will be used to ensure the safety and efficacy of existing and new drugs in African populations. This will be done by characterizing compounds for properties such as drug clearance, metabolite and enzyme identification, and drug-drug and drug-gene interactions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Standard optimization of the drug metabolism of new molecular entities in the pharmaceutical industry uses subcellular fractions such as microsomes and isolated primary hepatocytes, being done mainly with tissue from donors of European origin.

Mucosal subepithelial PDGFRα+ cells (MuPαC) are important regulators in various intestinal diseases including fibrosis and inflammation. However, the transcriptome of MuPαC has not yet been elucidated. Using Pdgfra-eGFP mice and flow cytometry, we isolated colonic MuPαC and obtained their transcriptome data. In analyzing the transcriptome, we identified three novel, and selectively expressed, markers (Adamdec1, Fin1, and Col6a4) found in MuPαC. In addition, we identified a unique set of MuPαC-enriched genetic signatures including groups of growth factors, transcription factors, gap junction proteins, extracellular proteins, receptors, cytokines, protein kinases, phosphatases, and peptidases. These selective groups of genetic signatures are linked to the unique cellular identity and function of MuPαC. Furthermore, we have added this MuPαC transcriptome data to our Smooth Muscle Genome Browser that contains the transcriptome data of jejunal and colonic smooth muscle cells (SMC), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), and smooth muscle resident PDGFRα+ cells: (https://med.unr.edu/physio/transcriptome).

An incomplete reference genome and limited availability of full-length cDNAs have hindered the identification of alternatively spliced transcripts, which slowed down related basic studies on bats' echolocation and evolution. In this study, we analyzed five organs from <i>H. armiger</i> for the first time using PacBio single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT).

In 2012, the United States Pharmacopeial Convention created a database of food ingredient fraud. The objective of this research was to report on updates made to the database structure and to provide an updated analysis of food fraud records. The restructured database was relational and included four tables: ingredients, adulterants, adulteration records, and references. Four adulteration record types were created to capture the variety of information that can be found in public food fraud reports. Information was searched and extracted from the peer-reviewed scientific literature, media publications, regulatory reports, judicial records, trade association reports, and other public sources covering 1980-present. Over an almost seven-year data entry period, a total of 15,575 records were entered, sourced primarily from the peer-reviewed literature and media reports. The percentage of records that included at least one potentially hazardous adulterant ranged from 34% to 60%, depending on the record type. The ingredients with the highest number of incident and inference records included fluid cow's milk, extra virgin olive oil, honey, beef, and chili powder. The ingredient groups with the highest number of incident and inference records included Dairy Ingredients, Seafood Products, Meat and Poultry Products, Herbs, Spices, and Seasonings, Milk and Cream, and Alcoholic Beverages. This database was created to serve as a standardized source of information about publicly documented occurrences of food fraud and other information relevant to fraud risk to support food fraud vulnerability assessments, mitigation plans, and food safety plans.

More than three decades ago, its members established a continental registry. Today, more than 700,000 patients have been registered, and information has been gathered on more than 800,000 transplants. This huge amount of information has allowed conducting multiple retrospective studies, evaluating changes in practices over time and for different categories of diseases, benchmarking outcome across EBMT affiliated centers, and increasingly serves to build synthetic comparators to evaluate the introduction of therapeutic innovations in the field of hematology. CAR-T cells therapies draw on human and technical resources that are also used to deliver HCT; they elicit side effects that require the implementation of risk mitigation plans; they are living drugs that persist in the body of the recipient and thus deserve prolonged follow-up; the introduction of CAR-T cells in the pharmacopeia is likely to significantly impact on the practice of BMT; for all these reasons and even before the first approvals of CAR-T Cells in Europe, EBMT engaged in a project aiming at complementing the EBMT Registry with a Cellular Therapy Form, with the objective to register CAR-T cells treated patients and collect information on their short-, middle- and long-term outcome. The goal is to provide EBMT investigators with a tool for primary analyses of the collected information and to support secondary use of data transferred at the individual level to Marketing Authorization Holders and other interested parties, to fulfill their obligations to health authorities and further evaluate the actual medical values of CAR-T Cells in different contexts and indications.

39569397.0,PAHFKB: A knowledge base to support personalized exercise prescription recommendations in prevention and intervention of heart failure.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>Guidelines for exercise recommendations are typically designed for the population as a whole and do not account for individual differences, making it challenging to provide personalized exercise training for individuals with complex conditions. To address this issue, this study aimed to develop PAHFKB (Physical Activity-Heart Failure Knowledge Base), a knowledge-based system for personalized exercise prescription (EP) for heart failure (HF), by mining, analyzing, and organizing existing literature and data on the relationship between physical activity (PA) and HF.<h4>Methods</h4>Firstly, 3186 citations on PAHF were gathered from PubMed. Then, the data standards for personalized PAHF were defined with the entity-relationship model. Following data collection in accordance with these standards, PAHFKB was developed using MySQL and ASP.NET, integrating elaborate and diverse PAHF evidence, knowledge-based EP and visualization tools.<h4>Results</h4>PAHFKB (pahfkb.sysbio.org.cn) incorporated 357 studies published between 1989 and 2021, involving over 900,000 subjects from 43 countries. And 1010 PAHF items were extracted, encompassing 357 exercise training protocols, 333 outcomes, and 42 risk factors for HF prevention and intervention. Among all protocols, the most frequently employed regimen consisted of three 60-minute sessions of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training on a weekly basis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PAHFKB is an online system designed to support personalized EP in HF management. It incorporates diverse tools and visualization and will promote personalized decision support, establish data standards, and advance interpretable artificial intelligence in digital health.

36213257.0,The global landscape of approved antibody therapies.,"Antibody therapies have become an important class of therapeutics in recent years as they have exhibited outstanding efficacy and safety in the treatment of several major diseases including cancers, immune-related diseases, infectious disease and hematological disease. There has been significant progress in the global research and development landscape of antibody therapies in the past decade. In this review, we have collected available data from the Umabs Antibody Therapies Database (Umabs-DB, https://umabs.com) as of 30 June 2022. The Umabs-DB shows that 162 antibody therapies have been approved by at least one regulatory agency in the world, including 122 approvals in the US, followed by 114 in Europe, 82 in Japan and 73 in China, whereas biosimilar, diagnostic and veterinary antibodies are not included in our statistics. Although the US and Europe have been at the leading position for decades, rapid advancement has been witnessed in Japan and China in the past decade. The approved antibody therapies include 115 canonical antibodies, 14 antibody-drug conjugates, 7 bispecific antibodies, 8 antibody fragments, 3 radiolabeled antibodies, 1 antibody-conjugate immunotoxin, 2 immunoconjugates and 12 Fc-Fusion proteins. They have been developed against 91 drug targets, of which PD-1 is the most popular, with 14 approved antibody-based blockades for cancer treatment in the world. This review outlined the global landscape of the approved antibody therapies with respect to the regulation agencies, therapeutic targets and indications, aiming to provide an insight into the trends of the global development of antibody therapies.",bio-resource,0.9964869,1,1,0.612,1,1,36213257,1.5,has_url; impl_kw=1,False,False,True,1,0,0,0.41641587,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38853370.0,A comprehensive Thai pharmacogenomics database (TPGxD-1): Phenotype prediction and variants identification in 942 whole-genome sequencing data.,"Computational methods analyze genomic data to identify genetic variants linked to drug responses, thereby guiding personalized medicine. This study analyzed 942 whole-genome sequences from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) cohort to establish a population-specific pharmacogenomic database (TPGxD-1) in the Thai population. Sentieon (version 201808.08) implemented the GATK best workflow practice for variant calling. We then annotated variant call format (VCF) files using Golden Helix VarSeq 2.5.0 and employed Stargazer v2.0.2 for star allele analysis. The analysis of 63 very important pharmacogenes (VIPGx) reveals 85,566 variants, including 13,532 novel discoveries. Notably, we identified 464 known PGx variants and 275 clinically relevant novel variants. The phenotypic prediction of 15 VIPGx demonstrated a varied metabolic profile for the Thai population. Genes like CYP2C9 (9%), CYP3A5 (45.2%), CYP2B6 (9.4%), NUDT15 (15%), CYP2D6 (47%) and CYP2C19 (43%) showed a high number of intermediate metabolizers; CYP3A5 (41%), and CYP2C19 (9.9%) showed more poor metabolizers. CYP1A2 (52.7%) and CYP2B6 (7.6%) were found to have a higher number of ultra-metabolizers. The functional prediction of the remaining 10 VIPGx genes reveals a high frequency of decreased functional alleles in SULT1A1 (12%), NAT2 (84%), and G6PD (12%). SLCO1B1 reports 20% poor functional alleles, while PTGIS (42%), SLCO1B1 (4%), and TPMT (5.96%) showed increased functional alleles. This study discovered new variants and alleles in the 63 VIPGx genes among the Thai population, offering insights into advancing clinical pharmacogenomics (PGx). However, further validation is needed using other computational and genotyping methods.",bio-resource,0.9942363,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38853370,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.41589487,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37955086.0,Postmortem Brain Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: The South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Repository.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neuroimaging bears the promise of providing new biomarkers that could refine the diagnosis of dementia. Still, obtaining the pathology data required to validate the relationship between neuroimaging markers and neurological changes is challenging. Existing data repositories are focused on a single pathology, are too small, or do not precisely match neuroimaging and pathology findings.<h4>Objective</h4>The new data repository introduced in this work, the South Texas Alzheimer's Disease research center repository, was designed to address these limitations. Our repository covers a broad diversity of dementias, spans a wide age range, and was specifically designed to draw exact correspondences between neuroimaging and pathology data.<h4>Methods</h4>Using four different MRI sequences, we are reaching a sample size that allows for validating multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers and studying comorbid conditions. Our imaging protocol was designed to capture markers of cerebrovascular disease and related lesions. Quantification of these lesions is currently underway with MRI-guided histopathological examination.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 139 postmortem brains (70 females) with mean age of 77.9 years were collected, with 71 brains fully analyzed. Of these, only 3% showed evidence of AD-only pathology and 76% had high prevalence of multiple pathologies contributing to clinical diagnosis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This repository has a significant (and increasing) sample size consisting of a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders and employs advanced imaging protocols and MRI-guided histopathological analysis to help disentangle the effects of comorbid disorders to refine diagnosis, prognosis and better understand neurodegenerative disorders.",bio-resource,0.98615986,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37955086,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.41553867,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40404628.0,Insights from the Biorepository and Integrative Genomics pediatric resource.,"The Biorepository and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Initiative in Tennessee has developed a pioneering resource to address gaps in genomic research by linking genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data from a diverse Mid-South population, including underrepresented groups. We analyzed 13,152 exomes from BIG and found significant genetic diversity, with 50% of participants inferred to have non-European or several types of admixed ancestry. Ancestry within the BIG cohort is stratified, with distinct geographic and demographic patterns, as African ancestry is more common in urban areas, while European ancestry is more common in suburban regions. We observe ancestry-specific rates of novel genetic variants, which are enriched for functional or clinical relevance. Disease prevalence analysis linked ancestry and environmental factors, showing higher odds ratios for asthma and obesity in minority groups, particularly in the urban area. Finally, we observe discrepancies between self-reported race and genetic ancestry, with related individuals self-identifying in differing racial categories. These findings underscore the limitations of race as a biomedical variable. BIG has proven to be an effective model for community-centered precision medicine. We integrated genomics education, and fostered great trust among the contributing communities. Future goals include cohort expansion, and enhanced genomic analysis, to ensure equitable healthcare outcomes.",bio-resource,0.8525262,1,0,0.5742,0,1,40404628,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.41522223,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Its genome was sequenced and assembled into chromosomes. However, the genome annotation of C. seticuspe still needs to be improved to elucidate the complex regulatory networks in this species.<h4>Results</h4>In addition to the 74,259 mRNAs annotated in the C. seticuspe genome, we identified 18,265 novel mRNAs, 51,425 novel lncRNAs, 501 novel miRNAs and 22,065 novel siRNAs. Two C-class genes and YABBY family genes were highly expressed in disc florets, while B-class genes were highly expressed in ray florets. A WGCNA was performed to identify the hub lncRNAs and mRNAs in ray floret- and disc floret-specific modules, and CDM19, BBX22, HTH, HSP70 and several lncRNAs were identified. ceRNA and lncNAT networks related to flower development were also constructed, and we found a latent functional lncNAT-mRNA combination, LXLOC_026470 and MIF2.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The annotations of mRNAs, lncRNAs and small RNAs in the C. seticuspe genome have been improved. The expression profiles of flower development-related genes, ceRNA networks and lncNAT networks were identified, laying a foundation for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying disc floret and ray floret formation.",bio-resource,0.7895925,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36333790,-1.0,usage_kw=2,False,False,False,0,2,0,0.4149335,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40281125.0,An atlas of ferroptosis-induced secretomes.,"Cells undergoing regulated necrosis systemically communicate with the immune system via the release of protein and non-protein secretomes. Ferroptosis is a recently described iron-dependent type of regulated necrosis driven by massive lipid peroxidation. While membrane rupture occurs during ferroptosis, a comprehensive appraisal of ferroptotic secretomes and their potential biological activity has been lacking. Here, we apply a multi-omics approach to provide an atlas of ferroptosis-induced secretomes and reveal a novel function in macrophage priming. Proteins with assigned DAMP and innate immune system function, such as MIF, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and chaperones, were released from ferroptotic cells. Non-protein secretomes with assigned inflammatory function contained oxylipins as well as TCA- and methionine-cycle metabolites. Interestingly, incubation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with ferroptotic supernatants induced transcriptional reprogramming consistent with priming. Indeed, exposure to ferroptotic supernatants enhanced LPS-induced cytokine production. These results define a catalog of ferroptosis-induced secretomes and identify a biological activity in macrophage priming with important implications for the fine-tuning of inflammatory processes.",bio-resource,0.8190696,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40281125,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.41393745,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

39096105.0,Histology Atlas of the Developing Mouse Respiratory System From Prenatal Day 9.0 Through Postnatal Day 30.,"Respiratory diseases are one of the leading causes of death and disability around the world. Mice are commonly used as models of human respiratory disease. Phenotypic analysis of mice with spontaneous, congenital, inherited, or treatment-related respiratory tract abnormalities requires investigators to discriminate normal anatomic features of the respiratory system from those that have been altered by disease. Many publications describe individual aspects of normal respiratory tract development, primarily focusing on morphogenesis of the trachea and lung. However, a single reference providing detailed low- and high-magnification, high-resolution images of routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections depicting all major structures of the entire developing murine respiratory system does not exist. The purpose of this atlas is to correct this deficiency by establishing one concise reference of high-resolution color photomicrographs from whole-slide scans of H&E-stained tissue sections. The atlas has detailed descriptions and well-annotated images of the developing mouse upper and lower respiratory tracts emphasizing embryonic days (E) 9.0 to 18.5 and major early postnatal events. The selected images illustrate the main structures and events at key developmental stages and thus should help investigators both confirm the chronological age of mouse embryos and distinguish normal morphology as well as structural (cellular and organ) abnormalities.",bio-resource,0.58303255,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39096105,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.41230622,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36163311.0,A single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human ciliary body.,"The ciliary body critically contributes to the ocular physiology with multiple responsibilities in the production of aqueous humor, vision accommodation and intraocular immunity. Comparatively little work, however, has revealed the single-cell molecular taxonomy of the human ciliary body required for studying these functionalities. In this study, we report a comprehensive atlas of the cellular and molecular components of human ciliary body as well as their interactions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Cluster analysis of the transcriptome of 14,563 individual ciliary cells from the eyes of 3 human donors identified 14 distinct cell types, including the ciliary epithelium, smooth muscle, vascular endothelial cell, immune cell and other stromal cell populations. Cell-type discriminative gene markers were also revealed. Unique gene expression patterns essential for ciliary epithelium-mediated aqueous humor inflow and ciliary smooth muscle contractility were identified. Importantly, we discovered the transitional states that probably contribute to the transition of ciliary macrophage into retina microglia and verified no lymphatics in the ciliary body. Moreover, the utilization of CellPhoneDB allowed us to systemically infer cell-cell interactions among diverse ciliary cells including those that potentially participate in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and uveitis. Altogether, these new findings provide insights into the regulation of intraocular pressure, accommodation reflex and immune homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions.",bio-resource,0.59919757,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36163311,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.41169694,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

A database with information on 143 FB types (51 single-layered, 15 double-layered, 66 garnished, 11 fried) was established. Flours were from soft wheat (67.4%), durum wheat (13.7%), corn (8.6%), rye, sorghum, chickpea, and chestnut (together 5.2%). The raising agents were compressed yeast (55.8%), sourdough (16.7%), baking powder (9.0%), but 18.6% of FBs were unleavened. Sixteen old-style baking systems were recorded, classified into baking plates and vertical ovens (<i>tannur</i> and <i>tabun</i>). Artisanal FBs accounted for 82%, while the industrial ones for 7%. Quality schemes (national, European or global) applied to 91 FBs. Fifteen FBs were rare, prepared only for family consumption: changes in lifestyle and increasing urbanization may cause their disappearance. Actions are needed to prevent the reduction of biodiversity related to FBs.

37808537.0,"A dataset of criteria on the use of thermal insulation solutions in building facades located in Norway, Portugal and Italy.","The building sector is responsible for a significant percentage of the energy consumption in Europe. The level of thermal insulation of the building envelope leads to decrease energy consumption, thus contributing towards a sustainable and efficient built environment. As a result, the choice of the most suitable thermal insulation solution to be applied both in new construction and in retrofitting of building facades is fundamental for a satisfactory thermal performance of the building. Nevertheless, the thermal insulation solution should not be chosen considering only the thermal performance, but rather based on a set of performance parameters (i.e., water resistance, fire performance, impact on the environment and human health, among others) and climate-related requirements. This data article includes a dataset on criteria adopted in three European countries (namely Norway, Portugal, and Italy) considering a PESTE analysis (i.e., criteria related to Political, Economic, Social, Technological, and Environmental questions). The main objective was to evaluate the knowledge and perception of people living and/or working in these countries about the use and the performance of thermal insulation solutions in building facades. To this aim a questionnaire was developed within the scope of the EEA Granted EFFICACY research project (November 2022 - February 2023), whose overall objective is to create a database that serves as a reference for the choice of thermal insulation solutions to be applied in building facades for thermal and energy performances optimization.

Digital healthcare ecosystems emerge to target increasing healthcare costs and invest in standard Application Programming Interfaces (API), such as HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) for trusted data flows.<h4>Objectives</h4>This scoping review assessed the role and impact of HL7 FHIR and associated Implementation Guides (IGs) in digital healthcare ecosystems focusing on chronic disease management.<h4>Methods</h4>To study trends and developments relevant to HL7 FHIR, a scoping review of the scientific and gray English literature from 2017 to 2023 was used.<h4>Results</h4>The selection of 93 of 524 scientific papers reviewed in English indicates that the popularity of HL7 FHIR as a robust technical interface standard for the health sector has been steadily rising since its inception in 2010, reaching a peak in 2021. Digital Health applications use HL7 FHIR in cancer (45 %), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (more than 15 %), and diabetes (almost 15 %). The scoping review revealed that references to HL7 FHIR IGs are limited to ∼ 20 % of articles reviewed. HL7 FHIR R4 was most frequently referenced when the HL7 FHIR version was mentioned. In HL7 FHIR IGs registries and the internet, we found 35 HL7 FHIR IGs addressing chronic disease management, i.e., cancer (40 %), chronic disease management (25 %), and diabetes (20 %). HL7 FHIR IGs frequently complement the information in the article.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HL7 FHIR matures with each revision of the standard as HL7 FHIR IGs are developed with validated data sets, common shared HL7 FHIR resources, and supporting tools.

By tailoring treatment to the local context, it improves patient outcomes and reduces costs, with the potential to serve as a global model for culturally adapted healthcare solutions.<h4>Background</h4>Fracture liaison services (FLS) are specialized programs that aim to identify, treat, and manage patients who have experienced fragility fractures, with the overarching goal of preventing future fractures. Recognizing the need for a culturally appropriate and coordinated approach, the Turkish Osteoporosis Society has developed FracTurk, a national digitized FLS database tailored to the unique cultural, socioeconomic, and healthcare landscape of Türkiye. This paper provides an overview of the FracTurk system, detailing its development, potential benefits, and significance while also offering insights into future considerations for this initiative. By prioritizing digitalization and standardization within the FLS system, we aimed to pave a smooth patient pathway, ensuring a seamless journey through post-fracture care.<h4>Material and methods</h4>The FracTurk database was developed through a systematic process that involved the standardization and digitalization of patient follow-up forms and clinical practices across various institutions in Türkiye with international guidelines under the supervision of mentors certified by the International Osteoporosis Foundation, Capture the Fracture Initiative, which has been active for over 10 years in many countries. Additionally, the system incorporates clinical decision support tools and is customized to align with the Turkish cultural and healthcare landscape.<h4>Results</h4>Since its launch, the FracTurk database has been actively utilized by 25 users across 23 centers, with over 731 registered patients. The system continues to expand, demonstrating high levels of adoption and growth, indicating its increasing relevance and impact within the Turkish healthcare system. During the launch, the major difficulties and limitations encountered by the centers were discussed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>FracTurk constitutes a noteworthy step forward in digitizing and adapting FLS to the Turkish context.

37131406.0,Landscape and significance of human super enhancer-driven core transcription regulatory circuitry.,"A core transcription regulatory circuitry (CRC) is an interconnected self-regulatory circuitry that is formed by a group of core transcription factors (TFs). These core TFs collectively regulate gene expression by binding not only to their own super enhancers (SEs) but also to the SEs of one another. For most human tissue/cell types, a global view of CRCs and core TFs has not been generated. Here, we identified numerous CRCs using two identification methods and detailed the landscape of the CRCs driven by SEs in large cell/tissue samples. The comprehensive biological analyses, including sequence conservation, CRC activity and genome binding affinity were conducted for common TFs, moderate TFs, and specific TFs, which exhibit different biological features. The local module located from the common CRC network highlighted the essential functions and prognostic performance. The tissue-specific CRC network was highly related to cell identity. Core TFs in tissue-specific CRC networks exhibited disease markers, and had regulatory potential for cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, a user-friendly resource named CRCdb (http://www.licpathway.net/crcdb/index.html) was developed, which contained the detailed information of CRCs and core TFs used in this study, as well as other interesting results, such as the most representative CRC, frequency of TFs, and indegree/outdegree of TFs.",bio-resource,0.99733436,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37131406,1.0,has_url,False,False,True,0,0,0,0.40771246,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Aberrant activation via mutations that change amino acids in proteins of the pathway can result in diseases. While disease-centric databases like COSMIC catalog mutations in cancer, their prevalence in healthy populations remains underexplored. We systematically studied such mutations in the JAK-STAT genes by comparing COSMIC and the population-focused All of Us database. Our analysis revealed frequent mutations in all JAK and STAT domains, particularly among white females. We further identified three categories: Mutations uniquely found in All of Us that were associated with cancer in the literature but could not be found in COSMIC, underscoring COSMIC's limitations. Mutations unique to COSMIC underline their potential as drivers of cancer due to their absence in the general population. Mutations present in both databases, e.g., JAK2<sup>Val617Phe/V617F</sup> - widely recognized as a cancer driver in hematopoietic cells, but without disease associations in All of Us, raising the possibility that combinatorial SNPs might be responsible for disease development.

The efforts to conserve FAnGR are minimal in Bhutan. In the pursuit of increasing livestock productivity, farmers are rearing livestock that narrows the range of genetic diversity. This review attempts to summarize the status of FAnGR and the efforts to conserve them. Some unique livestock breeds in Bhutan are Nublang (cattle breed), Yak, Saphak (pig breed), Yuta (horse breed), Merak-Saktenpa (horse breed), and Belochem (chicken breed). There was a drop in the yak, buffalo, equine, pig, sheep, and goat populations.

40661123.0,﻿Hidden treasures of herbaria - even small collections contain a wealth of diversity: the powdery mildews of the North Carolina State Larry F. Grand Mycological Herbarium.,"The occurrence of cryptic species is well documented in fungi but the extent of their diversity is not fully understood. This study assessed the fungal diversity within a part of the Larry F. Grand Mycological Herbarium (NCSLG), a small, well-maintained collection at North Carolina State University, with a focus on the powdery mildew fungi (<i>Erysiphaceae</i>). <i>Erysiphaceae</i> were selected due to their economic impact as plant pathogens and availability of extensive DNA sequence data for multiple barcode loci. Our research objectives included determining the number of phylogenetic species compared with those identified morphologically, and to identify undescribed species. We generated sequence data for 220 of the 299 powdery mildew specimens (73% success rate) in the herbarium, which represented 60 species in 10 genera, collected from 134 host plant species. Our analyses revealed that ~83% (183/220) of the sequenced specimens had identifications that were incorrect and/or outdated based on current genus/species concepts. Additionally, four new species are described: <i>Erysipheamphicarpaeicola</i>, <i>E.ulmi-alatae</i>, <i>E.quercus-virginianae</i>, and <i>Takamatsuellagrandii</i>. A specimen deposited at NCSLG is designated as an epitype for <i>Phyllactinialiriodendri</i>, and a species of <i>Phyllactinia</i> identified on <i>Carpinuscaroliniana</i>, as well as multiple species infecting <i>Quercus</i> spp., likely represent additional undescribed species that require more data. This research highlights the critical role of herbarium collections in uncovering fungal biodiversity, and underscores the importance of preserving these valuable resources, particularly with the growing trend to discard herbaria due to financial and space constraints.",bio-resource,0.8349815,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40661123,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.40637308,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35627288.0,Genomic Survey and Resources for the Boring Giant Clam <i>Tridacna crocea</i>.,"The boring giant clam <i>Tridacna crocea</i> is an evolutionary, ecologically, economically, and culturally important reef-dwelling bivalve targeted by a profitable ornamental fishery in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. In this study, we developed genomic resources for <i>T. crocea</i>. Using low-pass (=low-coverage, ~6×) short read sequencing, this study, for the first time, estimated the genome size, unique genome content, and nuclear repetitive elements, including the 45S rRNA DNA operon, in <i>T. crocea</i>. Furthermore, we tested if the mitochondrial genome can be assembled from RNA sequencing data. The haploid genome size estimated using a k-mer strategy was 1.31-1.39 Gbp, which is well within the range reported before for other members of the family Cardiidae. Unique genome content estimates using different k-mers indicated that nearly a third and probably at least 50% of the genome of <i>T. crocea</i> was composed of repetitive elements. A large portion of repetitive sequences could not be assigned to known repeat element families. Taking into consideration only annotated repetitive elements, the most common were classified as Satellite DNA which were more common than Class I-LINE and Class I-LTR Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon elements. The nuclear ribosomal operon in <i>T. crocea</i> was partially assembled into two contigs, one encoding the complete ssrDNA and 5.8S rDNA unit and a second comprising a partial lsrDNA. A nearly complete mitochondrial genome (92%) was assembled from RNA-seq.

Limited SSR markers in blackhead seabream have been reported. The availability of the blackhead seabream genome assembly provided the opportunity to carry out genome-wide identification for all microsatellite markers, and bioinformatic analyses open the way for developing a microsatellite genome-wide database in blackhead seabream. In this study, a total of 412,381 SSRs were identified in the 688.08 Mb genome by Krait software. Whole-genome sequences (10×) of 42 samples were aligned against the reference genome and genotyped using the HipSTR tools by comparing and counting repeat number variation across the SSR loci. A total of 156,086 SSRs with a 2-4 bp repeat were genotyped by HipSTR tools, which accounted for 55.78% of the 2-4 bp SSRs in the reference genome. High accuracy of genotyping was observed by comparing HipSTR tools and PCR amplification. A set of 109,131 loci with a number of alleles ≥ 3 and with a number of genotyped individuals ≥ 6 were reserved to constitute the polymorphic SSR database. Fifty-one polymorphic SSR loci were identified through PCR amplification. This strategy to develop polymorphic SSR markers not only obtained a large set of polymorphic SSRs but also eliminated the need for laborious experimental screening. SSR markers developed in this study may facilitate blackhead seabream research, which lays a certain foundation for further gene tagging and genetic linkage analysis, such as marker-assisted selection, genetic mapping, as well as comparative genomic analysis.",bio-resource,0.9947674,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36980892,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.4053172,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

These include wound-healing activity, anti-inflammatory effects, antitumor activity, and other therapeutic benefits. Despite its extensive traditional use, a comprehensive review of the scientific studies conducted over the past two decades is lacking, which hinders a thorough understanding of the chemical and pharmacological characteristics of this species. Hence, this review is essential to inform researchers and readers about the current state of knowledge in this field. A systematic search was conducted using databases such as Scopus and Google Scholar, yielding 33 relevant articles focusing on the phytochemistry and recent pharmacological investigations of <i>C. lechleri</i>. These studies identify proanthocyanidins as the predominant phytochemical group in terms of relative quantity.

Many of these proteins contain potential targetable sites for the development of antivirals. Despite the widespread use of vaccinations, the emergence of variants necessitates the investigation of new therapeutics and antivirals. Here, the EpiMed Coronabank Chemical Collection (https://epimedlab.org/crl/) was utilized to investigate potential antivirals against the nsp14 exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain. Molecular docking was performed to evaluate the binding characteristics of our chemical library against the nsp14 ExoN site. Based on the initial screen, trisjuglone, ararobinol, corilagin, and naphthofluorescein were identified as potential lead compounds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were subsequently performed, with the results highlighting the stability of the lead compounds in the nsp14 ExoN site. Protein-RNA docking revealed the potential for the lead compounds to disrupt the interaction with RNA when bound to the ExoN site. Moreover, hypericin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and rutin were previously identified as lead compounds targeting the papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>) naphthalene binding site. Through performing MD simulations, the stability and interactions of lead compounds with PL<sup>pro</sup> were further examined. Overall, given the critical role of the exonuclease activity of nsp14 in ensuring viral fidelity and the multifunctional role of PL<sup>pro</sup> in viral pathobiology and replication, these nsps represent important targets for antiviral drug development.

35447229.0,Expansion of the Cosmetics Europe skin sensitisation database with new substances and PPRA data.,"The assessment of skin sensitisation is a key requirement in all regulated sectors, with the European Union's regulation of cosmetic ingredients being most challenging, since it requires quantitative skin sensitisation assessment based on new approach methodologies (NAMs). To address this challenge, an in-depth and harmonised understanding of NAMs is fundamental to inform the assessment. Therefore, we compiled a database of NAMs, and in vivo (human and local lymph node assay) reference data. Here, we expanded this database with 41 substances highly relevant for cosmetic industry. These structurally different substances were tested in six NAMs (Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay, KeratinoSens™, human Cell Line Activation Test, U-SENS™, SENS-IS, Peroxidase Peptide Reactivity Assay). Our analysis revealed that the substances could be tested without technical limitations, but were generally overpredicted when compared to reference results. Reasons for this reduced predictivity were explored through pairwise NAM comparisons and association of overprediction with hydrophobicity. We conclude that more detailed understanding of how NAMs apply to a wider range of substances is needed. This would support a flexible and informed choice of NAMs to be optimally applied in the context of a next generation risk assessment framework, ultimately contributing to the characterisation and reduction of uncertainty.",bio-resource,0.99396026,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35447229,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.40266344,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38145028.0,Screening of Indoor Transformation Products of Organophosphates and Organophosphites with an in Silico Spectral Database.,"Numerous transformation products are formed indoors, but they are outside the scope of current chemical databases. In this study, an in silico spectral database was established to screen previously unknown indoor transformation products of organophosphorus compounds (OPCs). An R package was developed that incorporated four indoor reactions to predict the transformation products of 712 seed OPCs. By further predicting MS<sup>2</sup> fragments, an in silico spectral database was established consisting of 3509 OPCs and 28,812 MS<sup>2</sup> fragments. With this database, 40 OPCs were tentatively detected in 23 indoor dust samples. This is the greatest number of OPCs reported to date indoors, among which two novel phosphonates were validated using standards. Twenty-four of the detected OPCs were predicted transformation products in which oxidation from organophosphites plays a major role. To confirm this, the in silico spectral database was expanded to include organophosphites for suspect screening in five types of preproduction plastics. A broad spectrum of 14 organophosphites was detected, with a particularly high abundance in polyvinyl chloride plastics and indoor end-user goods. This demonstrated the significant contribution of organophosphites to indoor organophosphates via oxidation, highlighting the strength of in silico spectral databases for the screening of unknown indoor transformation products.",bio-resource,0.99153155,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38145028,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.4020412,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The Signature Consortium represents a group of approximately one hundred Quebec-based transdisciplinary clinicians and research scientists with various expertise in the field of psychiatry. The objective of the Signature Biobank is to investigate the multi-faceted underpinnings of psychiatric disorders among patients in crisis. The Signature Consortium is expanding and includes new active members that seek to highlight the contributions made by Signature Biobank since its inception. This article details our research protocol, directions, and summarizes contributions. To date, we have collected biological samples (n = 1,986), and questionnaire data (n = 2,085) from psychiatric emergency patients of the Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal (Quebec, Canada), with a large proportion from whom both data types were collected (n = 1,926). In addition to this, a subsample of patients was followed-up at hospital discharge, and two additional outpatient clinic appointments (n = 958 with at least one follow-up). In addition, a socio-demographically matched comparison group of individuals who were not hospitalized for psychiatric disorders (n = 149) was recruited from the surrounding catchment area. To summarize, a systematic review of the literature shows that the Signature Biobank has contributed to better characterizing psychiatric comorbidities, biological profiles, and psychosocial functioning across some of the most common psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders.

40607027.0,Assessing nutritional composition and ingredients of packaged foods in Brazil: an in-store census method for creating a comprehensive food label database.,"<h4>Background</h4>The consumption of ultra-processed packaged foods has surged worldwide with important health implications. It is pertinent to study the composition of packaged foods through information provided on labels. However, there is limited methodological discussion in the field. This study aimed at discussing methodological evolution and challenges of in-store census methods for assessing the composition of packaged foods, and characterizing a Brazilian food label database.<h4>Methods</h4>The first Brazilian food label database reported in the scientific literature, based on data of in-store census method, was created in 2010 by the Nutrition in Foodservice Research Centre (NUPPRE at the Federal University of Santa Catarina). The in-store census method involves collecting primary data directly from the labels of packaged foods available for sale through retail food outlets. In 2020, the in-store census was carried out in partnership with the FoodSwitch Program. The NUPPRE/FoodSwitch Brazil 2020 database was developed in four steps: pre-data collection, data collection, data tabulation, and database construction and processing. The database was characterized by calculating the prevalence of foods per food group and foods that declared mandatory nutrition and health information on food labels according to Brazilian regulation.<h4>Results</h4>The nutritional profile and ingredients of packaged foods was obtained from four food label censuses (2010, 2011, 2013 and 2020), supporting the Brazilian government on food labeling regulations and public policies. The experience prompted reflections about the methodological aspects of food label studies, and enabled improvements to the research process, such as a more accurate data collection, the inclusion of all packaged foods and beverages available for sale in the supermarket and the inclusion of more variables to the analysis. It is noteworthy the relevance of building nationwide food labeling databases. However, there are important challenges regarding the costs and efforts needed to maintain and update the data, especially in continental countries such as Brazil. The NUPPRE/FoodSwitch Brazil 2020 database consists of 7,828 packaged foods, 94% of the sampled brands sold nationwide. Most foods presented the mandatory information according to Brazilian regulation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study proposed a series of methodological procedures to be carefully considered, designed, and executed during planning, data collection, data tabulation, and database processing.

36064074.0,Comparative RNA-Seq analysis reveals insights in Salmonella disease resistance of chicken; and database development as resource for gene expression in poultry.,"Salmonella, one of the major infectious diseases in poultry, causes considerable economic losses in terms of mortality and morbidity, especially in countries that lack effective vaccination programs. Besides being resistant to diseases, indigenous chicken breeds are also a potential source of animal protein in developing countries. For understanding the disease resistance, an indigenous chicken line Kashmir faverolla, and commercial broiler were selected. RNA-seq was performed after challenging the chicken with Salmonella Typhimurium. Comparative differential expression results showed that following infection, a total of 3153 genes and 1787 genes were differentially expressed in the liver and spleen, respectively. The genes that were differentially expressed included interleukins, cytokines, NOS2, Avβ-defensins, toll-like receptors, and other immune-related gene families. Most of the genes and signaling pathways involved in the innate and adaptive immune responses against bacterial infection were significantly enriched in the Kashmir faverolla. Pathway analysis revealed that most of the enriched pathways were MAPK signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, TLR signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, endocytosis, etc. Surprisingly some immune-related genes like TLRs were upregulated in the susceptible chicken breed. On postmortem examination, the resistant birds showed small lesions in the liver compared to large necrotic lesions in susceptible birds. The pathological manifestations and RNA sequencing results suggest a balancing link between resistance and infection tolerance in Kashmir faverolla. Here we also developed an online Poultry Infection Database (https://skuastk.org/pif/index.html), the first publicly available gene expression resource for disease resistance in chickens. The available database not only shows the data for gene expression in chicken tissues but also provides quick search, visualization and download capacity.",bio-resource,0.99742824,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36064074,1.0,title_pattern; has_url; impl_kw=1; usage_kw=3,False,True,True,1,3,0,0.400336,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

LCPD, a rare disease, is discussed using the Digital Atlas of Ancient Rare Diseases (DAARD), which tests the benefits of the database for diagnosing and contextualizing the new case with 42 archaeological cases of LCPD recorded in the DAARD.<h4>Materials</h4>A 30-40-year-old, probable male individual was found at the archaeological site of Olympia, Greece, dating to 500-700 CE.<h4>Methods</h4>Biological sex, age-at-death and pathological changes were investigated using macroscopic and osteometric methods. The DAARD provided the typical characteristics of LCPD.<h4>Results</h4>Pathological changes in both hip joints without any other related changes in the skeleton corresponded to the skeletal features of LCPD. The DAARD produced 42 cases of LCPD, most of which from Europe, with a preference for male sex and unilateral involvement of the hip joint.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The DAARD aids in diagnosing rare diseases and interpreting new cases in the context of already known studies.<h4>Significance</h4>This study shows that the DAARD has the potential to help researchers move beyond the level of single case studies and create a broader picture of the history of rare diseases.<h4>Limitations</h4>This paper focuses on the benefits of the DAARD in relation to LCPD but not all rare diseases have been included in the database.<h4>Suggestions for further research</h4>More rare diseases from archaeological contexts should be added to the DAARD to create a base for the interpretation of their history and expand our understanding of rare diseases in the past.",bio-resource,0.9183275,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39079280,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.39988282,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37138785.0,Data-Resource Profile: United Kingdom Optimum Patient Care Research Database.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Electronic medical records (EMRs) maintained in primary care in the UK and collected and stored in EMR databases offer a world-leading resource for observational clinical research. We aimed to profile one such database: the Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD).<h4>Methods and participants</h4>The OPCRD, incepted in 2010, is a growing primary care EMR database collecting data from 992 general practices within the UK. It covers over 16.6 million patients across all four countries within the UK, and is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity and socio-economic status. Patients have a mean duration of 11.7 years' follow-up (SD 17.50), with a majority having key summary data from birth to last data entry. Data for the OPCRD are collected incrementally monthly and extracted from all of the major clinical software systems used within the UK and across all four coding systems (Read version 2, Read CTV3, SNOMED DM+D and SNOMED CT codes). Via quality-improvement programmes provided to GP surgeries, the OPCRD also includes patient-reported outcomes from a range of disease-specific validated questionnaires, with over 66,000 patient responses on asthma, COPD, and COVID-19. Further, bespoke data collection is possible by working with GPs to collect new research via patient-reported questionnaires.<h4>Findings to date</h4>The OPCRD has contributed to over 96 peer-reviewed research publications since its inception encompassing a broad range of medical conditions, including COVID-19.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The OPCRD represents a unique resource with great potential to support epidemiological research, from retrospective observational studies through to embedded cluster-randomised trials. Advantages of the OPCRD over other EMR databases are its large size, UK-wide geographical coverage, the availability of up-to-date patient data from all major GP software systems, and the unique collection of patient-reported information on respiratory health.",bio-resource,0.99249226,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37138785,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.39881378,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

37058569.0,A conditional knockout rat resource of mitochondrial protein-coding genes via a DdCBE-induced premature stop codon.,"Hundreds of pathogenic variants of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported to cause mitochondrial diseases, which still lack effective treatments. It is a huge challenge to install these mutations one by one. We repurposed the DddA-derived cytosine base editor to incorporate a premature stop codon in the mtProtein-coding genes to ablate mitochondrial proteins encoded in the mtDNA (mtProteins) instead of installing pathogenic variants and generated a library of both cell and rat resources with mtProtein depletion. In vitro, we depleted 12 of 13 mtProtein-coding genes with high efficiency and specificity, resulting in decreased mtProtein levels and impaired oxidative phosphorylation.

36052994.0,Brain atlas for glycoprotein hormone receptors at single-transcript level.,"There is increasing evidence that anterior pituitary hormones, traditionally thought to have unitary functions in regulating single endocrine targets, act on multiple somatic tissues, such as bone, fat, and liver. There is also emerging evidence for anterior pituitary hormone action on brain receptors in mediating central neural and peripheral somatic functions. Here, we have created the most comprehensive neuroanatomical atlas on the expression of TSHR, LHCGR, and FSHR. We have used RNAscope, a technology that allows the detection of mRNA at single-transcript level, together with protein level validation, to document <i>Tshr</i> expression in 173 and <i>Fshr</i> expression in 353 brain regions, nuclei and subnuclei identified using the <i>Atlas for the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates</i>. We also identified <i>Lhcgr</i> transcripts in 401 brain regions, nuclei and subnuclei. Complementarily, we used ViewRNA, another single-transcript detection technology, to establish the expression of <i>FSHR</i> in human brain samples, where transcripts were co-localized in <i>MALAT1</i>-positive neurons. In addition, we show high expression for all three receptors in the ventricular region-with yet unknown functions. Intriguingly, <i>Tshr</i> and <i>Fshr</i> expression in the ependymal layer of the third ventricle was similar to that of the thyroid follicular cells and testicular Sertoli cells, respectively. In contrast, <i>Fshr</i> was localized to NeuN-positive neurons in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in murine and human brain-both are Alzheimer's disease-vulnerable regions. Our atlas thus provides a vital resource for scientists to explore the link between the stimulation or inactivation of brain glycoprotein hormone receptors on somatic function.

37340399.0,"A genderful research world: rapid review, design, and pilot study of an interactive platform for curated sex and gender health research resources.","<h4>Background</h4>Integration of sex and gender into health research is best practice for designing and conducting equitable, rigorous scientific research. Many evidence-based resources exist to support researchers in this endeavour, but such resources often remain underutilized as they are difficult to find, are not publicly accessible, or are specific to a particular research phase, context, or population. The development and evaluation of a repository of resources was deemed important to create an accessible platform for promoting sex- and gender-integration in health research.<h4>Methods</h4>A rapid review was conducted of critical resources for conducting sex and gender health research. These were integrated into a prototype website design (the Genderful Research World; GRW) that provided an interactive digital landscape for researchers to access these resources. A pilot study evaluated the GRW website for applicability, desirability, and usability with an international sample of 31 health researchers from various disciplines and career stages. Quantitative data from the pilot study was summarized with descriptive statistics. Qualitative data was summarized narratively and used to identify concrete elements for improvement in a second design iteration.<h4>Results</h4>Results of the pilot study revealed that the GRW was considered user friendly and desirable by health researchers and helped them access relevant information. Feedback suggested that providing these resources in a playful way may enhance the experience of the user, particularly given the high 'desirability' scores and that users emphasized the interactive layout as being key to their intention to integrate it into their teaching endeavors. Key feedback from the pilot study (e.g., addition of resources specific to research with transgender populations, revision of website layout) was integrated into the current version of the website: www.genderfulresearchworld.com .<h4>Conclusions</h4>The present research suggests a utility for a repository of resources for integrating sex and gender considerations into research, and that providing a logical, intuitive means of cataloguing and navigating such resources is critical for usability. The results of this study may inform the development of other novel researcher-directed resource curation efforts to address health equity issues and encourage and support health researchers to integrate a sex and gender perspective in their work.",bio-resource,0.65744865,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37340399,1.5,has_url; impl_kw=1,False,False,True,1,0,0,0.39547145,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

35348650.0,Evaluating the predictive accuracy of curated biological pathways in a public knowledgebase.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Reactome is a database of human biological pathways manually curated from the primary literature and peer-reviewed by experts. To evaluate the utility of Reactome pathways for predicting functional consequences of genetic perturbations, we compared predictions of perturbation effects based on Reactome pathways against published empirical observations. Ten cancer-relevant Reactome pathways, representing diverse biological processes such as signal transduction, cell division, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, were selected for testing. For each pathway, root input nodes and key pathway outputs were defined. We then used pathway-diagram-derived logic graphs to predict, either by inspection by biocurators or using a novel algorithm MP-BioPath, the effects of bidirectional perturbations (upregulation/activation or downregulation/inhibition) of single root inputs on the status of key outputs. These predictions were then compared to published empirical tests. In total, 4968 test cases were analyzed across 10 pathways, of which 847 were supported by published empirical findings. Out of the 847 test cases, curators' predictions agreed with the experimental evidence in 670 and disagreed in 177 cases, resulting in ∼81% overall accuracy. MP-BioPath predictions agreed with experimental evidence for 625 and disagreed for 222 test cases, resulting in ∼75% overall accuracy. The expected accuracy of random guessing was 33%. Per-pathway accuracy did not correlate with the number of pathway edges nor the number of pathway nodes but varied across pathways, ranging from 56% (curator)/44% (MP-BioPath) for 'Mitotic G1 phase and G1/S transition' to 100% (curator)/94% (MP-BioPath) for 'RAF/MAP kinase cascade'. This study highlights the potential of pathway databases such as Reactome in modeling genetic perturbations, promoting standardization of experimental pathway activity readout and supporting hypothesis-driven research by revealing relationships between pathway inputs and outputs that have not yet been directly experimentally tested.<h4>Database url</h4>www.reactome.org.",bio-resource,0.95395225,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35348650,0.5,has_url; usage_kw=1,False,False,True,0,1,0,0.3944331,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39175079.0,"SexAnnoDB, a knowledgebase of sex-specific regulations from multi-omics data of human cancers.","<h4>Background</h4>Sexual differences across molecular levels profoundly impact cancer biology and outcomes. Patient gender significantly influences drug responses, with divergent reactions between men and women to the same drugs. Despite databases on sex differences in human tissues, understanding regulations of sex disparities in cancer is limited. These resources lack detailed mechanistic studies on sex-biased molecules.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we conducted a comprehensive examination of molecular distinctions and regulatory networks across 27 cancer types, delving into sex-biased effects. Our analyses encompassed sex-biased competitive endogenous RNA networks, regulatory networks involving sex-biased RNA binding protein-exon skipping events, sex-biased transcription factor-gene regulatory networks, as well as sex-biased expression quantitative trait loci, sex-biased expression quantitative trait methylation, sex-biased splicing quantitative trait loci, and the identification of sex-biased cancer therapeutic drug target genes. All findings from these analyses are accessible on SexAnnoDB ( https://ccsm.uth.edu/SexAnnoDB/ ).<h4>Results</h4>From these analyses, we defined 126 cancer therapeutic target sex-associated genes. Among them, 9 genes showed sex-biased at both the mRNA and protein levels. Specifically, S100A9 was the target of five drugs, of which calcium has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of colon and rectal cancers. Transcription factor (TF)-gene regulatory network analysis suggested that four TFs in the SARC male group targeted S100A9 and upregulated the expression of S100A9 in these patients. Promoter region methylation status was only associated with S100A9 expression in KIRP female patients. Hypermethylation inhibited S100A9 expression and was responsible for the downregulation of S100A9 in these female patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Comprehensive network and association analyses indicated that the sex differences at the transcriptome level were partially the result of corresponding sex-biased epigenetic and genetic molecules. Overall, SexAnnoDB offers a discipline-specific search platform that could potentially assist basic experimental researchers or physicians in developing personalized treatment plans.",bio-resource,0.99835145,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39175079,1.0,has_url,False,False,True,0,0,0,0.3940107,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36618584.0,When a Dust Storm Is Not a Dust Storm: Reliability of Dust Records From the Storm Events Database and Implications for Geohealth Applications.,"Windblown dust impacts human health, air quality, and climate. The National Weather Service Storm Events Database (SED) is a widely used dataset of significant or unusual weather, including dust storms (DS), and resulting deaths, injuries, and material losses in the USA. The SED is frequently used by medical, social, and atmospheric scientists. However, it is uncertain whether this dataset reliably represents spatial and temporal variations and trends of DS. Analyzing the SED from 2000 to 2020 identified 1,167 DS reports; removing reports of the same event from multiple locations left 647 DS in 21 USA states. The number of DS ranged from 12 in 2008 to 53 in 2018, with no strong interannual trends detected (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> was 0.3). By examining the DS events reported in the SED based on meteorological observations including wind speed, visibility, and weather codes, we determined that the SED was not only missing many DS (visibility <1 km), but also included many blowing dust (BLDU) events. 49.9% of 491 reported DS events in SED had visibility >1 km and were incorrectly reported as DS. Underrepresentation of DS and inclusion of BLDU may be partially due to the diverse sources contributing to the SED and a lack of verification of the reports and their consistency. Although the SED is an extremely useful and valuable database of impactful weather, including DS, the issues found in this study warrant caution in use of this dataset for many geohealth applications.",bio-resource,0.5701466,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36618584,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.393618,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Identifying skin manifestations of disease depends on pattern recognition, which is difficult without visual examples. Lack of familiarity with visual diagnosis on skin of color can lead to delayed or missed diagnoses with increased morbidity and mortality. As the United States continues to increase in ethnic and racial diversity, addressing the disparity in health outcomes with education is vital.<h4>Case presentation</h4>At the Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, students, librarians, and faculty came together to address this problem and develop a database of dermatological conditions in people with darker skin tones. A student group initiated a series of meetings with faculty to determine the best approach to address and enhance the representation of diversity in disease images within the curriculum. With the guidance of faculty and librarians, students performed a literature search and created a database of images of skin pathologies in people with darker skin tones. The database was disseminated to course directors and lecturers, and the noted disparities were corrected for the next cohort of students. The database provides an easily accessible resource for creating lecture slides.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This project brought awareness of the need for inclusivity and generated a broad review of the curriculum to be more representative of all patient populations.

39999707.0,Towards site-specific nutrient management strategies: An open database in Senegal.,"Building open databases is critical to creating effective, locally-informed decision support systems in agriculture. In West Africa, particularly in Senegal, the open agricultural data movement is growing but still requires further investment. This review aimed to create an open database by integrating existing data on yield response to nutrient applications for major field crops. From 5026 articles identified in the literature, only 79 were retained (482 experiments, 2992 observations). Many studies lacked treatments to assess individual nutrient effects, had limited control versus NPK comparisons, or were missing critical soil nutrient status. Over 80 % of the database consisted of crops such as rice (41 %), millet (24 %), peanut (10 %), and maize (7 %). A boundary line analysis was conducted to establish critical nutrient thresholds for maximum grain yield for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) rates. The integration of an open soil database together with this literature data layer provided insights into the association of crop yield responses to nutrient applications and their link to the soil nutrient status. For example, rice yield response to N application showed a weak relationship with soil carbon, similar to yield without K application and soil available K, whereas yield without P application was more strongly related to soil available P. This review highlights data limitations such as incomplete field data, insufficient treatments, and difficulties in applying current data to site-specific nutrient management. Future efforts should prioritize not only decision support tools, but also high-quality local data collection with standardized protocols to support reliable decision processes.",bio-resource,0.94438344,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39999707,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.39274713,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) analysis of 19 distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets showed that the expression of over 4000 genes is significantly associated with common genetic polymorphisms and that most of these genes show their most prominent effects in specific cell types. These genes included many that encode for molecules important for activation, differentiation, and effector functions of T cells. We also found new gene associations for disease-risk variants identified from genome-wide association studies and highlighted the cell types in which their effects are most prominent. We found that biological sex has a major influence on activation-dependent gene expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. Sex-biased transcripts were significantly enriched in several pathways that are essential for the initiation and execution of effector functions by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells like TCR signaling, cytokines, cytokine receptors, costimulatory, apoptosis, and cell-cell adhesion pathways.

Identifying causal genetic variants in the <i>F8</i> gene is vital for patient care. Our original interactive MySQL database for FVIII in 2013 presented clinical data on 2014 unique FVIII variants in 5072 patients. Here, we expand our database almost threefold with a new total of 6211 unique FVIII variants in 10 064 patients, spanning 1529 of the 2351 FVIII residues (65%). We have also developed a new full-length FVIII structural model that incorporates both its crystal structure and its disordered B domain, which is not visible in available experimental structures. This enabled the assessment of these variants on FVIII. Of the 6211 unique <i>F8</i> variants identified, 730 (12%) were associated with mild phenotypes, 526 (8%) with moderate phenotypes, 2509 (39%) with severe phenotypes, 53 (1%) with multiple severities, and 2393 (40%) with unreported phenotypes. Most variants occurred in the disordered B domain (1281 variants), followed by the A1, A2, and A3 domains (1130, 1071, and 923 variants, respectively) and the C1 and C2 domains (442 and 439 variants, respectively). Inhibitors were associated with 451 variants (7%). Our new structural analyses often revealed changes to the residue solvent surface accessibilities caused by many FVIII variants.

The most involved site was the skullcap (60.4%), and the most common malignancies were metastases to the bone (65.3%) and multiple myeloma (17.4%). No primary soft tissue malignancies were registered. The results of our study indicate that head and neck cancers were present in ancient civilizations, at least since 500,000 BCE.

35330423.0,Middle Eastern Genetic Variation Improves Clinical Annotation of the Human Genome.,"Genetic variation in populations of Middle Eastern origin remains highly underrepresented in most comprehensive genomic databases. This underrepresentation hampers the functional annotation of the human genome and challenges accurate clinical variant interpretation. To highlight the importance of capturing genetic variation in the Middle East, we aggregated whole exome and genome sequencing data from 2116 individuals in the Middle East and established the Middle East Variation (MEV) database. Of the high-impact coding (missense and loss of function) variants in this database, 53% were absent from the most comprehensive Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), thus representing a unique Middle Eastern variation dataset which might directly impact clinical variant interpretation. We highlight 39 variants with minor allele frequency >1% in the MEV database that were previously reported as rare disease variants in ClinVar and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Furthermore, the MEV database consisted of 281 putative homozygous loss of function (LoF) variants, or complete knockouts, of which 31.7% (89/281) were absent from gnomAD. This set represents either complete knockouts of 83 unique genes in reportedly healthy individuals, with implications regarding disease penetrance and expressivity, or might affect dispensable exons, thus refining the clinical annotation of those regions. Intriguingly, 24 of those genes have several clinically significant variants reported in ClinVar and/or HGMD. Our study shows that genetic variation in the Middle East improves functional annotation and clinical interpretation of the genome and emphasizes the need for expanding sequencing studies in the Middle East and other underrepresented populations.",bio-resource,0.9925995,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35330423,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.38849884,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38706955.0,Integrated analysis of public datasets for the discovery and validation of survival-associated genes in solid tumors.,"Identifying genes with prognostic significance that can act as biomarkers in solid tumors can help stratify patients and uncover novel therapy targets. Here, our goal was to expand our previous ranking analysis of survival-associated genes in various solid tumors to include colon cancer specimens with available transcriptomic and clinical data. A Gene Expression Omnibus search was performed to identify available datasets with clinical data and raw gene expression measurements. A combined database was set up and integrated into our Kaplan-Meier plotter, making it possible to identify genes with expression changes linked to altered survival. As a demonstration of the utility of the platform, the most powerful genes linked to overall survival in colon cancer were identified using uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The combined colon cancer database includes 2,137 tumor samples from 17 independent cohorts. The most significant genes associated with relapse-free survival with a false discovery rate below 1% in colon cancer carcinoma were <i>RBPMS</i> (hazard rate [HR] = 2.52), <i>TIMP1</i> (HR = 2.44), and <i>COL4A2</i> (HR = 2.36). The three strongest genes associated with shorter survival in stage II colon cancer include <i>CSF1R</i> (HR = 2.86), <i>FLNA</i> (HR = 2.88), and <i>TPBG</i> (HR = 2.65). In summary, a new integrated database for colon cancer is presented. A colon cancer analysis subsystem was integrated into our Kaplan-Meier plotter that can be used to mine the entire database (https://www.kmplot.com). The portal has the potential to be employed for the identification and prioritization of promising biomarkers and therapeutic target candidates in multiple solid tumors including, among others, breast, lung, ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, and colon cancers.",bio-resource,0.7722789,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38706955,0.5,has_url; usage_kw=1,False,False,True,0,1,0,0.38821563,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36822265.0,An atlas of expression quantitative trait loci of microRNAs in longissimus muscle of eight-way crossbred pigs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of myocyte development and traits, yet insight into the genetic basis of variation in miRNA expression is still limited. Here, we present a systematic analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for miRNA profiling in longissimus muscle of pigs from an eight-breed crossed heterogeneous population. By integrating the whole-genome sequencing and miRNAomics data, we map 54 cis- and 292 trans-eQTLs at high resolution that are associated with the expression of 54 and 92 miRNAs, respectively. Twenty-three trans-acting loci are identified to affect the expression of nine myomiRs (known muscle-specific miRNAs). MiRNAs in mammalian conserved miRNA clusters are found to be subjected to regulation by shared cis-eQTLs, while the expression of mature miRNA-5p/-3p counterparts is more likely to be regulated by different cis-eQTLs. Fine mapping and bioinformatics analyses pinpoint the peak cis-eSNP of miR-4331-5p, rs344650810, which is located in its seed region, as a causal variant for the changes in expression and function of this miRNA. Additionally, rs344650810 is significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with the density and percentage of type I muscle fibers. Altogether, this study provides a comprehensive atlas of miRNA-eQTLs in porcine skeletal muscle and new insights into regulatory mechanisms of miRNA expression.",bio-resource,0.82750165,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36822265,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.3877719,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

To address this, the Movember Global Action Plan 1 Unique tissue microarray (GAP1-UTMA) project constructed a set of unique and richly annotated tissue microarrays (TMA) from prostate cancer samples obtained from multiple institutions across several global locations.<h4>Methods</h4>Three separate TMA sets were built that differ by purpose and disease state.<h4>Results</h4>The intended use of TMA1 (Primary Matched LN) is to validate biomarkers that help determine which clinically localized prostate cancers with associated lymph node metastasis have a high risk of progression to lethal castration-resistant metastatic disease, and to compare molecular properties of high-risk index lesions within the prostate to regional lymph node metastases resected at the time of prostatectomy. TMA2 (Pre vs. Post ADT) was designed to address questions regarding risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and response to suppression of the androgen receptor/androgen axis, and characterization of the castration-resistant phenotype. TMA3 (CRPC Met Heterogeneity)'s intended use is to assess the heterogeneity of molecular markers across different anatomic sites in lethal prostate cancer metastases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The GAP1-UTMA project has succeeded in combining a large set of tissue specimens from 501 patients with prostate cancer with rich clinical annotation.<h4>Impact</h4>This resource is now available to the prostate cancer community as a tool for biomarker validation to address important unanswered clinical questions around disease progression and response to treatment.",bio-resource,0.6490283,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35131885,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.38776878,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38932564.0,Capitalizing on genebank core collections for rare and novel disease resistance loci to enhance barley resilience.,"In the realm of agricultural sustainability, the utilization of plant genetic resources for enhanced disease resistance is paramount. Preservation efforts in genebanks are justified by their potential contributions to future crop improvement. To capitalize on the potential of plant genetic resources, we focused on a barley core collection from the German ex situ genebank and contrasted it with a European elite collection. The phenotypic assessment included 812 plant genetic resources and 298 elites, with a particular emphasis on four disease traits (Puccinia hordei, Blumeria graminis hordei, Ramularia collo-cygni, and Rhynchosporium commune). An integrated genome-wide association study, employing both Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK) and a linear mixed model, was performed to unravel the genetic underpinnings of disease resistance. A total of 932 marker-trait associations were identified and assigned to 49 quantitative trait loci. The accumulation of novel and rare resistance alleles significantly bolstered the overall resistance level in plant genetic resources. Three plant genetic resources donors with high counts of novel/rare alleles and exhibiting exceptional resistance to leaf rust and powdery mildew were identified, offering promise for targeted pre-breeding goals and enhanced resilience in future varieties. Our findings underscore the critical contribution of plant genetic resources to strengthening crop resilience and advancing sustainable agricultural practices.",bio-resource,0.9445369,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38932564,0.0,impl_kw=1; usage_kw=1,False,False,False,1,1,0,0.3875723,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39223350.0,An atlas of genetic effects on cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment.,"Deciphering the composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for understanding tumorigenesis and to design immunotherapies. In the present study, we mapped genetic effects on cell-type proportions using single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data, identifying 3,494 immunity quantitative trait loci (immunQTLs) across 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Functional annotation revealed regulatory potential and we further assigned 1,668 genes that regulate TME composition. We constructed a combined immunQTL map by integrating data from European and Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) samples. A polygenic risk score that incorporates these immunQTLs and hits on a genome-wide association study outperformed in CRC risk stratification within 447,495 multiethnic individuals. Using large-scale population cohorts, we identified that the immunQTL rs1360948 is associated with CRC risk and prognosis. Mechanistically, the rs1360948-G-allele increases CCL2 expression, recruiting regulatory T cells that can exert immunosuppressive effects on CRC progression. Blocking the CCL2-CCR2 axis enhanced anti-programmed cell death protein 1 ligand therapy.

This study developed a Chinese Food Life Cycle Assessment Database (CFLCAD) in which Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) for 80 food items, Water Use (WU) for 93 food items and Land Use (LU) for 50 food items were collected through a literature review. To estimate the environmental footprints of food from production to consumption, the study applied conversion factors for the edible portion of food, food loss ratio and processing, storage, packaging, transportation, and food preparation stages. In addition, when no LCA data of a certain food was available, data from food groups with similar nutritional composition or cultivation condition were used as proxies. The database covered 17 food groups and each food item was referenced to the Chinese Food Composition Table and has a unique food code. The CFLCAD can be used to link individual-level food consumption data with nutrition survey in China, to allow for a more accurate estimation of the environmental footprints of Chinese diets.",bio-resource,0.8940749,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35599819,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.38546163,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

37577282.0,The International SCN8A Patient Registry: A Scientific Resource to Advance the Understanding and Treatment of a Rare Pediatric Neurodevelopmental Syndrome.,"Genetic variants in the <i>SCN8A</i> gene underlie a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes that range from severe epileptic encephalopathy to benign familial infantile epilepsy to neurodevelopmental delays with or without seizures. A host of additional comorbidities also contribute to the phenotypic spectrum. As a result of the recent identification of the genetic etiology and the length of time it often takes to diagnose patients, little data are available on the natural history of these conditions. The International SCN8A Patient Registry was developed in 2015 to fill gaps in understanding the spectrum of the disease and its natural history, as well as the lived experiences of individuals with SCN8A syndrome. Another goal of the registry is to collect longitudinal data from participants on a regular basis.

35873634.0,Construction of a Meta-Evidence Prototype Database of Traditional Chinese Medicine Splenogastric Diseases and Its Application in an Automatic Meta-Analysis System.,"<h4>Background</h4>Traditional Chinese medicine splenogastric diseases (TCMSDs) are equivalent to digestive system diseases in modern medicine. The forms of clinical evidence of TCMSDs include clinical trials, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs). SRs mainly rely on manual operations and have the shortcomings of time consumption and low efficiency; therefore, they cannot meet the needs of rapid clinical decision-making. It is urgent to establish a new and smart form of a database to support the progress of SRs.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched and screened all TCMSD RCT reports, in both Chinese and English, and extracted them into meta-evidence through predesigned structural Microsoft Excel tables. All meta-evidence was imported into an online clinical meta-evidence collection and management system after data quality checking. The meta-evidence database of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) splenogastric disease (MED-TCMSD) was then tested as a backend of an automatic meta-analysis system.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 405 cases of TCMSD RCTs were processed into meta-evidence. The most common diseases were stomach stuffiness disease, epigastralgia, and chronic atrophic gastritis. Banxiaxiexin decoction and its modifications were the most used interventions. More than half of the cases employed TCM in conjunction with regular therapeutics. The top reported outcomes included clinical effects, adverse events, and TCM syndromes. The MED-TCMSD worked well as a part of the automatic meta-analysis system.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed and tested a new form of clinical evidence, meta-evidence, for automatic SR and fast evidence-based decision-making. As an example of the MED, the MED-TCMSD can improve the production and updating efficiency of the evidence of TCMSDs. The methods of constructing the MED-TCMSD can be further applied to the development of MEDs of other diseases.",bio-resource,0.9649245,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35873634,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.38457724,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

39614828.0,"Rationale, objectives and design of a national prospective database for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: the Australian Myositis Registry.","<h4>Background</h4>Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a group of autoimmune diseases characterised by inflammation of skeletal muscle and other organ systems. They have high morbidity and mortality but, in part because of their rarity and heterogeneity, improving understanding and outcomes remains challenging. To address these problems, numerous IIM registries exist globally, but no national registry yet exists in Australia.<h4>Aims</h4>The Australian Myositis Registry (AMR) is a national prospective cohort database designed to record clinical, laboratory and patient-experience data of Australian IIM patients with the potential for wide-reaching research impact.<h4>Methods</h4>The AMR was built on the Research Electronic Data Capture secure database system. An extensive set of data fields informed by a contemporary understanding of IIM pathogenesis and clinically relevant features are available to help capture the full breadth of disease phenotype and treatment. Data fields include current classification criteria, all currently available autoantibodies and the internationally accepted core set measures.

36472426.0,Detection and Typing of Plasmids in Acinetobacter baumannii Using <i>rep</i> Genes Encoding Replication Initiation Proteins.,"Plasmids found in Acinetobacter species contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. They appear to be largely confined to this genus and cannot be typed with available tools and databases. Here, a method for distinguishing and typing these plasmids was developed using a curated, non-redundant set of 621 complete sequences of plasmids from Acinetobacter baumannii. Plasmids were separated into 3 groups based on the Pfam domains of the encoded replication initiation (Rep) protein and a fourth group that lack an identifiable Rep protein. The <i>rep</i> genes of each Rep-encoding group (<i>n</i> = 13 Rep_1, <i>n</i> = 107 RepPriCT_1, <i>n</i> = 351 Rep_3) were then clustered using a threshold of >95% nucleotide identity to define 80 distinct types. Five Rep_1 subgroups, designated R1_T1 to R1-T5, were identified and a sixth reported recently was added. Each R1 type corresponded to a conserved small plasmid sequence. The RepPriCT_1 plasmids fell into 5 subgroups, designated RP-T1 to RP-T5 and the Rep_3 plasmids comprised 69 distinct types (R3-T1 to R3-T69). Three R1, 2 RP and 32 R3 types are represented by only a single plasmid. Over half of the plasmids belong to the 4 most abundant types: the RP-T1 plasmids (<i>n</i> = 97), which include conjugation genes and are often associated with various acquired antibiotic resistance genes, and R3-T1, R3-T2 and R3-T3 (<i>n</i> = 95, 30 and 45, respectively). To facilitate typing and the identification of plasmids in draft genomes using this framework, we established the Acinetobacter Typing database containing representative nucleotide and protein sequences of the type markers (https://github.com/MehradHamidian/AcinetobacterPlasmidTyping). <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Though they contribute to the dissemination of genes that confer resistance to clinically important carbapenem and aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat life-threatening Acinetobacter baumannii infections, plasmids found in Acinetobacter species have not been well studied. As these plasmids do not resemble those found in other Gram-negative pathogens, available typing systems are unsuitable. The plasmid typing system developed for A. baumannii plasmids with an identifiable <i>rep</i> gene will facilitate the classification and tracking of sequenced plasmids. It will also enable the detection of plasmid-derived contigs present in draft genomes that are widely ignored currently. Hence, it will assist in the tracking of resistance genes and other genes that affect survival in the environment, as they spread through the population. As identical or similar plasmids have been found in other Acinetobacter species, the typing system will also be broadly applicable in identifying plasmids in other members of the genus.",bio-resource,0.9790435,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36472426,1.5,has_url; impl_kw=1,False,False,True,1,0,0,0.38337803,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38397238.0,De Novo Genome Assembly of the Whitespot Parrotfish (<i>Scarus forsteni</i>): A Valuable Scaridae Genomic Resource.,"<i>Scarus forsteni</i>, a whitespot parrotfish from the Scaridae family, is a herbivorous fish inhabiting coral reef ecosystems. The deterioration of coral reefs has highly affected the habitats of the parrotfish. The decline in genetic diversity of parrotfish emphasizes the critical importance of conserving their genetic variability to ensure the resilience and sustainability of marine ecosystems for future generations. In this study, a genome of <i>S. forsteni</i> was assembled de novo through using Illumina and Nanopore sequencing. The 1.71-Gb genome of <i>S. forsteni</i>, was assembled into 544 contigs (assembly level: contig). It exhibited an N50 length of 17.97 Mb and a GC content percentage of 39.32%. Our BUSCO analysis revealed that the complete protein of the <i>S. forsteni</i> genome had 98.10% integrity. Combined with structure annotation data, 34,140 (74.81%) genes were functionally annotated out of 45,638 predicted protein-coding genes. Upon comparing the genome size and TE content of teleost fishes, a roughly linear relationship was observed between these two parameters. However, TE content is not a decisive factor in determining the genome size of <i>S. forsteni</i>. Population history analysis results indicate that <i>S. forsteni</i> experienced two major population expansions, both of which occurred before the last interglacial period. In addition, through a comparative genomic analysis of the evolutionary relationship of other species, it was found that <i>S. forsteni</i> had the closest relationship with <i>Cheilinus undulatus</i>, another member of the Labridae family. Our expansion and contraction analysis of the gene family showed that the expansion genes were mainly associated with immune diseases, organismal systems, and cellular processes. At the same time, cell transcription and translation, sex hormone regulation, and other related pathways were also more prominent in the positive selection genes. The genomic sequence of <i>S. forsteni</i> offers valuable resources for future investigations on the conservation, evolution, and behavior of fish species.",bio-resource,0.93348914,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38397238,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.38278344,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

In this study, we develop a Chinese Werewolf Deception Database (C2W2D), which consists of 168 video clips (84 deception videos and 84 honest videos). A total of 1,738,760 frames of facial data are recorded. Fifty-eight healthy undergraduates (24 men and 34 women) and 26 drug addicts (26 men) participated in a werewolf game. The development of C2W2D is accomplished based on a ""werewolf"" deception game paradigm in which the participants spontaneously tell the truth or a lie. Two synced high-speed cameras are used to capture the game process. To explore the differences between lying and truth-telling in the database, descriptive statistics (e.g., duration and quantity) and hypothesis tests are conducted using action units (AUs) of facial expressions (e.g., <i>t</i>-test).

Consequently, quantitative changes in metabolite levels have the potential to predict mode-of-action and adversity, with regulatory toxicology predicated on the latter. However, toxicity-related metabolic biomarker resources remain highly fragmented and incomplete. Although development of the S1500+ gene biomarker panel has accelerated the application of transcriptomics to toxicology, a similar initiative for metabolic biomarkers is lacking. Our aim was to define a publicly available metabolic biomarker panel, equivalent to S1500+, capable of predicting pathway perturbations and/or adverse outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of multiple toxicological resources, yielding 189 proposed metabolic biomarkers from existing assays (BASF, Bowes-44, and Tox21), 342 biomarkers from databases (Adverse Outcome Pathway Wiki, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, and Toxin and Toxin-Target Database), and 435 biomarkers from the literature. Evidence mapping across all 8 resources generated a panel of 722 metabolic biomarkers for toxicology (MTox700+), of which 462 (64%) are associated with molecular pathways and 575 (80%) with adverse outcomes. Comparing MTox700+ and S1500+ revealed that 418 (58%) metabolic biomarkers associate with pathways shared across both panels, with further metabolites mapping to unique pathways. Metabolite reference standards are commercially available for 646 (90%) of the panel metabolites, and assays exist for 578 (80%) of these biomarkers. This study has generated a publicly available metabolic biomarker panel for toxicology, which through its future laboratory deployment, is intended to help build foundational knowledge to support the generation of molecular mechanistic data for chemical hazard assessment.",bio-resource,0.6103012,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35094093,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.3810773,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

A varied category of non-coding RNAs is comprised of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). These ncRNAs were once considered non-functional ""junk DNA"" but research now shows they play important roles in gene expression regulation, chromatin modification, and epigenetic regulation. The systemic tissue-specific research of the lncRNAs and circRNAs of <i>C. carpio</i> is yet unexplored. A total of 468 raw RNA-Seq dataset across 28 distinct tissues from different varieties of common carp retrieved from public domain were pre-processing, mapped and assembled for lncRNA identification/ classification using various bioinformatics tools. A total of 33,990 lncRNAs were identified along with revelation of 9 miRNAs having 19 unique lncRNAs acting as their precursors. Additionally, 2,837 miRNAs were found to target 4,782 distinct lncRNAs in the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network analysis, which resulted in the involvement of 3,718 mRNAs in common carp. A total of 22,854 circRNAs were identified tissue-wise across all the 28 tissues. Moreover, the examination of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network revealed that 15,731 circRNAs were targeted by 5,906 distinct miRNAs, which in turn targeted 4,524 mRNAs in common carp.

35053399.0,"Structure and Function of the <i>ABCD1</i> Variant Database: 20 Years, 940 Pathogenic Variants, and 3400 Cases of Adrenoleukodystrophy.","The progressive neurometabolic disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is caused by pathogenic variants in the <i>ABCD1</i> gene, which encodes the peroxisomal ATP-binding transporter for very-long-chain fatty acids. The clinical spectrum of ALD includes adrenal insufficiency, myelopathy, and/or leukodystrophy. A complicating factor in disease management is the absence of a genotype-phenotype correlation in ALD. Since 1999, most <i>ABCD1</i> (likely) pathogenic and benign variants have been reported in the <i>ABCD1</i> Variant Database. In 2017, following the expansion of ALD newborn screening, the database was rebuilt. To add an additional level of confidence with respect to pathogenicity, for each variant, it now also reports the number of cases identified and, where available, experimental data supporting the pathogenicity of the variant. The website also provides information on a number of ALD-related topics in several languages. Here, we provide an updated analysis of the known variants in <i>ABCD1</i>. The order of pathogenic variant frequency, overall clustering of disease-causing variants in exons 1-2 (transmembrane domain spanning region) and 6-9 (ATP-binding domain), and the most commonly reported pathogenic variant p.Gln472Argfs*83 in exon 5 are consistent with the initial reports of the mutation database. Novel insights include nonrandom clustering of high-density missense variant hotspots within exons 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.

39963438.0,The Slovenian translational platform GlioBank for brain tumor research: Identification of molecular signatures of glioblastoma progression.,"<h4>Background</h4>Glioblastoma (GB) is one of the most lethal solid tumors in humans, with an average patient life expectancy of 15 months and a 5-year survival rate of 5%-10%. GB is still uncurable due to tumor heterogeneity and invasive nature as well as therapy-resistant cancer cells. Centralized biobanks with clinical data and corresponding biological material of GB patients facilitate the development of new treatment approaches and the search for clinically relevant biomarkers, with the goal of improving outcomes for GB patients. The aim of this study was firstly to establish a Slovenian translation platform, GlioBank, and secondly to demonstrate its utility through the identification of molecular signatures associated with GB progression and patient survival.<h4>Methods</h4>GlioBank contains tissue samples and corresponding tumor models as well as clinical data from patients diagnosed with glioma, with a focus on GB. Primary GB cells, glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), and organoids have been established from fresh tumor biopsies. We performed expression analyses of genes associated with GB progression and bioinformatics analyses of available clinical and research data obtained from a subset of 91 GB patients. qPCR was performed to determine the expression of genes associated with therapy resistance and cancer cell invasion, including markers of different GB subtypes, GSCs, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and immunomodulation/chemokine signaling in tumor tissues and corresponding cellular models.<h4>Results</h4>GlioBank contains biological material and research, and clinical data collected in the SciNote electronic laboratory notebook. To date, more than 240 glioma tissue samples have been collected and stored in GlioBank, most of which are GB tissues (205) and were further processed to establish primary GB cells (<i>n</i> = 64), GSCs (<i>n</i> = 14), and GB organoids (<i>n</i> = 17). Corresponding blood plasma (<i>n</i> = 103) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<i>n</i> = 101) are also stored. GB tumors were classified into 4 different subtypes that differed regarding patient survival; the mixed subtype exhibited the longest patient survival. High <i>DAB2, S100A4</i>, and <i>STAT3</i> expression were associated with poor overall patient survival, and <i>DAB2</i> was found to be an independent prognostic marker for GB survival. We analyzed the molecular signatures between different tumor regions (core vs. rim). <i>STMN4, ERBB3</i>, and <i>ACSBG1</i> were upregulated in the tumor rim, suggesting that these genes are associated with the invasive nature of GB.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GlioBank is a centralized biobank that has been built by a multidisciplinary network with the aim of facilitating disease-oriented basic and clinical research. The advantages of GlioBank include the molecular characterization of GB based on targeted gene expression, the availability of diverse cellular models (eg, GB cells and organoids), and a large number of patient-matched tumor core and rim samples, all with accompanying molecular and clinical data. We report here for the first time an association between <i>DAB2</i> expression and low overall survival in GB patients, indicative of a prognostic value of <i>DAB2</i>.",bio-resource,0.99458224,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39963438,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.3799495,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Therefore, this bacterium is a paradigmatic example of a pathogen to be controlled by a One Health approach. Indeed, the zoonotic and reverse-zoonotic potential of the bacteria, the prevalence of Group B Streptococci (GBS) diseases in both human and animal domains, and the threatening global situation on GBS antibiotic resistance make these bacteria an important target for control programs. An epidemiological analysis using a public database containing sequences of <i>S. agalactiae</i> from all over the world was conducted to evaluate the frequency and evolution of antibiotic resistance genes in those isolates. The database we considered (NCBI pathogen detection isolate browser-NPDIB) is maintained on a voluntary basis. Therefore, it does not follow strict epidemiological criteria. However, it may be considered representative of the bacterial population related to human diseases. The results showed that the number of reported sequences increased largely in the last four years, and about 50% are of European origin. The frequency data and the cluster analysis showed that the AMR genes increased in frequency in recent years and suggest the importance of verifying the application of prudent protocols for antimicrobials in areas with an increasing frequency of GBS infections both in human and veterinary medicine.",bio-resource,0.7496113,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36140016,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.37939742,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The present study aims to establish a solid association between gene expression and patient survival outcomes to enhance the utility of the Human Pathology Atlas for cancer research.<h4>Methods</h4>In this updated analysis, we examined the expression profiles of 6918 patients across 21 cancer types. We integrated data from 10 independent cancer cohorts, creating a cross-validated, reliable collection of prognostic genes. We applied systems biology approach to identify the association between gene expression profiles and patient survival outcomes. We further constructed prognostic regulatory networks for kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), which elucidate the molecular underpinnings associated with patient survival in these cancers.<h4>Findings</h4>We observed that gene expression during the transition from normal to tumorous tissue exhibited diverse shifting patterns in their original tissue locations. Significant correlations between gene expression and patient survival outcomes were identified in KIRC and LIHC among the major cancer types. Additionally, the prognostic regulatory network established for these two cancers showed the indicative capabilities of the Human Pathology Atlas and provides actionable insights for cancer research.<h4>Interpretation</h4>The updated Human Pathology Atlas provides a significant foundation for precision oncology and the formulation of personalized treatment strategies. These findings deepen our understanding of cancer biology and have the potential to advance targeted therapeutic approaches in clinical practice.<h4>Funding</h4>The Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (72110), the China Scholarship Council (Grant No. 202006940003).",bio-resource,0.9303082,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39662180,0.0,title_pattern; usage_kw=2,False,True,False,0,2,0,0.37785354,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

36452106.0,CGIAR Barley Breeding Toolbox: A diversity panel to facilitate breeding and genomic research in the developing world.,"Breeding programs in developing countries still cannot afford the new genotyping technologies, hindering their research. We aimed to assemble an Association Mapping panel to serve as CGIAR Barley Breeding Toolbox (CBBT), especially for the Developing World. The germplasm had to be representative of the one grown in the Developing World; with high genetic variability and be of public domain. For it, we genotyped with the Infinium iSelect 50K chip, a Global Barley Panel (GBP) of 530 genotypes representing a wide range of row-types, end-uses, growth habits, geographical origins and environments. 40,342 markers were polymorphic with an average polymorphism information content of 0.35 and 66% of them exceeding 0.25. The analysis of the population structure identified 8 subpopulations mostly linked to geographical origin, four of them with significant ICARDA origin. The 16 allele combinations at 4 major flowering genes (HvVRN-H3, HvPPD-H1, HvVRN-H1 and HvCEN) explained 11.07% genetic variation and were linked to the geographic origins of the lines. ICARDA material showed the widest diversity as revealed by the highest number of polymorphic loci (99.76% of all polymorphic SNPs in GBP), number of private alleles and the fact that ICARDA lines were present in all 8 subpopulations and carried all 16 allelic combinations. Due to their genetic diversity and their representativity of the germplasm adapted to the Developing World, ICARDA-derived lines and cultivated landraces were pre-selected to form the CBBT. Using the Mean of Transformed Kinships method, we assembled a panel capturing most of the allelic diversity in the GBP. The CBBT (N=250) preserves good balance between row-types and good representation of both phenology allelic combinations and subpopulations of the GBP. The CBBT and its genotypic data is available to researchers worldwide as a collaborative tool to underpin the genetic mechanisms of traits of interest for barley cultivation.",bio-resource,0.6770667,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36452106,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.37703714,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39213211.0,Comprehensive analysis of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA network in renal cell carcinoma based on GEO database.,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) ranks among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality. Despite extensive research, the precise etiology and progression of RCC remain incompletely elucidated. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been identified as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) capable of binding to microRNA (miRNA) sites, thereby modulating the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNA) and target genes. This regulatory network is known to exert a pivotal influence on cancer initiation and progression. However, the specific role and functional significance of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network in RCC remain poorly understood. The RCC transcriptome data was obtained from the gene expression omnibus database. The identification of differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (DElncRNAs), differentially expressed miRNAs, and differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) between RCC and corresponding paracancer tissues was performed using the ""Limma"" package in R 4.3.1 software. We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify the key DElncRNAs that are most relevant to RCC. Subsequently, we utilized the encyclopedia of RNA interactomes database to predict the interactions between these DElncRNAs and miRNAs, and the miRDB database to predict the interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs. Therefore, key DElncRNAs were obtained to verify the expression of their related genes in the The Cancer Genome Atlas database and to analyze the prognosis. The construction of RCC-specific lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was carried out using Cytoscape 3.7.0. A total of 286 DElncRNAs, 56 differentially expressed miRNAs, and 2065 DEmRNAs were identified in RCC. Seven key DElncRNAs (GAS6 antisense RNA 1, myocardial infarction associated transcript, long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 921, MMP25 antisense RNA 1, Chromosome 22 Open Reading Frame 34, MIR34A host gene, MIR4435-2 host gene) were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis and encyclopedia of RNA interactomes databases. Subsequently, a network diagram comprising 217 nodes and 463 edges was constructed based on these key DElncRNAs. The functional analysis of DEmRNAs in the ceRNA network was conducted using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and gene ontology. We constructed RCC-specific ceRNA networks and identified the crucial lncRNAs associated with RCC using bioinformatics analysis, which will help us further understand the pathogenesis of this disease.",bio-resource,0.77816373,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39213211,0.0,title_pattern; usage_kw=2,False,True,False,0,2,0,0.3770326,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Begun in 1987, this database now includes more than 91,000 infants, most of whom are extremely preterm (<29 weeks gestation). The GDB has been the backbone of the NRN, providing high quality, prospectively collected data to study the changing epidemiology of extreme prematurity and its outcomes over time. In addition, GDB data have been used to generate hypotheses for prospective studies and to develop new clinical trials by providing information about the numbers and characteristics of available subjects and the expected event rates for conditions and complications to be studied. Since its inception, the GDB has been the basis of more than 200 publications in peer-reviewed journals, many of which have had a significant impact on the field of neonatology.",bio-resource,0.99518174,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35835615,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.37699863,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38728989.0,Correlations and impact of anaerobic digestion operating parameters on the start-up duration: Database construction for robust start-up guidelines.,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) has become a popular technique for organic waste management while offering economic and environmental advantages. As AD becomes increasingly prevalent worldwide, research efforts are primarily focused on optimizing its processes. During the operation of AD systems, the occurrence of unstable events is inevitable. So far, numerous conclusions have been drawn from full and lab-scale studies regarding the driving factors of start-up perturbations. However, the lack of standardized practices reported in start-up studies raises concerns about the comparability and reliability of obtained data. This study aims to develop a knowledge database and investigate the possibility of applying machine learning techniques on experimentation-extracted data to assist start-up planning and monitoring. Thus, a standardized database referencing 75 cases of start-up of one-stage wet continuously-stirred tank reactors (CSTR) processing agricultural, industrial, or municipal organic effluent in mono-digestion from 31 studies was constructed. 10 % of the total observations included in this database concern failed start-up experiments. Then, correlations between the parameters and their impacts on the start-up duration were studied using multivariate analysis and a model-based ranking methodology. Insights into trends of choices were highlighted through the correlation analysis of the database. As such, scenarios favoring short start-up duration were found to involve relatively low retention times (average initial and final hydraulic retention times, (HRT<sub>i</sub>) and (HRT<sub>f</sub>) of 26.25 and 20.6 days, respectively), high mean organic loading rates (average OLR<sub>mean</sub> of 5.24 g VS·d<sup>-1</sup>·L <sup>-1</sup>) and the processing of highly fermentable substrates (average feed volatile solids (VS<sub>feed</sub>) of 81.35 g L<sup>-1</sup>). The model-based ranking of AD parameters demonstrated that the HRT<sub>f</sub>, the VS<sub>feed</sub>, and the target temperature (T<sub>f</sub>) have the strongest impact on the start-up duration, receiving the highest relative scores among the evaluated AD parameters. The database could serve as a reference for comparison purposes of future start-up studies allowing the identification of factors that should be closely controlled.",bio-resource,0.5897654,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38728989,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.37676933,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39894535.0,Construction and evaluation of an open-source database for inhalation-based physiologically based kinetic modeling of selected categories for industrial chemicals.,"A physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model is used for predicting chemical concentrations of toxicological concern in target tissues. Such models are important for understanding toxicokinetics. However, it is challenging to obtain chemical-specific empirical parameter values used for PBK modeling. Thus, developing methods predicting these values is necessary. Herein, we researched PBK models of inhalation exposure to industrial chemicals and developed a database of parameters of approximately 200 chemicals in humans and rodents. Next, the chemicals in the database were classified into three categories (I, IIA, and IIB) based on the intermolecular interactions for humans and rats. Quantitative relationships between blood/air and tissue/blood partition coefficients and physicochemical parameters were derived for the chemicals in each category. Regression analyses of blood/air and fat/blood partition coefficients against Henry's law constant and log D at pH 7.4 for chemicals in category IIA for humans, in which van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions were involved, yielded 0.88 and 0.54 coefficients of determination, respectively. Moreover, these methods worked for other categories and species. The metabolic parameters maximal velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of the chemicals that are primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 were calculated for humans and rats. Multiple regression analyses of logs Vmax and Km against the occurrence frequency of molecular fragments showed good correlations, respectively. The aforementioned models predicted values close to the reported values for test chemicals within the applicability domains. Our approach could also be applied to other chemicals within the domains that are not included in the database.",bio-resource,0.98144364,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39894535,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.37628844,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39944804.0,Computer analysis shows differences between mitochondrial miRNAs and other miRNAs.,"A subclass of miRNAs with as yet unknown specific functions is mitomiRs - mitochondrial miRNAs that are mainly derived from nuclear DNA and are imported into mitochondria; moreover, changes in the expression levels of mitomiRs are associated with some diseases. To identify the most pronounced characteristics of mitochondrial miRNAs that distinguish them from other miRNAs, we classified mitomiR sequences using the Random Forest algorithm. The analysis revealed, for the first time, a significant difference between mitomiRs and other microRNAs by the following criteria (in descending order of importance in the classification): mitomiRs are evolutionarily older (have a lower phylostratigraphic age index, PAI); have more targets and disease associations, including mitochondrial ones (two-sided Fisher's exact test, average p-values 1.82 × 10-89/1.13 × 10-96 for all mRNA/diseases and 6.01 × 10-22/1.09 × 10-9 for mitochondria, respectively); and are in the class of ""circulating"" miRNAs (average p- value 1.20 × 10-56). The identified differences between mitomiRs and other miRNAs may help uncover the mode of miRNA delivery into mitochondria, indicate the evolutionary conservation and importance of mitomiRs in the regulation of mitochondrial function and metabolism, and generally show that mitomiRs are not randomly encountered miRNAs.

40205134.0,"A lexical database of British Sign Language (BSL) and German Sign Language (DGS): Iconicity ratings, iconic strategies, and concreteness norms.","Iconicity, understood as a resemblance relationship between meaning and form, is an important variable that has important psycholinguistic effects in lexical processing and language learning across modalities of language. With the growing interest in iconicity, clear operationalizations in terms of the different ways in which iconicity is construed and measured are critical for establishing its broader psycholinguistic profile. This study reports a normed database of iconicity ratings for the same concepts in British Sign Language (BSL) and German Sign Language (DGS). As a related dimension, we also report the type of iconic mapping strategy, i.e., a nominal variable that reflects the different ways in which signs make form-meaning associations for each sign. Finally, we include concreteness ratings for the same concepts. Data from deaf and hearing signers show that iconicity ratings are strongly correlated across both languages, with different distributions across the different strategies, and skewed towards the iconic end of the scale for all groups except German hearing non-signers. Concreteness ratings in BSL and DGS are correlated, though more weakly, and skewed towards the concrete end of the scale. Interestingly, this differs from findings for spoken languages, where concreteness ratings exhibit substantially stronger correlations and abstract concepts are more predominantly represented. We also find that iconicity and concreteness ratings have a moderate positive and strong positive correlation in BSL and DGS, respectively.

37670858.0,Genome-wide survey and characterization of microsatellites in cashew and design of a web-based microsatellite database: CMDB.,"The cashew is an edible tree nut crop having a wide range of food and industrial applications. Despite great economic importance, the genome-wide characterization of microsatellites [simple sequence repeats (SSRs)] in cashew is lacking. In this study, we carried out the first comprehensive genome-wide microsatellites/SSRs characterization in cashew and developed polymorphic markers and a web-based microsatellite database. A total of 54526 SSRs were discovered in the cashew genome, with a mean frequency of 153 SSRs/Mb. Among the mined genome-wide SSRs (2-6 bp size motifs), the dinucleotide repeat motifs were dominant (68.98%) followed by the trinucleotides (24.56%). The Class I type of SSRs (≥20 bp) were 45.10%, while Class II repeat motifs (≥12-<20 bp) were 54.89% of the total genomic SSRs discovered here. Further, the AT-rich SSRs occurred more frequently in the cashew genome (84%) compared to the GC-rich SSRs. The validation of the <i>in silico</i>-mined genome-wide SSRs by PCR screening in cashew genotypes resulted in the development of 59 polymorphic SSR markers, and the polymorphism information content (PIC) of the polymorphic SSR markers ranged from 0.19 to 0.84. Further, a web-based database, ""Cashew Microsatellite Database (CMDB),"" was constructed to provide access to the genome-wide SSRs mined in this study as well as transcriptome-based SSRs from our previous study to the research community through a user-friendly searchable interface. Besides, CMDB provides information on experimentally validated SSRs. CMDB permits the retrieval of SSR markers information with the customized search options.

39444744.0,"Fish welfare in farms: potential, knowledge gaps and other insights from the fair-fish database.","An adequate understanding of fish behaviors and their interaction with farm-specific environments is pivotal for enhancing fish welfare in aquaculture. The fair-fish database aims to provide a consistent overview of the welfare of farmed fish. This platform consolidates ethological knowledge into profiles of farmed aquatic species. Its WelfareCheck profiles are organized around welfare indicators, with each criterion receiving classifications (no findings, unclear, low, medium, and high) regarding the likelihood and potential for individuals of a given species to experience good welfare in aquaculture systems, along with the associated certainty level. These criteria include home range, depth range, migration patterns, reproduction, aggregation patterns, aggressive behavior, substrate needs, stress responses, malformations, and slaughtering protocols. We investigated which of these 10 criteria are most relevant to the overall welfare of a species, considering the likelihood, potential, and certainty of good welfare in aquaculture. To achieve this, we reviewed and recorded the high classifications across each criterion and dimension from all published WelfareCheck profiles. To further investigate knowledge gaps across the criteria, we also recorded classifications marked as <i>unclear</i> and <i>no findings</i>. These were then compared across the criteria to assess the frequency of such classifications. While no significant differences were found between the criteria regarding the likelihood that the surveyed species meet their basic welfare needs, criteria related to reproduction, slaughter practices, and substrate needs demonstrated a high potential for better welfare outcomes. Moreover, reproduction and migration patterns exhibited high certainty in the available literature. Based on these findings, we conclude that improving the reproduction of farmed aquatic species, considering their natural needs and behavior, could be an effective and reliable approach to improving welfare. However, we also found a low certainty of information on aggression and an absence or conflicting data on home range, aggregation patterns, stress, and malformations. This highlights an urgent need for research in these areas, which are fundamental for developing more accurate assessments and recommendations for farmed aquatic species.",bio-resource,0.95515305,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39444744,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.37357974,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The effect of genetic ancestry on disparities in tumor genomics, risk factors, treatment, and outcomes of breast cancer is less understood. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a publicly available resource that has allowed for the recent emergence of genome analysis research seeking to characterize tumor DNA and protein expression by ancestry as well as the social construction of race and ethnicity. Results from TCGA based studies support previous clinical evidence that demonstrates that American women with African ancestry are more likely to be afflicted with breast cancers featuring aggressive biology and poorer outcomes compared with women with other backgrounds. Data from TCGA based studies suggest that Asian women have tumors with favorable immune microenvironments and may experience better disease-free survival compared with white Americans. TCGA contains limited data on Hispanic/Latinx patients due to small sample size. Overall, TCGA provides important opportunities to define the molecular, biologic, and germline genetic factors that contribute to breast cancer disparities.",bio-resource,0.8978173,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37587359,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.37339196,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Videos were previously recorded after ethical approval and written client consent forms, and involved cats with different types (eg, medical, surgical, trauma, orofacial) and degrees (eg, from no pain to severe pain) of acute pain, before and after surgery or the administration of analgesia. The database included videos of cats of different coat colours, ages, sex and breeds. Video selection was based on a published ethogram of acute pain behaviours in cats. Videos were selected by one observer (SM) according to their definition and quality, followed by a second round of screening by two observers (SM and PVS). Video editing included a standardised template (ie, watermark and titles).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 24 videos (mean length 33 ± 17 s) with each acute pain-related behaviour described in the ethogram were uploaded to an open-access online video-sharing platform (http://www.youtube.com/@Steagalllaboratory) with an individual hyperlink. Videos were provided with a short description of the behaviour for the public.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>This video-based compilation may promote better training of veterinary health professionals on acute pain assessment while improving feline health and welfare and the understanding of cat behaviours.",bio-resource,0.71752197,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39286948,1.0,has_url,False,False,True,0,0,0,0.3733708,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

We established a retrospective national cohort of 940 histologically defined patients (55.4% men, 44.6% women; median body mass index 31.3; 32% with type 2 diabetes) covering the complete MASLD severity spectrum, and created a secure, searchable, open resource (SteatoSITE). In 668 cases and 39 controls, we generated hepatic bulk RNA sequencing data and performed differential gene expression and pathway analysis, including exploration of gender-specific differences. A web-based gene browser was also developed. We integrated histopathological assessments, transcriptomic data and 5.67 million days of time-stamped longitudinal electronic health record data to define disease-stage-specific gene expression signatures, pathogenic hepatic cell subpopulations and master regulator networks associated with adverse outcomes in MASLD. We constructed a 15-gene transcriptional risk score to predict future hepatic decompensation events (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.86, 0.81 and 0.83 for 1-, 3- and 5-year risk, respectively). Additionally, thyroid hormone receptor beta regulon activity was identified as a critical suppressor of disease progression.

We aimed to create an open-access scoping repository of literature describing longer-term health outcomes after PICU admission, using a large multinational team (crowdsourcing) and a machine learning (ML) algorithm.<h4>Data sources</h4>We performed a registered scoping review (OSF DOI10.17605/OSF.IO/HE5VB; Registered November 21, 2022) using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases, 2000-2022, with no language restrictions.<h4>Study selection</h4>Observational or interventional studies describing outcomes of children (0-17 yr old) and their families or caregivers measured greater than 2 weeks post-PICU discharge. Titles and abstracts and full texts were initially screened by a large team of PICU healthcare workers and researchers who were recruited as part of an Evidence Hackathon event at the 2022 World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies conference. Initial screening results from 5000 citations were used to develop and validate an ML algorithm, after which a hybrid human crowdsourcing and ML approach was used to screen the remaining 11,055 studies.<h4>Data extraction</h4>Not applicable.<h4>Data synthesis</h4>Of 16,055 eligible citations, 1,301 met the criteria at full text for inclusion in the database. The screening was completed in just under 2 months while adhering to the gold standard systematic review methodology. Sensitivity for the hybrid human crowdsourcing and ML was 98%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A collaborative, global PICU team integrated with ML was successful in efficient and accurate large data synthesis, producing a scoping open-access database of studies reporting on post-PICU outcomes. The development of this repository has implications for future reviews, providing opportunities for networking and collaborative engagement in research.

36253599.0,Pain E-motion Faces Database (PEMF): Pain-related micro-clips for emotion research.,"A large number of publications have focused on the study of pain expressions. Despite the growing knowledge, the availability of pain-related face databases is still very scarce compared with other emotional facial expressions. The Pain E-Motion Faces Database (PEMF) is a new open-access database currently consisting of 272 micro-clips of 68 different identities. Each model displays one neutral expression and three pain-related facial expressions: posed, spontaneous-algometer and spontaneous-CO<sub>2</sub> laser. Normative ratings of pain intensity, valence and arousal were provided by students of three different European universities. Six independent coders carried out a coding process on the facial stimuli based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), in which ratings of intensity of pain, valence and arousal were computed for each type of facial expression. Gender and age effects of models across each type of micro-clip were also analysed. Additionally, participants' ability to discriminate the veracity of pain-related facial expressions (i.e., spontaneous vs posed) was explored. Finally, a series of ANOVAs were carried out to test the presence of other basic emotions and common facial action unit (AU) patterns. The main results revealed that posed facial expressions received higher ratings of pain intensity, more negative valence and higher arousal compared with spontaneous pain-related and neutral faces. No differential effects of model gender were found. Participants were unable to accurately discriminate whether a given pain-related face represented spontaneous or posed pain. PEMF thus constitutes a large open-source and reliable set of dynamic pain expressions useful for designing experimental studies focused on pain processes.",bio-resource,0.9975809,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36253599,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.37279335,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36944905.0,A network map of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) mediated signaling pathway in cancer.,"Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 (CKAP4) is a non-glycosylated type II transmembrane protein that serves as a cell surface-activated receptor. It is expressed primarily in the plasma membranes of bladder epithelial cells, type II alveolar pneumocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. CKAP4 is involved in various biological activities including cell proliferation, cell migration, keratinocyte differentiation, glycogenesis, fibrosis, thymic development, cardiogenesis, neuronal apoptosis, and cancer. CKAP4 has been described as a pro-tumor molecule that regulates the progression of various cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, oral cancer, bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, myeloma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and osteosarcoma. CKAP4 and its isoform bind to DKK1 or DKK3 (Dickkopf proteins) or antiproliferative factor (APF) and regulates several downstream signaling cascades. The CKAP4 complex plays a crucial role in regulating the signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT and MAPK1/3. Recently, CKAP4 has been recognized as a potential target for cancer therapy. Due to its biomedical importance, we integrated a network map of CKAP4. The available literature on CKAP4 signaling was manually curated according to the NetPath annotation criteria. The consolidated pathway map comprises 41 activation/inhibition events, 21 catalysis events, 35 molecular associations, 134 gene regulation events, 83 types of protein expression, and six protein translocation events.

To expand this resource, we crossed an active Mutator (Mu) stock with dent (B73, Co125) and flint (DK105, EP1, and F7) germplasm, resulting in the generation of 8064 mutagenized BonnMu F<sub>2</sub>-families. Sequencing of these Mu-tagged families revealed 425 924 presumptive heritable Mu insertions affecting 36 612 (83%) of the 44 303 high-confidence gene models of maize (B73v5). On average, we observed 12 Mu insertions per gene (425 924 total insertions/36 612 affected genes) and 53 insertions per BonnMu F<sub>2</sub>-family (425 924 total insertions/8064 families). Mu insertions and photos of seedling phenotypes from segregating BonnMu F<sub>2</sub>-families can be accessed through the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB). Downstream examination via the automated Mutant-seq Workflow Utility (MuWU) identified 94% of the presumptive germinal insertion sites in genic regions and only a small fraction of 6% inserting in non-coding intergenic sequences of the genome. Consistently, Mu insertions aligned with gene-dense chromosomal arms. In total, 42% of all BonnMu insertions were located in the 5' untranslated region of genes, corresponding to accessible chromatin. Furthermore, for 38% of the insertions (163 843 of 425 924 total insertions) Mu1, Mu8 and MuDR were confirmed to be the causal Mu elements.

To comprehensively explain the mechanisms underlying an organism's response to heat stress, it is essential to investigate and analyze genes that have been under-represented or less well-known in previous studies. In this study, we analyzed heat stress-responsive genes using a meta-analysis of numerous gene expression datasets from the public database. We obtained 322 human and 242 mouse pairs as the heat exposure and control data. The meta-analysis of these data identified 76 upregulated and 37 downregulated genes common to both humans and mice.

CircRNA identification is mostly an <i>in-silico</i> process, and the analysis of data from the BovReg project (https://www.bovreg.eu/) provided an opportunity to explore new ways to identify reliable circRNAs. By considering 117 tissue samples, we characterized 23,926 exonic circRNAs, 337 circRNAs from 273 introns (191 ciRNAs, 146 intron circles), 108 circRNAs from small non-coding genes and nearly 36.6K circRNAs classified as other_circRNAs. Furthermore, for 63 of those samples we analysed in parallel data from total-RNAseq (ribosomal RNAs depleted prior to library preparation) with paired mRNAseq (library prepared with poly(A)-selected RNAs). The high number of circRNAs detected in mRNAseq, and the significant number of novel circRNAs, mainly other_circRNAs, led us to consider all circRNAs detected in mRNAseq as artificial. This study provided evidence of 189 false entries in the list of exonic circRNAs: 103 artif_circRNAs identified by total RNAseq/mRNAseq comparison using two circRNA tools, 26 probable artif_circRNAs, and 65 identified by deep annotation analysis.

36508752.0,Review of the research databases on population-based Registries of Unified electronic Healthcare system of Kazakhstan (UNEHS): Possibilities and limitations for epidemiological research and Real-World Evidence.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>A 'learning healthcare system', based on electronic health records and other routinely collected healthcare data, would allow Real World Data (RWD) to be continuously fed into the system, ensuring that with every new patient treated, we know more overall about the practice of medicine. A judicious use of RWD would complement the traditional evidence from clinical research, for the benefit of all stakeholders involved in healthcare. Lack of data on disease epidemiology in Kazakhstan resonates with lower life expectancy and poorer health indicators compared to countries with analogous income per capita. Usage of primary data collection methods to fill these gaps require additional financial and human resources. Usage of big data, which is routinely collected though healthcare information systems, is considered as a competitive alternative in described circumstances.<h4>Objective</h4>Development of the Unified National Electronic Healthcare System (UNEHS) in Kazakhstan allowed the creation of research databases to investigate epidemiology of numerous diseases. UNEHS research databases endorse extensive research activities due to a prospective follow-up, coverage of the whole Kazakhstani population and relatively lower expenses to conduct epidemiological studies. This review paper aims to introduce the content and descriptive data on research databases on population-based registries of UNEHS and to discuss opportunities and limitations of its usage.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>UNEHS databases include medical data on 36.4% of an adult population of Kazakhstan. Research databases presented in this paper contain critical variables that can be utilized for investigation of disease epidemiology, effectiveness of provided medical procedures and infectious disease epidemiology. A few examples accompany a detailed elaboration on the possibilities of research database utilization in epidemiological research.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Considering numerous advantages, the UNEHS research databases are expected to greatly contribute to healthcare in Kazakhstan by providing critical data on disease epidemiology.

No disease-specific registry was identified for relapsing polychondritis, mixed connective tissue disease and undifferentiated connective tissue disease.<h4>Discussion</h4>This overview on the existing registries for rCTDs provides a useful starting point to identify the gaps and the strengths of registries on the coverage of rCTDs, and to develop a common data set and data collection approach for the establishment of the TogethERN ReCONNET Infrastructure.",bio-resource,0.87401134,1,0,0.5464,0,1,36226147,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.3651298,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38689078.0,Microplastic in Dredged Sediments: From Databases to Strategic Responses.,"Microplastics (MPs) accumulate in sediments, yet guidelines for evaluating MP risks in dredged sediments are lacking. The objective of this study was to review existing literature on MPs in sediments to improve fundamental knowledge of MP exposures and develop a publicly available database of MPs in sediments. Twelve percent of the reviewed papers (nine studies) included sediment core samples with MP concentrations generally decreasing with depth, peaking in the top 15 cm. The remaining papers evaluated surficial grab samples (0 to 15 cm depth) from various water bodies with MPs detected in almost every sample. Median MP concentrations (items/kg dry sediment) increased in this order: lakes and reservoirs (184), estuarine (263), Great Lakes nearshore areas and tributaries (290), riverine (410), nearshore marine areas (487), dredge activities (817), and harbors (948). Dredging of recurrent shoaling sediments could be expected to contain MPs at various depths with concentrations influenced by the time elapsed since the last dredging event. These results offer key insights into the presence and variability of MPs in dredged sediments, informing environmental monitoring and risk assessment strategies.",bio-resource,0.5971602,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38689078,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.3645026,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

These databases contain extensive information regarding maternal exposures, pregnancy complications, and neonatal care. They support quality improvement (QI) initiatives, facilitate clinical research, and track health outcomes in order to identify best practices and improve clinical guidelines. The Parkland Memorial Hospital NICU database was originally part of the Maternal and Neonatal Data Acquisition, Transmission and Evaluation project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to assess perinatal-neonatal care in Dallas County Texas, 1977-1982. Clinical data points were defined, transcribed and validated in 1977; revalidation has occurred multiple times.

They have had a profound impact nationally and internationally. The paternal and maternal genetic feature of the Qiang ethnic group has been revealed, leaving the question of the genetic characteristics from autosomes and X chromosome not answered. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of 36 A-STR (Microreader™ 36A ID System) and 19 X-STR (Microreader™ 19X System) for application in the Qiang population and to elucidate their genetic diversity in southwest China. The cumulative probability of exclusion (CPE) for autosomal STRs is 1-1.3814 × 10<sup>-15</sup> and the mean paternity exclusion chance (MEC) for X-STRs is 1-1.7323 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. Forensic parameters suggest that the STRs analyzed here are well-suited for forensic applications. The results of phylogenetic, interpopulation differentiation, and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) indicate that the Qiang people have extensive connections with ethnic minorities in China, supporting the view that the Qiang people are the oldest group in the entire Sino-Tibetan language family. The Qiang appeared genetically more associated with most ethnic groups in China, especially the Han. The calculation of random matching probability (RMP) was improved by F<sub>st</sub> correction of allele frequencies to make RMP more accurate and reasonable. This study can fill in the gaps in the Qiang STR reference database, providing valuable frequency data for forensic applications and evidence for the Qiang's genetic pattern as an important ancestral position in the Sino-Tibetan populations.",bio-resource,0.9876132,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38034634,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.36417082,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Large databases like the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and national NEN registries have provided significant epidemiological knowledge, but they have limitations given the recent advancements in NEN diagnostics and treatments. For instance, newer imaging techniques and therapies have revolutionized NEN management, rendering older data less representative. Additionally, crucial parameters, like the Ki67 index, are missing from many databases. Acknowledging these gaps, the Italian Association for Neuroendocrine Tumors (Itanet) initiated a national multicenter prospective database in 2019, aiming to gather data on newly-diagnosed gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (GEP) NENs. This observational study, coordinated by Itanet, includes patients from 37 Italian centers. The database, which is rigorously maintained and updated, focuses on diverse parameters including age, diagnostic techniques, tumor stage, treatments, and survival metrics. As of October 2023, data from 1,600 patients have been recorded, with an anticipation of reaching 3600 by the end of 2025. This study aims at understanding the epidemiology, clinical attributes, and treatment strategies for GEP-NENs in Italy, and to introduce the Itanet database project. Once comprehensive follow-up data will be acquired, the goal will be to discern predictors of treatment outcomes and disease prognosis. The Itanet database will offer an unparalleled, updated perspective on GEP-NENs, addressing the limitations of older databases and aiding in optimizing patient care.

The first <i>CTCF</i> variants in CRD cases were documented in 2013. To date, 76 <i>CTCF</i> variants have been further described in the literature. In recent years, due to the increased application of next-generation sequencing (NGS), growing numbers of <i>CTCF</i> variants are being identified, and multiple genotype-phenotype databases cataloging such variants are emerging.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we aimed to expand the genotypic spectrum of CRD, by cataloging NDD phenotypes associated with reported <i>CTCF</i> variants. Here, we systematically reviewed all known <i>CTCF</i> variants reported in case studies and large-scale exome sequencing cohorts. We also conducted a meta-analysis using public variant data from genotype-phenotype databases to identify additional <i>CTCF</i> variants, which we then curated and annotated.<h4>Results</h4>From this combined approach, we report an additional 86 <i>CTCF</i> variants associated with NDD phenotypes that have not yet been described in the literature. Furthermore, we describe and explain inconsistencies in the quality of reported variants, which impairs the reuse of data for research of NDDs and other pathologies.<h4>Discussion</h4>From this integrated analysis, we provide a comprehensive and annotated catalog of all currently known <i>CTCF</i> mutations associated with NDD phenotypes, to aid diagnostic applications, as well as translational and basic research.",bio-resource,0.99711776,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37324587,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.36379066,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

However, it remains elusive how the selection of 16S rRNA gene hypervariable regions and reference databases affects microbiota diversity and structure profiling. This study systematically evaluated the fitness of different frequently used reference databases (i.e. SILVA 138 SSU, GTDB bact120_r207, Greengenes 13_5 and MiDAS 4.8) and primers of 16S rRNA gene in microbiota profiling of anaerobic digestion and activated sludge collected from a full-scale swine wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The comparative results showed that MiDAS 4.8 achieved the highest levels of taxonomic diversity and species-level assignment rate. For whichever sample groups, microbiota richness captured by different primers decreased in the following order: V4 > V4-V5 > V3-V4 > V6-V8/V1-V3. Using primer-bias-free metagenomic data results as the judging standard, V4 region also best characterized microbiota structure and well represented typical functional guilds (e.g. methanogens, ammonium oxidizers and denitrifiers), while V6-V8 regions largely overestimated the archaeal methanogens (mainly <i>Methanosarcina</i>) by over 30 times. Therefore, MiDAS 4.8 database and V4 region are recommended for best simultaneous analysis of bacterial and archaeal community diversity and structure of the examined swine WWTP.",bio-resource,0.84156185,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37303742,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.36333472,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

We sought to (1) provide a curated list of genes that cause monogenic epilepsies, and (2) compare and contrast epilepsy gene panels from multiple sources.<h4>Methods</h4>We compared genes included on the epilepsy panels (as of July 29, 2022) of four clinical diagnostic providers: Invitae, GeneDx, Fulgent Genetics, and Blueprint Genetics; and two research resources: PanelApp Australia and ClinGen. A master list of all unique genes was supplemented by additional genes identified via PubMed searches up until August 15, 2022, using the search terms ""genetics"" AND/OR ""epilepsy"" AND/OR ""seizures"". Evidence supporting a monogenic role for all genes was manually reviewed; those with limited or disputed evidence were excluded. All genes were annotated according to inheritance pattern and broad epilepsy phenotype.<h4>Results</h4>The comparison of genes included on epilepsy clinical panels revealed high heterogeneity in both number of genes (range: 144-511) and content. Just 111 genes (15.5%) were included on all four clinical panels. Subsequent manual curation of all ""epilepsy genes"" identified >900 monogenic etiologies. Almost 90% of genes were associated with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. By comparison only 5% of genes were associated with monogenic causes of ""common epilepsies"" (i.e., generalized and focal epilepsy syndromes). Autosomal recessive genes were most frequent (56% of genes); however, this varied according to the associated epilepsy phenotype(s). Genes associated with common epilepsy syndromes were more likely to be dominantly inherited and associated with multiple epilepsy types.<h4>Significance</h4>Our curated list of monogenic epilepsy genes is publicly available: github.com/bahlolab/genes4epilepsy and will be regularly updated.

Environmental pressures and impacts related to the textile system include not only the use of resources (<i>e.g.</i>, water) but also the release of a wide variety of pollutants. This review's main objective is to highlight the presence of textile MCs and MPs in water, in their full path from textile factories (from raw materials to the final product) to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and finally to the receiving surface waters. Their environmental fate and ecotoxicity were also addressed. Overall, more than 500 compounds were found, many of which are so called ""contaminants of environmental concern"" such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and alkylphenol compounds. A database of physicochemical properties, ecotoxicity, and place of detection (specific textile process, WWTP, surface water or sediment) (classification by several international agencies) was compiled for the chemical detected. Preliminary risk assessment was conducted for those MCs for which the reported environmental concentrations exceeded the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC). These chemicals were some nonylphenols, nonylphenol ethoxylates and organophosphate esters. Among MPs, polyester and nylon fibres were the most abundant. The highest concentration of MPs was reported in sludge (about 1.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> MPs per kg) compared to wastewater and surface water which showed MP concentrations at least two orders of magnitude lower.

Medical education, situated between medicine and education, has no dedicated database of its own. Many medical education researchers use MEC, some use ERIC and some do not.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a descriptive analysis using search strategies to retrieve medical education references from MEC and ERIC. ERIC references which were duplicates with MEC references were removed. Unique ERIC references were tallied.<h4>Results</h4>Between 1977 and 2022, MEC has 359,354 unique references relevant to medical education.

This innate-like T cell subset predominantly express CD8 in humans. Unlike conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which recognize peptide antigen presented by polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, MAIT cells are restricted by MR1, a non-polymorphic antigen-presenting molecule widely expressed in multiple tissues. Thus, identification of proteomic signature of MAIT cells in relation to conventional T cells is pivotal in understanding it's specific functional characteristics. The high-resolution dataset presents here comprehensively describes and compare the whole cell proteomes of MAIT (TCRVα7.2<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>+</sup>) and conventional/non-MAIT T cells (TCR Vα7.2<sup>-</sup>CD161<sup>-</sup>) in humans. The dataset was generated using the proteomic samples prepared from matched T cell subsets sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of three healthy volunteers. Peptides obtained from trypsin-digested cell lysates were analysed using Data-Dependent Mass Spectrometry (DDA-MS). Label-free quantitation of DDA-MS data using MaxQuant and MaxLFQ software identified 4,442 proteins at a 1 % false discovery rate. Of them, 3680 proteins that were detected with single UniProt accession and a minimum of 2 unique or razor peptides were assessed to identify differentially abundant proteins between MAIT cells and conventional T cells, including total T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The dataset comprises high-quality label-free quantitative proteomic data that can be used to compare the expression pattern of whole cell proteomes between the above-mentioned T cell populations. Further, this can be used as a reference proteome of human MAIT cells for the in-depth understanding of the MAIT cell behaviour among T cells and to discover potential therapeutic targets to modulate MAIT cell function.",bio-resource,0.80630976,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39224509,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.35918662,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

39693144.0,A large-scale proteomics resource of circulating extracellular vesicles for biomarker discovery in pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis of all common tumors. Earlier cancer diagnosis could increase survival rates and better assessment of metastatic disease could improve patient care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to diagnose this deadly malignancy. Analyzing circulating extracellular vesicles (cEVs) using 'liquid biopsies' offers an attractive approach to diagnose and monitor disease status. However, it is important to differentiate EV-associated proteins enriched in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from those with benign pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). To meet this need, we combined the novel EVtrap method for highly efficient isolation of EVs from plasma and conducted proteomics analysis of samples from 124 individuals, including patients with PDAC, benign pancreatic diseases and controls. On average, 912 EV proteins were identified per 100 µL of plasma. EVs containing high levels of PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, and RUVBL2 were associated with PDAC compared to the benign diseases in both discovery and validation cohorts. EVs with PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR were associated with metastasis, and those with CRP, RALB, and CD55 correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Finally, we validated a seven EV protein PDAC signature against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC. To our knowledge, our study represents the largest proteomics profiling of circulating EVs ever conducted in pancreatic cancer and provides a valuable open-source atlas to the scientific community with a comprehensive catalogue of novel cEVs that may assist in the development of biomarkers and improve the outcomes of patients with PDAC.",bio-resource,0.98365617,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39693144,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.3569289,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Nevertheless, to our knowledge, a compendium of all the genes that have been associated with CD is lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted functional analyses of a gene set generated from a systematic review where genes potentially related to CD found in the literature were analyzed and classified depending on the genetic evidence reported and putative biological function. For this, we retrieved and analyzed 2496 abstracts comprising 1067 human genes plus 22 publications regarding 133 genes from GWAS Catalog. Then, each gene was curated and categorized according to the type of evidence associated with Crohn's disease.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 126 genes associated with Crohn's disease risk by specific experiments. Additionally, 71 genes were recognized associated through GWAS alone, 18 to treatment response, 41 to disease complications, and 81 to related diseases. Bioinformatic analysis of the 126 genes supports their importance in Crohn's disease and highlights genes associated with specific aspects such as symptoms, drugs, and comorbidities. Importantly, most genes were not included in commercial genetic panels suggesting that Crohn's disease is genetically underdiagnosed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We identified a total of 126 genes from PubMed and 71 from GWAS that showed evidence of association to diagnosis, 18 to treatment response, and 41 to disease complications in Crohn's disease.

37213253.0,Characterization of cell-type specific circular RNAs associated with colorectal cancer metastasis.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy and a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. More than half of CRC patients develop metastatic disease (mCRC) with an average 5-year survival rate of 13%. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently emerged as important tumorigenesis regulators; however, their role in mCRC progression remains poorly characterized. Further, little is known about their cell-type specificity to elucidate their functions in the tumor microenvironment (TME). To address this, we performed total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 30 matched normal, primary and metastatic samples from 14 mCRC patients. Additionally, five CRC cell lines were sequenced to construct a circRNA catalog in CRC. We detected 47 869 circRNAs, with 51% previously unannotated in CRC and 14% novel candidates when compared to existing circRNA databases. We identified 362 circRNAs differentially expressed in primary and/or metastatic tissues, termed circular RNAs associated with metastasis (CRAMS). We performed cell-type deconvolution using published single-cell RNA-seq datasets and applied a non-negative least squares statistical model to estimate cell-type specific circRNA expression. This predicted 667 circRNAs as exclusively expressed in a single cell type.

The trancriptome from infected wheat grains of the susceptible wheat cultivar WL711 at 24 h, 48h, and 7d after inoculation of PSWKBGH-1, 2 and PSWKBGD-3 were also isolated. Further, two transcriptome analyses were performed utilizing T. indica transcriptome to extract dikaryon genes responsible for pathogenesis, and wheat transcriptome to extract wheat genes affected by dikaryon involved in plant-pathogen interaction during progression of KB in wheat. A total of 54, 529, and 87 genes at 24hai, 48hai, and 7dai, respectively were upregulated in dikaryon stage while 21, 35, and 134 genes of T. indica at 24hai, 48hai, and 7dai, respectively, were activated only in dikaryon stage. While, a total of 23, 17, and 52 wheat genes at 24hai, 48hai, and 7dai, respectively were upregulated due to the presence of dikaryon stage only. The results obtained during this study have been compiled in a web resource called TiGeR ( http://backlin.cabgrid.res.in/tiger/ ), which is the first genomic resource for T. indica cataloguing genes, genomic and polymorphic SSRs of the three T. indica lines, wheat and T. indica DEGs as well as wheat genes affected by T. indica dikaryon along with the pathogenecity related proteins of T. indica dikaryon during incidence of KB at different time points.

To evaluate this omics approach, we first built a database of bacterial lipids for representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Our lipidomics analysis of the reference bacteria involved high-resolution mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization with less than a 1.0 ppm mass error. The lipidomics profiles of bacterial cultures clearly distinguished between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In the case of bovine paratuberculosis (PTB) serum, we monitored two unique bacterial lipids that we also monitored in <i>Mycobacterium avian</i> subspecies <i>PTB</i>. These were PDIM-B C82, a phthiodiolone dimycocerosate, and the trehalose monomycolate hTMM 28:1, constituents of the bacterial cell envelope in mycolic-containing bacteria. The next step will be to determine if lipidomics can detect subclinical PTB infections which can last 2-to-4 years in bovine PTB.

Since the 1950s, this region has been affected by uncontrolled urban sprawl, resulting in a change in the ecological habits of some vector mosquitoes. Over the last two decades, cases of autochthonous bromeliad malaria associated with the presence of anopheline mosquitoes in the EPA have been recorded. <i>Anopheles cruzii,</i> the primary vector of plasmodia in the region, is abundant and found naturally infected with both <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> and <i>Plasmodium malariae.</i> In light of this, the present study sought to update the catalog of mosquito fauna in this EPA, analyze mosquito diversity among sites with different degrees of conservation and compare species using different collection techniques. Field collections were carried out from March, 2015 to April, 2017. A total of 20,755 specimens were collected, distributed in 106 different taxa representing 16 genera. Analysis of the diversity among the sites based on the Shannon and Simpson indices showed that the most preserved of them had the lowest indices because of the dominance of <i>An. cruzii</i>. The results highlight the increase in the number of different taxa collected as different mosquito collection techniques were included, confirming the importance of using several strategies to ensure adequate sampling of a local mosquito fauna when exploring a greater number of ecotopes. Furthermore, the survey produced the most recent and complete list of mosquito species in the Capivari-Monos EPA, a refuge and shelter for native and introduced mosquito species where new biocenoses, including pathogens, vertebrate hosts, and vectors can form, allowing zoonotic outbreaks in the local human population to occur.",bio-resource,0.87055576,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39315961,0.5,impl_kw=1,False,False,False,1,0,0,0.35474235,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

39709002.0,Catalogue of inherited autosomal recessive disorders found amongst the Roma population of Europe.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Roma population are an endogamous, genetically isolated, minority population who migrated from North-Western India to Europe from the 10th Century throughout the Byzantine period and continues to the present day. Approximately 10-12 million Romani people reside in segregated settlements in Europe, and smaller populations live in North America and China. In addition to the endogamy, they also practice consanguinity. This has resulted in a higher frequency of rare autosomal recessive disorders some of which are unique to the Roma population. Some disorders result from founder variants whilst others are private variants, occurring within one nuclear family. Most are found as homozygous variants but compound heterozygosity is seen in a number of conditions.<h4>Objective</h4>Clinicians and scientists with experience in managing and diagnosing rare diseases in this population in Ireland, Romania and Greece have developed a comprehensive catalogue of autosomal recessive inherited disorders found in the Roma population. Our aim is that this catalogue will aid rapid diagnosis and highlight the differential diagnoses to consider in challenging cases.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a detailed literature search to identify relevant publications and disease variants described in patients whose ethnicity was described as Roma. In addition, we interrogated data from local clinicians and colleagues in Ireland and Romania to collect additional unpublished variants which have yet to be reported in the medical literature. Where possible, we have mapped these disorders back to their European country of origin. Furthermore, we searched the variants allele frequencies on ClinVar. We analysed exome data from New Delhi, India to trace any of these founder variants back their origins.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 90 distinct autosomal recessive disorders, manifesting as 91 distinct phenotypes and 111 pathogenic disease variants. These include both published (n = 91) and unpublished (n = 20) findings identified in the Roma population in Europe. The Indian exome data revealed that only 12/111 variants were identified.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We have assembled a catalogue of inherited autosomal recessive disorders and 111 pathogenic variants found in the Roma population.

These TF-GR lines each express one of 1255 TFs as a fusion with the GR gene. An average 14 lines of T<sub>2</sub> transgenic TF-GR lines were generated for each TF to monitor their function. To evaluate these transcription lines, we induced the TF-GR lines of phytochrome-interacting factor 4, which controls photomorphogenesis, with synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. These phytochrome-interacting factor 4-GR lines showed the phenotype described in a previous report. We performed screening of the other TF-GR lines for TFs involved in light signaling under blue and far-red light conditions and identified 13 novel TF candidates. Among these, we found two lines showing higher anthocyanin accumulation under light conditions and we examined the regulating genes.

Recognizing these challenges, the Veterans Affairs (VA) National Radiation Oncology Program (NROP) is developing Granular Radiotherapy Information Database (GRID), a platform and pipeline to combine radiotherapy data across the VA with the goal of both better understanding treatment patterns and outcomes and enhancing research and data analysis capabilities.<h4>Methods</h4>This study represents a proof-of-principle retrospective cohort analysis and review of select radiation treatment data from the VA Radiation Oncology Quality Surveillance Program (VAROQS) initiative. Key radiation oncology data elements were extracted from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine Radiotherapy extension (DICOM-RT) files and combined into a single database using custom scripts. These data were transferred to the VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) for integration and comparison with the VA Cancer Registry System and tumor sequencing data.<h4>Results</h4>The final cohort includes 1,568 patients, 766 of whom have corresponding DICOM-RT data. All cases were successfully linked to the CDW; 18.8% of VAROQS cases were not reported in the existing VA cancer registry. The VAROQS data contributed accurate radiation treatment details that were often erroneous or missing from the cancer registry record. Tumor sequencing data were available for approximately 5% of VAROQS cases. Finally, we describe a clinical dosimetric analysis leveraging GRID.<h4>Conclusion</h4>NROP's GRID initiative aims to integrate VA radiotherapy data with other clinical data sets.

Though several genes and miRNA modules influencing GS are known and seed development transcriptomes analyzed, a comprehensive compendium connecting all possible players is lacking. This study utilizes two contrasting GS indica rice genotypes (small-grained SN and large-grained LGR). Rice seed development involves five stages (S1-S5). Comparative transcriptome and miRNome atlases, substantiated with morphological and cytological studies, from S1-S5 stages and flag leaf have been analyzed to identify GS proponents.<h4>Results</h4>Histology shows prolonged endosperm development and cell enlargement in LGR. Stand-alone and comparative RNAseq analyses manifest S3 (5-10 days after pollination) stage as crucial for GS enhancement, coherently with cell cycle, endoreduplication, and programmed cell death participating genes. Seed storage protein and carbohydrate accumulation, cytologically and by RNAseq, is shown to be delayed in LGR. Fourteen transcription factor families influence GS. Pathway genes for four phytohormones display opposite patterns of higher expression. A total of 186 genes generated from the transcriptome analyses are located within GS trait-related QTLs deciphered by a cross between SN and LGR. Fourteen miRNA families express specifically in SN or LGR seeds. Eight miRNA-target modules display contrasting expressions amongst SN and LGR, while 26 (SN) and 43 (LGR) modules are differentially expressed in all stages.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Integration of all analyses concludes in a ""Domino effect"" model for GS regulation highlighting chronology and fruition of each event.

35789547.0,Identification and functional analysis of N6-methyladenine (m<sup>6</sup> A)-related lncRNA across 33 cancer types.,"<h4>Background</h4>N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup> A) plays an essential role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are discovered to be important targets of m<sup>6</sup> A modification, and they play fundamental roles in diverse biological processes. However, there is still a lack of knowledge with regards to the association between m<sup>6</sup> A and lncRNAs in human tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>The relationship between lncRNAs and 21 m<sup>6</sup> A regulators was comprehensively explored, through the integration of multi-omics data from M6A2Target, m6A-Atlas, and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). In order to explore the potential roles of m6A-related lncRNAs in human tumors, three applicable methods were introduced, which include the construction of ceRNA networks, drug sensitivity estimation, and survival analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A substantial number of positive correlation events across 33 cancer types were found. Moreover, cancer-specific lncRNAs were associated with tissue specificity, and cancer-common lncRNAs were conserved in cancer-related biological function. In particular, the m<sup>6</sup> A-related lncRNA FGD5-AS1 was found to be associated with cancer treatment, through its influence on cisplatin resistance in breast cancer patients. Finally, a user-friendly interface Lnc2m6A, which is enriched with various browsing sections resource for the exhibition of relationships and putative biogenesis between lncRNAs and m<sup>6</sup> A modifications, is offered in http://hainmu-biobigdata.com/Lnc2m6A.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, the results from this paper will provide a valuable resource that guides both mechanistic and therapeutic roles of m<sup>6</sup> A-related lncRNAs in human tumors.",bio-resource,0.8248101,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35789547,1.0,has_url,False,False,True,0,0,0,0.3480719,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37969094.0,"German longitudinal prescription database (LRx): Description of characteristics, use in pharmacoepidemiological research, and limitations .","Large databases have played a critical role in pharmacoepidemiological research in the last decade, with this role likely to gain further importance in the future. The aim of the present paper is to describe the characteristics, the recent use, and the limitations of the German longitudinal prescription (LRx) database. The LRx database contains patient-level data on prescriptions collected in retail pharmacies, corresponding to ~ 80% of prescriptions reimbursed by statutory health insurance funds in Germany. The LRx database includes a higher proportion of older adults and women compared to the overall German population with statutory health insurance. Coverage per family of drugs ranges from 71.8% for antiepileptics to 94.7% for urological agents. Multiple pharmacoepidemiological studies based on the data from the German LRx database have been published in the last years on topics such as patterns of prescription and treatment adherence and persistence. A large number of disorders have been investigated in this research (e.g., type 2 diabetes, inflammatory diseases, and psychiatric conditions). The major limitations of the LRx database are the lack of formal diagnoses and the absence of hospital data. In conclusion, the German LRx database could be a key source of data for future pharmacoepidemiological studies.",bio-resource,0.9748752,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37969094,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.34624732,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38059438.0,Clinical variants paired with phenotype: A rich resource for brain gene curation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Clinically ascertained variants are under-utilized in neurodevelopmental disorder research. We established the Brain Gene Registry (BGR) to coregister clinically identified variants in putative brain genes with participant phenotypes. Here, we report 179 genetic variants in the first 179 BGR registrants and analyze the proportion that were novel to ClinVar at the time of entry and those that were absent in other disease databases.<h4>Methods</h4>From 10 academically affiliated institutions, 179 individuals with 179 variants were enrolled into the BGR. Variants were cross-referenced for previous presence in ClinVar and for presence in 6 other genetic databases.<h4>Results</h4>Of 179 variants in 76 genes, 76 (42.5%) were novel to ClinVar, and 62 (34.6%) were absent from all databases analyzed. Of the 103 variants present in ClinVar, 37 (35.9%) were uncertain (ClinVar aggregate classification of variant of uncertain significance or conflicting classifications). For 5 variants, the aggregate ClinVar classification was inconsistent with the interpretation from the BGR site-provided classification.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A significant proportion of clinical variants that are novel or uncertain are not shared, limiting the evidence base for new gene-disease relationships. Registration of paired clinical genetic test results with phenotype has the potential to advance knowledge of the relationships between genes and neurodevelopmental disorders.",bio-resource,0.8307094,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38059438,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.34612292,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Individualised per-laboratory algorithms were designed and applied in NDRS to extract and map the data to the common data model. Laboratory-level MMR activity audit data from the Clinical Molecular Genetics Society/Association of Clinical Genomic Science were used to assess early years' missing data.<h4>Results</h4>Individual-level data from patients undergoing NHS MMR germline genetic testing were submitted from all 13 English laboratories performing MMR analyses, comprising in total 16 722 patients (9649 full-gene, 7073 targeted), with the earliest submission from 2000. The NDRS dataset is estimated to comprise >60% of NHS MMR analyses performed since inception of NHS MMR analysis, with complete national data for full-gene analyses for 2016 onwards. Out of 9649 full-gene tests, 2724 had an abnormal result, approximately 70% of which were (likely) pathogenic. Data linkage to the National Cancer Registry demonstrated colorectal cancer was the most frequent cancer type in which full-gene analysis was performed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The NDRS MMR dataset is a unique national pan-laboratory amalgamation of individual-level clinical and genomic patient data with pseudonymised identifiers enabling linkage to other national datasets.

Here we analyze the tropism of 10 naturally occurring AAV serotypes (AAV3B, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAVrh8, AAVrh10, and AAVrh74) following systemic delivery into male and female mice. A transgene-expressing ZsGreen and Cre recombinase was used to identify transduction in a cell-dependent manner based on fluorescence. Cre-driven activation of tdTomato fluorescence offered superior sensitivity for transduced cells. All serotypes except AAV3B and AAV4 had high liver tropism. Fluorescence activation revealed transduction of unexpected tissues, including adrenals, testes, and ovaries. Rare transduced cells within tissues were also readily visualized. Biodistribution of AAV genomes correlated with fluorescence, except in immune tissues. AAV4 was found to have a pan-endothelial tropism while also targeting pancreatic beta cells.

In this study, we screened differentially expressed genes in type 2 diabetes through the GEO database and sought to identify the key virulence factors for type 2 diabetes through a transcription factor regulatory network. Our findings may help identify new therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes. Data pertaining to the humoral (whole blood) gene expression profile of diabetic patients were obtained from the NCBI's GEO Datasets database and gene sets with differential expression were identified. Subsequently, the TRED transcriptional regulatory element database was integrated to build a gene regulatory network for type 2 diabetes. Functional analysis (GO-Analysis) and Pathway-analysis of differentially expressed genes were performed using the DAVID database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Finally, gene-disease correlation analysis was performed using the DAVID online annotation tool. A total of 236 pathogenic genes, four transcription factors related to the pathogenic genes, and 261 corresponding target genes were identified.

Sequencing data were processed using Cell Ranger, and clustering and gene expression analysis was performed using Seurat. Cell types were annotated through expression profiling of single cells using known markers and data from other single-cell studies.<h4>Results</h4>Fourteen unique cell types were identified, including serous, goblet, club, basal, ciliated, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells, as well as multiple types of blood cells.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This catalog provides a comprehensive depiction of the cellular composition of middle turbinate mucosa. By uncovering the cellular stratification of gene expression profiles in the healthy middle turbinate epithelium, the groundwork has been laid for further investigation into the molecular pathogenesis and targeted therapy of sinonasal disease.",bio-resource,0.97910404,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38093720,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.3447091,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38682751.0,Genetic counseling for the dystrophinopathies-Practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.,"The dystrophinopathies encompass the phenotypically variable forms of muscular dystrophy caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene. The dystrophinopathies include the most common inherited muscular dystrophy among 46,XY individuals, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as Becker muscular dystrophy and other less common phenotypic variants. With increased access to and utilization of genetic testing in the diagnostic and carrier setting, genetic counselors and clinicians in diverse specialty areas may care for individuals with and carriers of dystrophinopathy. This practice resource was developed as a tool for genetic counselors and other health care professionals to support counseling regarding dystrophinopathies, including diagnosis, health risks and management, psychosocial needs, reproductive options, clinical trials, and treatment. Genetic testing efforts have enabled genotype/phenotype correlation in the dystrophinopathies, but have also revealed unexpected findings, further complicating genetic counseling for this group of conditions. Additionally, the therapeutic landscape for dystrophinopathies has dramatically changed with several FDA-approved therapeutics, an expansive research pathway, and numerous clinical trials. Genotype-phenotype correlations are especially complex and genetic counselors' unique skill sets are useful in exploring and explaining this to families.

36941001.0,A new function in the Stabilis database: physical compatibility and incompatibility of injectable drugs to secure Y-site administration.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>In intensive care units, the mixing of injectable drugs via Y-site administration is often necessary. However, some mixtures can lead to physical incompatibility or chemical instability. To assist healthcare professionals, several databases such as Stabilis compile compatibility and stability data. The objectives of this study were to update the online database Stabilis by adding physical compatibility data to the website and to characterise the incompatibility data already present in the database by specifying the phenomenon at the origin of the incompatibility and its time of occurrence.<h4>Methods</h4>Bibliographic sources referenced in Stabilis were evaluated using several criteria. After the evaluation, studies were rejected or the data they contain were added to the database. Data entries contained the following information: name of the two injectable drugs involved in the mixture and their concentration if available, the dilution solvent and the phenomenon at the origin of the incompatibility and its time of occurrence for incompatibility data. Three functions of the website were modified, including the 'Y-site compatibility table' function, which allows creation of customised compatibility tables.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1184 bibliographic sources were evaluated, 77.3% (n=915) of which were scientific articles, 20.5% (n=243) were Summaries of Product Characteristics and 2.2% (n=26) were communications in a pharmaceutical congress. After evaluation, 28.9% (n=342) of the sources were rejected. From the 71.1% (n=842) sources selected, 8073 (70.2%) compatibility data entries and 3433 incompatibility data entries (29.8%) were made. With the addition of these data, the database contained compatibility and incompatibility data for 431 injectable drugs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Since the update, the 'Y-site compatibility table' function has seen its traffic increased by about 66% (∼1500 tables per month compared with ∼2500 tables per month).

38497118.0,A first complete catalog of highly expressed genes in eight chicken tissues reveals uncharacterized gene families specific for the chicken testis.,"Based on next-generation sequencing, we established a repertoire of differentially overexpressed genes (DoEGs) in eight adult chicken tissues: the testis, brain, lung, liver, kidney, muscle, heart, and intestine. With 4,499 DoEGs, the testis had the highest number and proportion of DoEGs compared with the seven somatic tissues. The testis DoEG set included the highest proportion of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs; 1,851, representing 32% of the lncRNA genes in the whole genome) and the highest proportion of protein-coding genes (2,648, representing 14.7% of the protein-coding genes in the whole genome). The main significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms related to the protein-coding genes were ""reproductive process,"" ""tubulin binding,"" and ""microtubule cytoskeleton."" Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we confirmed the overexpression of genes that encode proteins already described in chicken sperm [such as calcium binding tyrosine phosphorylation regulated (<i>CABYR</i>), spermatogenesis associated 18 (<i>SPATA18</i>), and CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein (<i>CDK5RAP2</i>)] but whose testis origin had not been previously confirmed. Moreover, we demonstrated the overexpression of vertebrate orthologs of testis genes not yet described in the adult chicken testis [such as NIMA related kinase 2 (<i>NEK2</i>), adenylate kinase 7 (<i>AK7</i>), and <i>CCNE2</i>]. Using clustering according to primary sequence homology, we found that 1,737 of the 2,648 (67%) testis protein-coding genes were unique genes. This proportion was significantly higher than the somatic tissues except muscle. We clustered the other 911 testis protein-coding genes into 495 families, from which 47 had all paralogs overexpressed in the testis. Among these 47 testis-specific families, eight contained uncharacterized duplicated paralogs without orthologs in other metazoans except birds: these families are thus specific for chickens/birds.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Comparative next-generation sequencing analysis of eight chicken tissues showed that the testis has highest proportion of long noncoding RNA and protein-coding genes of the whole genome. We identified new genes in the chicken testis, including orthologs of known mammalian testicular genes. We also identified 47 gene families in which all the members were overexpressed, if not exclusive, in the testis. Eight families, organized in duplication clusters, were unknown, without orthologs in metazoans except birds, and are thus specific for chickens/birds.",bio-resource,0.90998054,1,1,0.6813,1,1,38497118,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.34264928,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38356732.0,The comprehensive English National Lynch Syndrome Registry: development and description of a new genomics data resource.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lynch Syndrome (LS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by constitutional pathogenic variants in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. To date, fragmentation of clinical and genomic data has restricted understanding of national LS ascertainment and outcomes, and precluded evaluation of NICE guidance on testing and management. To address this, via collaboration between researchers, the National Disease Registration Service (NDRS), NHS Genomic Medicine Service Alliances (GMSAs), and NHS Regional Clinical Genetics Services, a comprehensive registry of LS carriers in England has been established.<h4>Methods</h4>For comprehensive ascertainment of retrospectively identified MMR pathogenic variant (PV) carriers (diagnosed prior to January 1, 2023), information was retrieved from all clinical genetics services across England, then restructured, amalgamated, and validated via a team of trained experts in NDRS. An online submission portal was established for prospective ascertainment from January 1, 2023. The resulting data, stored in a secure database in NDRS, were used to investigate the demographic and genetic characteristics of the cohort, censored at July 25, 2023. Cancer outcomes were investigated via linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset (NCRD).<h4>Findings</h4>A total of 11,722 retrospective and 570 prospective data submissions were received, resulting in a comprehensive English National Lynch Syndrome Registry (ENLSR) comprising 9030 unique individuals. The most frequently identified pathogenic MMR genes were <i>MSH2</i> and <i>MLH1</i> at 37.2% (n = 3362) and 29.1% (n = 2624), respectively. 35.9% (n = 3239) of the ENLSR cohort received their LS diagnosis before their first cancer diagnosis (presumptive predictive germline test). Of these, 6.3% (n = 204) developed colorectal cancer, at a median age of initial diagnosis of 51 (IQR 40-62), compared to 73 years (IQR 64-80) in the general population (p < 0.0001).<h4>Interpretation</h4>The ENLSR represents the first comprehensive national registry of PV carriers in England and one of the largest cohorts of MMR PV carriers worldwide. The establishment of a secure, centralised infrastructure and mechanism for routine registration of newly identified carriers ensures sustainability of the data resource.<h4>Funding</h4>This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK and Bowel Cancer UK. The funder of this study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.",bio-resource,0.9755868,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38356732,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.3418008,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35594146.0,Suspect Screening of Liquid Crystal Monomers (LCMs) in Sediment Using an Established Database Covering 1173 LCMs.,"Recent studies have suggested that liquid crystal monomers (LCMs) are emerging contaminants in the environment, and knowledge of this class of substances is very rare. Here, we reviewed existing LCM-related documents, i.e., publications and patents, and established a database involving 1173 LCMs. These 1173 LCMs were further calculated for their physicochemical properties, i.e., persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B), long-range transport potential (LRTP), and Arctic contamination and bioaccumulation potential (ACBAP). We found that 476 out of them were P&B chemicals (99% of them were halogenated), and 320 of them could have ACBAP properties (67% of them were halogenated). This LCM database was further applied for suspect screening of LCMs in <i>n</i> = 33 sediment samples by use of gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF/MS). We tentatively identified 26 LCM formulas, which could have 43 chemical structures. Two out of these 43 suspect LCM candidates, 1-butoxy-2,3-difluoro-4-(4-propylcyclohexyl) benzene (3cH4OdFP) and 1-ethoxy-2,3-difluoro-4-(4-pentyl cyclohexyl) benzene (5cH2OdFP), were fully confirmed by a comparison of unique GC and MS characteristics with their authentic standards. Overall, our present study expanded the previous LCM database from 362 to 1173, and 1173 LCMs in this database were calculated for their physicochemical properties. Meanwhile, taking <i>n</i> = 33 sediment samples as an exercise, we successfully developed a suspect screening strategy tailored for LCMs, and this strategy could have promising potential to be extended to other environmental matrices.",bio-resource,0.9851362,1,1,0.6189,1,1,35594146,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.34154013,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35459677.0,Developing a medication adherence technologies repository: proposed structure and protocol for an online real-time Delphi study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>An online interactive repository of available medication adherence technologies may facilitate their selection and adoption by different stakeholders. Developing a repository is among the main objectives of the European Network to Advance Best practices and technoLogy on medication adherencE (ENABLE) COST Action (CA19132). However, meeting the needs of diverse stakeholders requires careful consideration of the repository structure.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>A real-time online Delphi study by stakeholders from 39 countries with research, practice, policy, patient representation and technology development backgrounds will be conducted. Eleven ENABLE members from 9 European countries formed an interdisciplinary steering committee to develop the repository structure, prepare study protocol and perform it. Definitions of medication adherence technologies and their attributes were developed iteratively through literature review, discussions within the steering committee and ENABLE Action members, following ontology development recommendations. Three domains (<i>product and provider information (D1), medication adherence descriptors (D2)</i> and <i>evaluation and implementation (D3</i>)) branching in 13 attribute groups are proposed: <i>product and provider information, target use scenarios, target health conditions, medication regimen, medication adherence management components, monitoring/measurement methods and targets, intervention modes of delivery, target behaviour determinants, behaviour change techniques, intervention providers, intervention settings, quality indicators and implementation indicators</i>. Stakeholders will evaluate the proposed definition and attributes' relevance, clarity and completeness and have multiple opportunities to reconsider their evaluations based on aggregated feedback in real-time. Data collection will stop when the predetermined response rate will be achieved. We will quantify agreement and perform analyses of process indicators on the whole sample and per stakeholder group.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethical approval for the COST ENABLE activities was granted by the Malaga Regional Research Ethics Committee.

39860951.0,Normative Database of Spatiotemporal Gait Metrics Across Age Groups: An Observational Case-Control Study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Gait analysis is a vital tool in the assessment of human movement and has been widely used in clinical settings to identify potential abnormalities in individuals. However, there is a lack of consensus on the normative values for gait metrics in large populations. The primary objective of this study is to establish a normative database of spatiotemporal gait metrics across various age groups, contributing to a broader understanding of human gait dynamics. By doing so, we aim to enhance the clinical utility of gait analysis in diagnosing and managing health conditions.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted an observational case-control study involving 313 healthy participants. The MetaMotionC IMU by Mbientlab Inc., equipped with a triaxial accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, was used to capture gait data. The IMU was placed at the sternal angle of each participant to ensure optimal data capture during a 50 m walk along a flat, unobstructed pathway. Data were collected through a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone running a custom-developed application and subsequently analysed using IMUGaitPY, a specialised version of the GaitPY Python package.<h4>Results</h4>The data showed that gait speeds decrease with ageing for males and females. The fastest gait speed is observed in the 41-50 age group at 1.35 ± 0.23 m/s. Males consistently exhibit faster gait speeds than females across all age groups. Step length and cadence do not have clear trends with ageing. Gait speed and step length increase consistently with height, with the tallest group (191-200 cm) walking at an average speed of 1.49 ± 0.12 m/s, with an average step length of 0.91 ± 0.05 m. Cadence, however, decreases with increasing height, with the tallest group taking 103.52 ± 5.04 steps/min on average.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study has established a comprehensive normative database for the spatiotemporal gait metrics of gait speed, step length, and cadence, highlighting the complexities of gait dynamics across age and sex groups and the influence of height. Our findings offer valuable reference points for clinicians to distinguish between healthy and pathological gait patterns, facilitating early detection and intervention for gait-related disorders. Moreover, this database enhances the clinical utility of gait analysis, supporting more objective diagnoses and assessments of therapeutic interventions. The normative database provides a valuable reference future research and clinical practice. It enables a more nuanced understanding of how gait evolves with age, gender, and physical stature, thus informing the development of targeted interventions to maintain mobility and prevent falls in older adults. Despite potential selection bias and the cross-sectional nature of the study, the insights gained provide a solid foundation for further longitudinal studies and diverse sampling to validate and expand upon these findings.",bio-resource,0.95938396,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39860951,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.33808762,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39668120.0,Establishment of cancer cell radiosensitivity database linked to multi-layer omics data.,"Personalized radiotherapy based on the intrinsic sensitivity of individual tumors is anticipated, however, it has yet to be realized. To explore cancer radiosensitivity, analysis in combination with omics data is important. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) provides multi-layer omics data for hundreds of cancer cell lines. However, the radiosensitivity counterpart is lacking. To address this issue, we aimed to establish a database of radiosensitivity, as assessed by the gold standard clonogenic assays, for the CCLE cell lines by collecting data from the literature. A deep learning-based screen of 33,284 papers identified 926 relevant studies, from which SF<sub>2</sub> (survival fraction after 2 Gy irradiation) data were extracted. The median SF<sub>2</sub> (mSF<sub>2</sub>) was calculated for each cell line, generating an mSF<sub>2</sub> database comprising 285 cell lines from 28 cancer types. The mSF<sub>2</sub> showed a normal distribution among higher and lower cancer-type hierarchies, demonstrating a large variation across and within cancer types. In selected cell lines, mSF<sub>2</sub> correlated significantly with the single-institution SF<sub>2</sub> obtained using standardized experimental protocols or with integral survival, a radiosensitivity index that correlates with clonogenic survival. Notably, the mSF<sub>2</sub> for blood cancer cell lines was significantly lower than that for solid cancer cell lines, which is in line with the empirical knowledge that blood cancers are radiosensitive. Furthermore, the CCLE-derived protein levels of NFE2L2 and SQSTM1, which are involved in antioxidant damage responses that confer radioresistance, correlated significantly with mSF<sub>2</sub>.

35469106.0,Towards a National Definition and Database for Nonfatal Shooting Incidents.,"After a decades-long decline, criminal gun violence has increased dramatically in many parts of the USA. Most victims survive their gunshot wounds; however, research and data collection focus primarily on fatal events. In fact, there is no official national definition of a nonfatal shooting incident, nor a repository of these data. This definitional oversight inhibits data-informed policy and practice. The current study involves two data sources: fatal and nonfatal shooting incidents recorded in an internal metropolitan police database and official Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) violent crime data. Shooting incidents in the police database were matched to incidents in the UCR data to determine how they were officially categorized and reported to the FBI. The majority (82.0%) of nonfatal shooting incidents in the UCR data were recorded as Aggravated Assault-Gun, while 16.5% were classified as a violent crime other than an Aggravated Assault-Gun. The UCR data were missing 1.5% of the nonfatal shooting incidents documented by the police database. Almost four-fifths (79.7%) of all Aggravated Assault-Gun incidents in the UCR data did not meet the suggested definition of a nonfatal shooting incident. Overall, official crime statistics are not a good data source for nonfatal shooting incidents. A holistic response to criminal gun violence requires comprehensive, valid, and reliable data collection on all shooting incidents, especially those incidents in which a person is injured by gunfire. Establishing a national definition for a nonfatal shooting incident is the first important step toward effective gun violence prevention and reduction.",bio-resource,0.65598583,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35469106,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.33643582,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

In total, 158 prepacked products belonging to 19 ""quality label"" cheeses were identified in the Greek market. Among them, Feta had the highest share followed by Kasseri, Graviera Kritis, Kefalograviera and Ladotyri Mitilinis with 81, 16, 15, 11 and 9 products found in the market, respectively. For the rest of the 14 cheeses, the share was limited, ranging from 1 to 4. All labelling indications, nutritional information, claims and other labelling data were recorded and analysed in relation to their compliance against European food law requirements. The results of the analysis showed that for only 6 of the 19 cheeses, all products fully complied with EU labelling legislation. Among the 14 mandatory labelling requirements, the lowest overall compliance was observed for allergens declaration (65%). The analysis of the nutritional data showed a remarkable variability between cheeses and products. Differences in the nutritional characteristics were more pronounced among soft, semi-hard, hard and whey cheese. The above data were entered into an archival database. Application of global harmonisation and standardisation guidelines and tools lead to the initialisation of a branded food composition database (BFCD), conceptualising a specialised database for ""quality label"" foods.",bio-resource,0.9193323,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35011104,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.33625054,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38368960.0,Stable isotope composition of pesticides in commercial formulations: The ISOTOPEST database.,"By assessing the changes in stable isotope compositions within individual pesticide molecules, Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) holds the potential to identify and differentiate sources and quantify pesticide degradation in the environment. However, the environmental application of pesticide CSIA is limited by the general lack of knowledge regarding the initial isotopic composition of active substances in commercially available formulations used by farmers. To address this limitation, we established a database aimed at cataloguing and disseminating isotopic signatures in commercial formulations to expand the use of pesticide CSIA. Our study involved the collection of 25 analytical standards and 120 commercial pesticide formulations from 23 manufacturers. Subsequently, 59 commercial formulations and 25 standards were extracted, and each of their active substance was analyzed for both δ<sup>13</sup>C (n = 84) and δ<sup>15</sup>N CSIA (n = 43). The extraction of pesticides did not cause significant isotope fractionation (Δ<sup>13</sup>C and Δ<sup>15</sup>N < 1‰). Incorporating existing literature data, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures varied in a relatively narrow range among pesticide formulations for different pesticides (Δ<sup>13</sup>C and Δ<sup>15</sup>N < 10‰) and within different formulations for a single substance (Δ<sup>13</sup>C and Δ<sup>15</sup>N < 2‰). Overall, this suggests that pesticide CSIA is more suited for identifying pesticide transformation processes rather than differentiating pesticide sources. Moreover, an inter-laboratory comparison showed similar δ<sup>13</sup>C (Δ<sup>13</sup>C ≤ 1.2 ‰) for the targeted substances albeit varying GC-IRMS instruments. Insignificant carbon isotopic fractionation (Δ<sup>13</sup>C < 0.5‰) was observed after 4 years of storing the same pesticide formulations, confirming their viability for long-term storage at 4 °C and future inter-laboratory comparison exercises. Altogether, the ISOTOPEST database, in open access for public use and additional contributions, marks a significant advancement in establishing an environmentally relevant pesticide CSIA approach.",bio-resource,0.984606,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38368960,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.33619773,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35995307.0,Curating the gnomAD database: Report of novel variants in the thyroid peroxidase gene using in silico bioinformatics algorithms and a literature review.,"Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein located at the apical side of the thyroid follicular cells that catalyzes both iodination and coupling of iodotyrosine residues within the thyroglobulin molecule, leading to the synthesis of thyroid hormone. Variants in TPO cause congenital hypothyroidism (CH) by iodide organification defect and are commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. In the present work, we report a detailed population analysis and bioinformatic prediction of the TPO variants indexed in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v2.1.1. The proportion of missense cysteine variants and nonsense, frameshift, and splice acceptor/donor variants were analyzed in each ethnic group (European (Non-Finnish), European (Finnish), African/African Americans, Latino/Admixed American, East Asian, South Asian, Ashkenazi Jewish, Other). The results showed a clear predominance of frameshift variants in the East Asian (82%) and European (Finnish) (75%) population, whereas the splice site variants predominate in African/African Americans (99.46%), Other (96%), Latino/Admixed American (94%), South Asian (86%), European (Non-Finnish) (56%) and Ashkenazi Jewish (56%) populations. The analysis of the distribution of the variants indexed in gnomAD v2.1.1 database revealed that most missense variants identified in the An peroxidase domain map in exon 8, followed by exons 11, 7 and 9, and finally in descending order by exons 10, 6, 12 and 5. In total, 183 novel TPO variants were described (13 missense cysteine's variants, 158 missense variants involving the An peroxidase domain and 12 splicing acceptor or donor sites variants) which were not reported in the literature and that would have deleterious effects on prediction programs. In the gnomAD v2.1.1 population, the estimated prevalence of heterozygous carriers of the potentially damaging variants was 1:77. In conclusion, we provide an updated and curated reference source of new TPO variants for application in clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling.

In the present study, the corpus was expanded with 41 additional speakers, bringing the total to 225. The analysis was also expanded to include three new databases: unique words, lemmas, and morphemes (inflectional, derivational, and compounds). Next, the internal structure of unique words was analyzed to identify roots, inflectional markers, and affixes, as well as the components of compounds. Additionally, a group of 441 speakers of Québec French provided semantic transparency ratings for 3764 derived words. Results from the semantic transparency judgment study show broad inter-individual variability for words of medium transparency. No influence of sociodemographic variables was found.

We generated a comprehensive single-cell atlas of gastric cancer (>200,000 cells) comprising 48 samples from 31 patients across clinical stages and histologic subtypes. We identified 34 distinct cell-lineage states including novel rare cell populations. Many lineage states exhibited distinct cancer-associated expression profiles, individually contributing to a combined tumor-wide molecular collage. We observed increased plasma cell proportions in diffuse-type tumors associated with epithelial-resident KLF2 and stage-wise accrual of cancer-associated fibroblast subpopulations marked by high INHBA and FAP coexpression. Single-cell comparisons between patient-derived organoids (PDO) and primary tumors highlighted inter- and intralineage similarities and differences, demarcating molecular boundaries of PDOs as experimental models. We complemented these findings by spatial transcriptomics, orthogonal validation in independent bulk RNA-sequencing cohorts, and functional demonstration using in vitro and in vivo models. Our results provide a high-resolution molecular resource of intra- and interpatient lineage states across distinct gastric cancer subtypes.<h4>Significance</h4>We profiled gastric malignancies at single-cell resolution and identified increased plasma cell proportions as a novel feature of diffuse-type tumors. We also uncovered distinct cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes with INHBA-FAP-high cell populations as predictors of poor clinical prognosis.

37845247.0,Population-based prevalence and mutational landscape of von Willebrand disease using large-scale genetic databases.,"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the von Willebrand factor gene (VWF). The true global prevalence of VWD has not been accurately established. We estimated the worldwide and within-population prevalence of inherited VWD by analyzing exome and genome data of 141,456 individuals gathered by the genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We also extended our data deepening by mining the main databases containing VWF variants i.e., the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD) and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) with the goal to explore the global mutational spectrum of VWD. A total of 4,313 VWF variants were identified in the gnomAD population, of which 505 were predicted to be pathogenic or already reported to be associated with VWD. Among the 282,912 alleles analyzed, 31,785 were affected by the aforementioned variants. The global prevalence of dominant VWD in 1000 individuals was established to be 74 for type 1, 3 for 2A, 3 for 2B and 6 for 2M. The global prevalences for recessive VWD forms (type 2N and type 3) were 0.31 and 0.7 in 1000 individuals, respectively. This comprehensive analysis provided a global mutational landscape of VWF by means of 927 already reported variants in the HGMD and LOVD datasets and 287 novel pathogenic variants identified in the gnomAD.

39186406.0,"Design, development, and evaluation of a multi-lingual web-based database for informing people regarding driving-impairing medicines.","<h4>Objective</h4>Driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) is a growing traffic safety problem in many countries. It is estimated that 5 to 10% of medicinal drugs may impair driving due to their side effects. Despite the high number of medicinal drugs prescribed in Iran, there is a lack of a database that could provide specialized information regarding medicinal drugs and driving. Therefore, the present study aimed to design, develop, and evaluate a database for informing the general public, drivers, and healthcare providers regarding driving-impairing medicines.<h4>Methods</h4>The Drugs-and-traffic-safety (DATS) database, which has been developed by Road Traffic Injury Research Center (RTIRC), was designed using Java, HTML, JavaScript and MySql database. After completing the testing process, pharmaceutical data (i.e., generic and brand names, route of administration, anatomical classification, etc.), the level of influence of medicinal drugs on driving, and driving-related recommendations based on the level of influence for consumers were entered into the database. A cross-sectional study, and a qualitative study as semi-structured interviews and expert panels were conducted in different target groups to evaluate the DATS. Finally, the evaluation results were used to improve the database. The quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0 and MAXQDA-10, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>The DATS was the only web-based database that could be accessed online <i>via</i> different browsers. The database included information about 1,255 medicinal drugs, and their influence on driving was shown with four colors, i.e., green (insignificant or no effect), yellow (mild effect), orange (moderate effect), and red (severe effect). The database was designed in multiple languages, which could enable users to search for medicinal drug names in both Persian and English. Based on the quantitative results, the mean score of the DATS was 75.10 ± 16.01 (out of 100) from the public viewpoint, indicating that the users were relatively satisfied with the database. Some themes and subthemes were extracted from the qualitative section of the study which revealed the users found DATS a practical, useful, and user-friendly tool.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Considering the positive feedback of users about DATS in the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, implementing DATS in Iran could provide useful advice in terms of the influence of medicinal drugs on driving to the public and traffic users.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used in this study to obtain valuable genomic resources and identify genes differentially expressed between Al-tolerant and Al-susceptible genotypes. Two groups of finger millet genotypes were used: Al-tolerant (215836, 215845, and 229722) and Al-susceptible (212462, 215804 and 238323). The analysis of the RNA-seq data resulted in 198,546 unigenes, 56.5% of which were annotated with significant hits in one or more of the following six databases: NR (48.8%), GO (29.7%), KEGG (45%), PlantTFDB (19.0%), Uniprot (49.2%), and NT (46.2%). It is noteworthy that only 220 unigenes in the NR database had significant hits against finger millet sequences suggesting that finger millet's genomic resources are scarce. The gene expression analysis revealed that 322 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the Al-tolerant and Al-susceptible genotypes, of which 40.7% were upregulated while 59.3% were downregulated in Al-tolerant genotypes. Among the significant DEGs, 54.7% were annotated in the GO database with the top hits being ATP binding (GO:0005524) and DNA binding (GO:0003677) in the molecular function, DNA integration (GO:0015074) and cell redox homeostasis in the biological process, as well as cellular anatomical entity and intracellular component in the cellular component GO classes. Several of the annotated DEGs were significantly enriched for their corresponding GO terms. The KEGG pathway analysis resulted in 60 DEGs that were annotated with different pathway classes, of which carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction were the most prominent. The homologs of a number of significant DEGs have been previously reported as being associated with Al or other abiotic stress responses in various crops, including carboxypeptidase SOL1, HMA3, AP2, bZIP, C3H, and WRKY TF genes. A more detailed investigation of these and other DEGs will enable genomic-led breeding for Al tolerance in finger millet. RNA-seq data analysis also yielded 119,073 SNP markers, the majority of which had PIC values above 0.3, indicating that they are highly informative.

40547665.0,Investigation on the Substrate Specificity of Serine Protease Neuropsin by Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Marmoset Gene Atlas (MGA).,"Serine protease neuropsin is highly expressed in the central nervous system, which regulates brain cognitive function through its proteolytic activity. Neuropsin cleaves heparan sulfate proteoglycan bound to neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) at three specific sites, liberating the ligand domain of NRG-1, which, in turn, induces activation of ErbB4 to release GABA from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Little, however, is known about the selective substrate-cleavage mechanism of neuropsin. We investigated the substrate specificity of neuropsin by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a secreted-peptide database since neuropsin recognizes only a few-residue sequences, and such short sequences are found in multiple proteins of the human proteome. The substrate specificity and catalytic activity of neuropsin depended on multiple factors that are related to the stabilization of the transition state in the enzyme reaction. Namely, the factors are the formation of a salt bridge between neuropsin and the substrate, catalytic triad, reactive conformation, and oxyanion hole. Our MD simulation analysis showed that the SLRFKW sequence is the most favorable sequence to stabilize the transition state. The Marmoset Gene Atlas, which is a database of gene expression in the brain, showed that only a few peptides including NRG-1 have scissoring sites by neuropsin.",bio-resource,0.9518926,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40547665,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.33277786,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39836634.0,Regulatory trends of organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides in cannabis and applications of the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides are common contaminants in cannabis. Due to the status of cannabis as an illicit Schedule I substance at the federal level, there are no unified national guidelines in the United States to mitigate the health risk of pesticide exposure in cannabis. Here, we examined the change in the state-level regulations of organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides in cannabis. The medians of pyrethroid and organophosphate pesticides specified by each state-level jurisdiction increased from zero pesticide in 2019 to 4.5 pyrethroid and 7 organophosphate pesticides in 2023, respectively. Next, we evaluated the potential connections between pyrethroids, organophosphates, cannabinoids, and Parkinson's disease using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Eleven pyrethroids, 30 organophosphates, and 14 cannabinoids were associated with 95 genes to form 3,237 inferred and curated Chemical-Gene-Phenotype-Disease tetramers. Using a behavioral repulsion assay with the whole organism model Caenorhabditis elegans, we examined the effect of cannabinoids and insecticides on depleting dopamine synthesis. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and permethrin, but not Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), results in dose-dependent effects on 1-nonanol repulsive behaviors in C. elegans, indicating dopaminergic neurotoxicity (P < 0.01).

38572262.0,Mapping the evidence on psychosocial interventions for migrant populations: Descriptive analysis of a living database of randomized studies.,"Migrant mental health is a pressing public health issue with wide-ranging implications. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in this population to assess the effects of psychosocial interventions. However, the available evidence is characterized by controversy and fragmentation, with studies focusing on different migrant populations, interventions, outcomes, delivery modalities and settings. Aiming to promote systematic reviews of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in different migrant groups, we have developed a living database of existing RCTs. The development of the database provides an opportunity to map the existing RCT evidence in this population. A total of 135 studies involving 24,859 participants were included in the living database. The distribution of studies by year of publication aligns with the increasing global migrant population in recent years. Most studies focus primarily on adult participants, with a limited representation of children and adolescents, and a prevalence of female participants, which is consistent with epidemiological data, except for older adults, who are underrepresented in research. Studies predominantly focus on refugees and asylum seekers, likely due to their elevated risk of mental health issues, despite the substantial presence of economic migrants worldwide. While studies mainly involve migrants from the Middle East and East Asia, epidemiological data suggest a broader geographic representation, with migrants coming from Eastern Europe, Latin America and South Asia. The present descriptive analysis of RCTs on mental health and psychosocial interventions for migrant populations provides valuable insights into the existing research landscape. It should be used to inform future research efforts, ensuring that studies are more representative of the global migrant population and more responsive to the mental health needs of migrants in different contexts.",bio-resource,0.99614316,1,0,0.5731,0,1,38572262,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.3313767,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37068705.0,"Predicting thrombotic cardiovascular outcomes induced by waterpipe-associated chemicals using comparative toxicogenomic database: Genes, phenotypes, and pathways.","Hookah, or waterpipe, is a tobacco smoking device that has gained popularity in the United States. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that waterpipe smoke (WPS) is associated with various adverse effects on human health, including infectious diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), particularly thrombotic events. However, the molecular mechanisms through which WPS contributes to disease development remain unclear. In this study, we utilized an analytical approach based on the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to integrate chemical, gene, phenotype, and disease data to predict potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of WPS, based on its chemical and toxicant profile. Our analysis revealed that CVDs were among the top disease categories with regard to the number of curated interactions with WPS chemicals. We identified 5674 genes common between those modulated by WPS chemicals and traditional tobacco smoking. The CVDs with the most curated interactions with WPS chemicals were hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction, whereas ""particulate matter"", ""heavy metals"", and ""nicotine"" showed the highest number of curated interactions with CVDs. Our analysis predicted that the potential mechanisms underlying WPS-induced thrombotic diseases involve common phenotypes, such as inflammation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation, which are shared across all thrombotic diseases and the three aforementioned chemicals. In terms of enriched signaling pathways, we identified several, including chemokine and MAPK signaling, with particulate matter exhibiting the most statistically significant association with all 12 significant signaling pathways related to WPS chemicals. Collectively, our predictive comprehensive analysis provides evidence that WPS negatively impacts health and offers insights into the potential mechanisms through which it exerts these effects. This information should guide further research to explore and better understand the WPS and other tobacco product-related health consequences.",bio-resource,0.5325038,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37068705,0.0,title_pattern; usage_kw=2,False,True,False,0,2,0,0.33132094,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

To facilitate this, an oncology biobank and data repository program, also referred to as the ""Moonshot"" program, was launched in 2021 within the Integrated Network Cancer Program of the Allegheny Health Network. A clinical data program (CDP) and biospecimen repository were established, and patient data and blood and tissue samples have been collected prospectively. To date, the study has accrued 2920 patients, predominantly female (61%) and Caucasian (90%), with a mean age of 64 ± 13 years. The most common cancer sites were the endometrium/uterus (12%), lung/bronchus (12%), breast (11%), and colon/rectum (11%). Of patients diagnosed with cancer, 34% were diagnosed at stage I, 25% at stage II, 26% at stage III, and 15% at stage IV. The CDP is designed to support our initiative in advancing personalized cancer research by providing a comprehensive array of patient data, encompassing demographic characteristics, diagnostic details, and treatment responses. The ""Moonshot"" initiative aims to predict therapy responses and clinical outcomes through cancer-related biomarkers.

39085715.0,Prescribing Appropriate Medicines to Older Adults: A Finnish Experience with the Web-Based Meds75+ Database.,"The Finnish web-based Meds75+ database supports rational, safe and appropriate prescribing to older adults in primary care. This article describes the content and updating process of Meds75+ and demonstrates its applicability in everyday clinical practice. Meds75+ contains a classification (A-D) and recommendation texts for 450-500 drug substances when used in the treatment of older adults aged 75 years or older. The content of Meds75+ is continually updated. Each assessment of a drug substance begins with a structured collection of available information and research evidence. After that, an interdisciplinary expert panel discusses the classification and recommendation using a consensus method. A rolling 3-year updating cycle guarantees that all drug substances are reviewed regularly. Most drug substances are classified as class A (41%) (suitable, e.g. bisoprolol) or as class C (37%) (suitable with specific precautions, e.g. ibuprofen). One-fifth (20%) of the substances are in class D (avoid use, e.g. diazepam). Most commonly, older adults have purchased substances affecting the alimentary tract and metabolism (17%), the nervous system (16%) and the cardiovascular system (15%). In Finland, the proportion of older adults using class D substances (37%) has not changed between the years 2019 and 2022. Meds75+ has potential to support safer and more effective use of medications for older adults, since it offers up-to-date information on drug substances for healthcare professionals.",bio-resource,0.9260102,1,1,0.7465,1,1,39085715,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.33021906,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39596552.0,The Chilean COVID-19 Genomics Network Biorepository: A Resource for Multi-Omics Studies of COVID-19 and Long COVID in a Latin American Population.,"Although a lack of diversity in genetic studies is an acknowledged obstacle for personalized medicine and precision public health, Latin American populations remain particularly understudied despite their heterogeneity and mixed ancestry. This gap extends to COVID-19 despite its variability in susceptibility and clinical course, where ethnic background appears to influence disease severity, with non-Europeans facing higher hospitalization rates. In addition, access to high-quality samples and data is a critical issue for personalized and precision medicine, and it has become clear that the solution lies in biobanks. The creation of the Chilean COVID-19 Biorepository reported here addresses these gaps, representing the first nationwide multicentric Chilean initiative. It operates under rigorous biobanking standards and serves as one of South America's largest COVID cohorts. A centralized harmonization strategy was chosen and included unified standard operating procedures, a sampling coding system, and biobanking staff training. Adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection provided broad informed consent. Samples were collected to preserve blood, plasma, buffy coat, and DNA. Quality controls included adherence to the standard preanalytical code, incident reporting, and DNA concentration and absorbance ratio 260/280 assessments. Detailed sociodemographic, health, medication, and preexisting condition data were gathered. In five months, 2262 participants were enrolled, pseudonymized, and sorted by disease severity. The average Amerindian ancestry considering all participant was 44.0% [SD 15.5%], and this value increased to 61.2% [SD 19.5%] among those who self-identified as Native South Americans. Notably, 279 participants self-identified with one of 12 ethnic groups. High compliance (>90%) in all assessed quality controls was achieved. Looking ahead, our team founded the COVID-19 Genomics Network (C19-GenoNet) focused on identifying genetic factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. In conclusion, this bottom-up collaborative effort aims to promote the integration of Latin American populations into global genetic research and welcomes collaborations supporting this endeavor.

37209070.0,Research using the Quality Outcomes Database: accomplishments and future steps toward higher-quality real-world evidence.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) was established in 2012 by the NeuroPoint Alliance, a nonprofit organization supported by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Currently, the QOD has launched six different modules to cover a broad spectrum of neurosurgical practice-namely lumbar spine surgery, cervical spine surgery, brain tumor, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), functional neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease, and cerebrovascular surgery. This investigation aims to summarize research efforts and evidence yielded through QOD research endeavors.<h4>Methods</h4>The authors identified all publications from January 1, 2012, to February 18, 2023, that were produced by using data collected prospectively in a QOD module without a prespecified research purpose in the context of quality surveillance and improvement. Citations were compiled and presented along with comprehensive documentation of the main study objective and take-home message.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 94 studies have been produced through QOD efforts during the past decade. QOD-derived literature has been predominantly dedicated to spinal surgical outcomes, with 59 and 22 studies focusing on lumbar and cervical spine surgery, respectively, and 6 studies focusing on both. More specifically, the QOD Study Group-a research collaborative between 16 high-enrolling sites-has yielded 24 studies on lumbar grade 1 spondylolisthesis and 13 studies on cervical spondylotic myelopathy, using two focused data sets with high data accuracy and long-term follow-up. The more recent neuro-oncological QOD efforts, i.e., the Tumor QOD and the SRS Quality Registry, have contributed 5 studies, providing insights into the real-world neuro-oncological practice and the role of patient-reported outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Prospective quality registries are an important resource for observational research, yielding clinical evidence to guide decision-making across neurosurgical subspecialties. Future directions of the QOD efforts include the development of research efforts within the neuro-oncological registries and the American Spine Registry-which has now replaced the inactive spinal modules of the QOD-and the focused research on high-grade lumbar spondylolisthesis and cervical radiculopathy.",bio-resource,0.986414,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37209070,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.329145,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39525655.0,A benchmark dataset for analyzing hematological responses to dengue fever in Bangladesh.,"Dengue fever is an important public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas, and the understanding of its hematological changes is crucial for the improvement of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This data set presents hematological parameters for the systematic record of patients suffering from dengue infection: age, sex, hemoglobin, WBC count, differential count, RBC panel, platelet count, and PDW. The dataset has in-depth records of patients admitted to Upazila Health Complex, Kalai, Jaipurhat, Bangladesh and thus offers an opportunity for further analysis of hematological changes produced by dengue infection. This dataset is valuable because of the potential contribution that these data will make to developing predictive models for disease severity and patient outcomes, enhancing clinical decision-making. It serves as a benchmark for the comparison of hematological responses across different demographics and geographical locations, adding value to the knowledge of dengue in the world. Moreover, the study has gone further to indicate how the characteristics related to blood may be affected by various treatment regimens, hence offering better treatment protocols. The data preprocessing in this study involved cleaning, normalization, and encoding of the variables before proceeding to perform the statistical analysis. This showed a Chi-Square test for no significant association of sex with the diagnostic outcome, as given by the <i>p</i>-value of 0.277. On the other hand, the Z-test and T-test results indicated a significant difference in the hemoglobin levels concerning gender; the obtained p-values are 2.534 × 10<sup>-8</sup> and 4.325 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively. These findings emphasize how gender influences hematological responses against dengue. In summary, this database will be a great help and will give a leading edge to the research studies of dengue, public health strategies, and improved diagnosis and treatment modalities for patients.",bio-resource,0.80077606,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39525655,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.32904443,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35945534.0,Development of the Arabic Health Measures database: a bibliometric analysis of Arabic health-related measures.,"<h4>Background</h4>To develop an open-access database of Arabic health measures intended for use by researchers and healthcare providers, along with a bibliometric analysis of the measures included in the database.<h4>Methods</h4>A search was conducted up to 31 December 2021 in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, SAGE, Springer and Elsevier for published articles or abstracts with keywords ""Arabic"" AND ""translation"", ""adaptation"" OR ""validation"". Information on the measure and the methodology used in the study was then entered into a database. An open-access platform was developed to allow users to search for measures according to their needs. A bibliometric analysis of the articles and measures was then conducted.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 894 publications met the inclusion criteria. The articles discussed 716 measures that were developed using participants from at least 38 countries. The number of measures for adults was five times that for children. Mental health was the most frequent construct assessed (11.5%), followed by ""function/disability"" measures (10.6%). The majority of measures (54%) required 5 minutes or less to complete. Approximately 17% of the tools were available directly from the article. Saudi Arabia and Lebanon had the greatest number of publications, with 217 (23%) and 114 (12%), respectively. The majority of the publications included reporting of the validation and reliability of the instruments (64% and 56%, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a paucity of research on the quantity and quality of Arabic health measures. Similar to previous reviews, we found the number of publications on Arabic measures to be limited in comparison to those in English; however, it is encouraging that the number of publications appears to have increased steadily over the past decade. While we found the majority of publications reported on psychometric testing, we are unable to comment on the quality of the methodology used, and further investigation into this area is recommended. As the Arabic Health Measures database will facilitate the search for health instruments that have published data on their development, this will increase their visibility and use in research and clinical settings.",bio-resource,0.989021,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35945534,1.0,title_pattern; impl_kw=1; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,1,1,0,0.32891798,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35373160.0,The 2021 WHO catalogue of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex mutations associated with drug resistance: A genotypic analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Molecular diagnostics are considered the most promising route to achieving rapid, universal drug susceptibility testing for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>complex (MTBC). We aimed to generate a WHO endorsed catalogue of mutations to serve as a global standard for interpreting molecular information for drug resistance prediction.<h4>Methods</h4>A candidate gene approach was used to identify mutations as associated with resistance, or consistent with susceptibility, for 13 WHO endorsed anti-tuberculosis drugs. 38,215 MTBC isolates with paired whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing data were amassed from 45 countries. For each mutation, a contingency table of binary phenotypes and presence or absence of the mutation computed positive predictive value, and Fisher's exact tests generated odds ratios and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values. Mutations were graded as Associated with Resistance if present in at least 5 isolates, if the odds ratio was >1 with a statistically significant corrected p-value, and if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval on the positive predictive value for phenotypic resistance was >25%. A series of expert rules were applied for final confidence grading of each mutation.<h4>Findings</h4>15,667 associations were computed for 13,211 unique mutations linked to one or more drugs. 1,149/15,667 (7·3%) mutations were classified as associated with phenotypic resistance and 107/15,667 (0·7%) were deemed consistent with susceptibility. For rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, fluoroquinolones, and streptomycin, the mutations' pooled sensitivity was >80%. Specificity was over 95% for all drugs except ethionamide (91·4%), moxifloxacin (91·6%) and ethambutol (93·3%). Only two resistance mutations were classified for bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine, and linezolid as prevalence of phenotypic resistance was low for these drugs.<h4>Interpretation</h4>This first WHO endorsed catalogue of molecular targets for MTBC drug susceptibility testing provides a global standard for resistance interpretation. Its existence should encourage the implementation of molecular diagnostics by National Tuberculosis Programmes.<h4>Funding</h4>UNITAID, Wellcome, MRC, BMGF.",bio-resource,0.9210748,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35373160,0.5,impl_kw=2; usage_kw=1,False,False,False,2,1,0,0.32867488,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38336780.0,COSMIC-based mutation database enhances identification efficiency of HLA-I immunopeptidome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neoantigens have emerged as a promising area of focus in tumor immunotherapy, with several established strategies aiming to enhance their identification. Human leukocyte antigen class I molecules (HLA-I), which present intracellular immunopeptides to T cells, provide an ideal source for identifying neoantigens. However, solely relying on a mutation database generated through commonly used whole exome sequencing (WES) for the identification of HLA-I immunopeptides, may result in potential neoantigens being missed due to limitations in sequencing depth and sample quality.<h4>Method</h4>In this study, we constructed and evaluated an extended database for neoantigen identification, based on COSMIC mutation database. This study utilized mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic profiling to identify the HLA-I immunopeptidome enriched from HepG2 cell. HepG2 WES-based and the COSMIC-based mutation database were generated and utilized to identify HepG2-specific mutant immunopeptides.<h4>Result</h4>The results demonstrated that COSMIC-based database identified 5 immunopeptides compared to only 1 mutant peptide identified by HepG2 WES-based database, indicating its effectiveness in identifying mutant immunopeptides. Furthermore, HLA-I affinity of the mutant immunopeptides was evaluated through NetMHCpan and peptide-docking modeling to validate their binding to HLA-I molecules, demonstrating the potential of mutant peptides identified by the COSMIC-based database as neoantigens.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Utilizing the COSMIC-based mutation database is a more efficient strategy for identifying mutant peptides from HLA-I immunopeptidome without significantly increasing the false positive rate. HepG2 specific WES-based database may exclude certain mutant peptides due to WES sequencing depth or sample heterogeneity. The COSMIC-based database can effectively uncover potential neoantigens within the HLA-I immunopeptidomes.",bio-resource,0.94025844,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38336780,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.32859725,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38244664.0,Systematic update to the mammalian relative potency estimate database and development of best estimate toxic equivalency factors for dioxin-like compounds.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) assesses potential health risks of dioxin-like compounds using Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs). This study systematically updated the relative potency (REP) database underlying the 2005 WHO TEFs and applied advanced methods for quantitative integration of study quality and dose-response. Data obtained from fifty-one publications more than doubled the size of the previous REP database (∼1300 datasets). REP quality and relevance for these data was assessed via application of a consensus-based weighting framework. Using Bayesian dose-response modeling, available data were modeled to produce standardized dose/concentration-response Hill curves. Study quality and REP data were synthesized via Bayesian meta-analysis to integrate dose/concentration-response data, author-calculated REPs and benchmark ratios. The output is a prediction of the most likely relationship between each congener and its reference as model-predicted TEF uncertainty distributions, or the 'best estimate TEF' (BE-TEF). The resulting weighted BE-TEFs were similar to the 2005 TEFs, though provide more information to inform selection of TEF values as well as to provide risk assessors and managers with information needed to quantitatively characterize uncertainty around TEF values. Collectively, these efforts produce an updated REP database and an objective, reproducible approach to support development of TEF values based on all available data.",bio-resource,0.56880736,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38244664,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.32854897,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

To understand better the usefulness of a blood donor-based biobank in personalised disease-associated genetic studies, and for possible personalised blood donation policies, we evaluated the occurrence and distributions of common and rare disease-associated genetic variants in Finnish Blood Service Biobank. We analysed among 31,880 blood donors the occurrence and geographical distribution of (i) 53 rare Finnish-enriched disease-associated variants, (ii) mutations assumed to influence blood donation: four Bernard-Soulier syndrome and two hemochromatosis mutations, (iii) type I diabetes risk genotype HLA-DQ2/DQ8. In addition, we analysed the level of consanguinity in Blood Service Biobank. 80.3% of blood donors carried at least one (range 0-9 per donor) of the rare variants, many in homozygous form, as well. Donors carrying multiple rare variants were enriched in Eastern Finland. Haemochromatosis mutation HFE C282Y homozygosity was 43.8% higher than expected, whereas mutations leading to Bernard-Soulier thrombocytopenia were rare. The frequency of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotype was slightly lower than expected. First-degree consanguinity was higher in Blood Service Biobank than in the general population. We demonstrate that despite donor selection, the Blood Service Biobank is a valuable resource for personalised medical research and for genotype-selected samples from unaffected individuals. The geographical genetic substructure of Finland enables efficient recruitment of donors carrying rare variants. Furthermore, we show that blood donor biobank material can be utilised for personalised blood donation policies.",bio-resource,0.84670585,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38212662,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.3272104,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

In this study, we collated 3813 RNA-seq data from the public repositories across 23 tissues and carried out comprehensive profiling of RNA editing in pigs. In total, 127,927 A-to-I RNA-editing sites were detected. Our analysis showed that 98.2% of RNA-editing sites were located within repeat regions, primarily within the pig-specific SINE retrotransposon PRE-1/Pre0_SS elements. Subsequently, we focused on analyzing specific RNA-editing sites (SESs) in skeletal muscle tissues. Functional enrichment analyses suggested that they were enriched in signaling pathways associated with muscle cell differentiation, including DMD, MYOD1, and CAV1 genes. Furthermore, we discovered that RNA editing event in the 3'UTR of CFLAR mRNA influenced miR-708-5p binding in this region. In this study, the panoramic RNA-editing landscape of different tissues of pigs was systematically mapped, and RNA-editing sites and genes involved in muscle cell differentiation were identified.

38861351.0,"CAR T-cell toxicities: from bedside to bench, how novel toxicities inform laboratory investigations.","<h4>Abstract</h4>Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are US Food and Drug Administration-approved, and several are under development. Although effective for some cancers, toxicities remain a limitation. The most common toxicities, that is, cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, are well described. With increasing utilization, providers worldwide are reporting other emergent and often complicated toxicities. Given the evolving toxicity profiles and urgent need to catalog these emerging and emergent CAR T-cell toxicities and describe management approaches, the American Society of Hematology Subcommittee on Emerging Gene and Cell Therapies organized the first scientific workshop on CAR T-cell toxicities during the annual society meeting. The workshop functioned to (1) aggregate reports of CAR T-cell emergent toxicities, including movement disorders after B-cell maturation antigen CAR T cell, coagulation abnormalities, and prolonged cytopenia; (2) disseminate bedside-to-bench efforts elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms of CAR T-cell toxicities, including the intestinal microbiota and systemic immune dysregulation; and (3) highlight gaps in the availability of clinical tests, such as cytokine measurements, which could be used to expand our knowledge around the monitoring of toxicities. Key themes emerged. First, although clinical manifestations may develop before the pathophysiologic mechanisms are understood, they must be studied to aid in the detection and prevention of such toxicities. Second, systemic immune dysregulation appears to be central to these emergent toxicities, and research is needed to elucidate the links between tumors, CAR T cells, and microbiota. Finally, there was a consensus around the urgency to create a repository to capture emergent CAR T-cell toxicities and the real-world management.",bio-resource,0.96091366,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38861351,0.5,impl_kw=1,False,False,False,1,0,0,0.32580853,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39777714.0,The Metabolic Treatabolome and Inborn Errors of Metabolism Knowledgebase therapy tool: Do not miss the opportunity to treat!,"Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are rare genetic conditions with significant morbidity and mortality. Technological advances have increased therapeutic options, making it challenging to remain up to date. A centralized therapy knowledgebase is needed for early diagnosis and targeted treatment. This study aimed to identify all treatable IEMs through a scoping literature review, followed by data extraction and analysis according to the Treatabolome principles. Knowledge of treatable IEMs, therapeutic categories, efficacy, and evidence was integrated into the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Knowledgebase (IEMbase), an online database encompassing all IEMs. The study identified 275 treatable IEMs, 18% of all currently known 1564 IEMs, according to the International Classification of Inherited Metabolic Disorders. Disorders of fatty acid and ketone body metabolism had the highest treatability (67%), followed by disorders of vitamin and cofactor metabolism (60%), and disorders of lipoprotein metabolism (42%). The most common treatment strategies were pharmacological therapy (34%), nutritional therapy (34%), and vitamin and trace element supplementation (12%). Treatment effects were most commonly observed in nervous system abnormalities (34%), metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities (33%), and growth (7%). Predominant evidence sources included case reports with evidence levels 4 (48%) and 5 (12%), and individual cohort studies with evidence level 2b (12%). Our study generated the Metabolic Treatabolome 2024. IEMs are the largest group of monogenic disorders amenable to disease-modifying therapy. With drug repurposing efforts and advancements in gene therapies, this number will expand. IEMbase now provides up-to-date, comprehensive information on clinical and biochemical symptoms and therapeutic options, empowering patients, families, healthcare professionals, and researchers in improving patient outcomes.",bio-resource,0.99562955,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39777714,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.3257502,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40878329.0,Comprehensive biobanking to enhance precision medicine in head &amp; neck cancer through systematic sample collection &amp; data integration.,"Background & objectives Head and neck carcinomas (HNCs), including oral cancers (OCs), represent a significant global health issue, especially in India, where they contribute to one-third of the global OC burden. Despite advances in treatment, survival rates remain poor, often due to limited treatment options and underlying research gaps. The Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute & Research Centre (RGCIRC) biorepository initiative undertook to address this gap by systematically collecting and storing biological specimens and their derivatives for HNC, fostering translational research and collaborations. The objective of this initiative was to provide critical resources for researchers and aims to bridge the gap between laboratory findings and clinical applications, ultimately contributing to more effective cancer treatment strategies and personalised medicine approaches in oncology. Methods From 2018 to July 2024, the biobank enrolled HNC patient donors (aged 18+yr) undergoing surgery as a primary mode of treatment at RGCIRC. Following Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the biobank collected diverse biosamples, including fresh frozen tissues, plasma, PBMC, FFPE, and more. A robust Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) ensured systematic sample tracking and efficient disbursal. Complex derivatives were processed to minimise pre analytical variability, supporting high-quality research applications. Results The HNC biobank successfully enrolled 1, 300 donors during the study period and stored 13,000 biosample aliquots, with buccal mucosa identified as the most prevalent cancer site. A significant proportion of the patients presented with advanced-stage cancers (III and IV), accounting for 62.67 per cent of the biosamples collected, highlighting the critical need for targeted research in this area. Notably, the samples exhibited considerable cellular heterogeneity across different anatomical sites. Additionally, lower cellular viability was observed in samples from gingivobuccalsulcus (GBS) cancers compared to those from other sites. The biobank's 34 per cent sample disbursal rate underscores its role in facilitating diverse research projects, there by contributing valuable insights into HNC biology and treatment strategies. Interpretation & conclusions The RGCIRC biobank is pivotal for advancing HNC research, enabling genomic and cellular diversity studies, biomarker discovery, and personalised treatments. It has the potential to lay the foundation for multi-omics research and the future of translational efforts in HNC.",bio-resource,0.9174252,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40878329,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.32557958,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39577596.0,"Determinants of antimicrobial resistance in biosolids: A systematic review, database, and meta-analysis.","Biosolids can provide a nutrient rich soil amendment, particularly for poor soils and semi-arid or drought-prone areas. However, there are concerns that sludge and biosolids could be a source of propagation and exposure to AMR determinants such as antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). To inform risk assessment efforts, a systematic literature review was performed to build a comprehensive spreadsheet database of ARB and ARG concentrations in biosolids (and some sludges specified as intended for land application), along with 69 other quantitative and qualitative meta-data fields from 68 published studies describing sampling information and processing methods that can be used for modeling purposes. Mean ARG concentrations per gram in positive samples of biosolids ranged from -5.7 log<sub>10</sub>(gene copies [gc]/g) to 12.92 log<sub>10</sub>(gc/g) (with these range values reported per dry weight), and aqueous concentrations ranged from 0.9 log<sub>10</sub>(gc/L) to 14.6 log<sub>10</sub>(gc/L). Mean ARB concentrations per gram of biosolids ranged from 2.02 log<sub>10</sub> (colony forming units [CFU]/g) to 9.00 log<sub>10</sub> (CFU/g) (dry weight), and aqueous concentrations ranged from 3.23 log<sub>10</sub> (CFU/L) to 12.0 log<sub>10</sub> (CFU/L). ARG log removal values (LRVs) during sewage sludge stabilization were calculated from a meta-analysis of mean concentrations before and after stabilization from 31 studies, ranging from -2.05 to 5.52 logs. The classes of resistance most relevant for a risk assessment corresponded to sulfonamide (sul1 and sul2), tetracycline (tetZ, tetX, tetA and tetG), beta-lactam (bla<sub>TEM</sub>), macrolide (ermB and ermF), aminoglycoside (strA and aac(6')-Ib-cr), and integron-associated (intI1). The resistance classes most relevant for ARB risk assessment included sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine), cephalosporin (cephalothin and cefoxitin), penicillin (ampicillin), and ciprofloxin (ciprofloxacin).

The diverse causes of hearing loss, combined with the highly variable and often overlapping presentations of different forms of hearing loss, challenge the ability of traditional clinical evaluations to arrive at an etiologic diagnosis for many deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. However, identifying the etiology of hearing loss may affect clinical management, improve prognostic accuracy, and refine genetic counseling and assessment of the likelihood of recurrence for relatives of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Linguistic and cultural identities associated with being deaf or hard-of-hearing can complicate access to and the effectiveness of clinical care. These concerns can be minimized when genetic and other health care services are provided in a linguistically and culturally sensitive manner.

It is characterized by marked clinical heterogeneity with individuals experiencing minimal to no symptoms, while others may have more severe outcomes including heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Genetic testing for HCM is increasingly available due to advances in DNA sequencing technologies and reduced costs. While a diagnosis of HCM is a well-supported indication for genetic testing and genetic counseling, incorporation of genetic services into the clinical setting is often limited outside of expert centers. As genetic counseling and testing have become more accessible and convenient, optimal integration of genomic data into the clinical care of individuals with HCM should be instituted, including delivery via genetic counseling. Drawing on recommendations from recent disease guidelines and systematic evidence reviews, we highlight key recommendations for HCM genetic testing and counseling.

The study of genetic variations among breast cancer subtypes at single-cell resolution has potential to deepen our insights into cancer progression.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we amalgamate single-cell RNA sequencing data from patient tumours and matched lymph metastasis, reduction mammoplasties, breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), and cell lines resulting in a diverse dataset of 117 samples with 506 719 total cells. These samples encompass hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes, including isogenic model pairs. Herein, we delineated similarities and distinctions across models and patient samples and explore therapeutic drug efficacy based on subtype proportions.<h4>Results</h4>PDX models more closely resemble patient samples in terms of tumour heterogeneity and cell cycle characteristics when compared with TNBC cell lines. Acquired drug resistance was associated with an increase in basal-like cell proportions within TNBC PDX tumours as defined with SCSubtype and TNBCtype cell typing predictors. All patient samples contained a mixture of subtypes; compared to primary tumours HR+ lymph node metastases had lower proportions of HER2-Enriched cells. PDXOs exhibited differences in metabolic-related transcripts compared to PDX tumours. Correlative analyses of cytotoxic drugs on PDX cells identified therapeutic efficacy was based on subtype proportion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We present a substantial multimodel dataset, a dynamic approach to cell-wise sample annotation, and a comprehensive interrogation of models within systems of human breast cancer. This analysis and reference will facilitate informed decision-making in preclinical research and therapeutic development through its elucidation of model limitations, subtype-specific insights and novel targetable pathways.<h4>Key points</h4>Patient-derived xenografts models more closely resemble patient samples in tumour heterogeneity and cell cycle characteristics when compared with cell lines. 3D organoid models exhibit differences in metabolic profiles compared to their in vivo counterparts.

38190915.0,Database of emission factors of volatile organic compound (VOC) species in motor vehicle exhaust in China.,"The synergistic strategy for fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and O<sub>3</sub> pollution prevention and control has emerged as a pivotal approach in combating air pollution. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) serve as crucial precursors to both O<sub>3</sub> and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), with motor vehicles representing one of their significant sources. In this study, a standard for establishing a database of VOC species emission factors for motor vehicles was developed, and a database containing 134 VOC species was constructed through field tests and literature surveys. The VOC emissions of light-duty gasoline passenger vehicles (LDGPVs) comprised primarily alkanes and aromatics. The VOC emissions of light-duty diesel trucks (LDDTs) comprised mostly alkanes. Regarding low-speed trucks, 3-wheel vehicles, medium-duty diesel trucks (MDDTs) and heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs), their VOC emissions comprised mainly oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs). The update of emission standards resulted in a reduction in VOC species emission factors while altering the composition of VOCs. Attention should be directed toward isopentane, benzene and dichloromethane emitted by LDGPVs, dodecane, undecane, ethene and propene emitted by LDDTs, and acetaldehyde emitted by HDDTs. VOC species originating from LDGPVs were more dispersed than those originating from LDDTs and HDDTs. In addition, variations in VOC species were observed among motor vehicles with different fuel types. Toluene, ethene, benzene, m,p-xylene, isopentane, hexanal, ethyne and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were the predominant VOC species emitted by gasoline vehicles. Diesel vehicles emitted mainly dodecane, formaldehyde, propene, undecane, acetaldehyde, ethene, decane and benzene. The results could enhance our comprehension of the emission characteristics of VOC species originating from motor vehicles and provide data support and a scientific foundation for achieving synergistic PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> pollution prevention and control.",bio-resource,0.97011495,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38190915,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.32296643,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The CIPATOX-PE database, created in 2018, listed the PAS authorized in France between 1961 and 2014 presenting endocrine-disrupting effects for humans according to data from official international organizations. Since the creation of CIPATOX-PE, European regulations have changed, and new initiatives identifying substances with endocrine-disrupting effects have been implemented and new PAS have been licensed.<h4>Objectives</h4>The study aimed to update the CIPATOX-PE database by considering new 2018 European endocrine-disrupting effect identification criteria as well as the new PAS authorized on the market in France since 2015.<h4>Methods</h4>The endocrine-disrupting effect assessment of PAS from five international governmental and non-governmental initiatives was reviewed, and levels of evidence were retained by these initiatives for eighteen endocrine target organs.<h4>Results</h4>The synthesis of the identified endocrine-disrupting effects allowed to assign an endocrine-disrupting effect level of concern for 241 PAS among 980 authorized in France between 1961 and 2021. Thus, according to the updated CIPATOX-PE data, 44 PAS (18.3%) had an endocrine-disrupting effect classified as ""high concern,"" 133 PAS (55.2%) ""concern,"" and 64 PAS (26.6%) ""unknown effect"" in the current state of knowledge. In the study, 42 PAS with an endocrine-disrupting effect of ""high concern"" are similarly classified in CIPATOX-PE-2018 and 2021, and 2 new PAS were identified as having an endocrine-disrupting effect of ""high concern"" in the update, and both were previously classified with an endocrine-disrupting effect of ""concern"" in CIPATOX-PE-2018. Finally, a PAS was identified as having an endocrine-disrupting effect of ""high concern"" in CIPATOX-PE-2018 but is now classified as a PAS not investigated for endocrine-disrupting effects in CIPATOX-PE-2021. The endocrine target organs associated with the largest number of PAS with an endocrine-disrupting effect of ""high concern"" is the reproductive system with 31 PAS.

This type of testing has the potential to detect genetic conditions before there is a significant health impact permitting earlier management and/or treatment. Pre- and post-test counseling for EGT is similar to indication-based genetic testing. Both require a complete family and medical history when ordering a test or interpreting a result. However, EGT counseling has some special considerations including greater uncertainties around penetrance and clinical utility and a lack of published guidelines. While certain considerations in the selection of a high-quality genetic testing laboratory are universal, there are some considerations that are unique to the selection of a laboratory performing EGT. This practice resource intends to provide guidance for genetic counselors and other healthcare providers caring for adults seeking pre- or post-test counseling for EGT.

35581438.0,The taste & affect music database: Subjective rating norms for a new set of musical stimuli.,"Music is a ubiquitous stimulus known to influence human affect, cognition, and behavior. In the context of eating behavior, music has been associated with food choice, intake and, more recently, taste perception. In the latter case, the literature has reported consistent patterns of association between auditory and gustatory attributes, suggesting that individuals reliably recognize taste attributes in musical stimuli. This study presents subjective norms for a new set of 100 instrumental music stimuli, including basic taste correspondences (sweetness, bitterness, saltiness, sourness), emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise), familiarity, valence, and arousal. This stimulus set was evaluated by 329 individuals (83.3% women; M<sub>age</sub> = 28.12, SD = 12.14), online (n = 246) and in the lab (n = 83). Each participant evaluated a random subsample of 25 soundtracks and responded to self-report measures of mood and taste preferences, as well as the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI). Each soundtrack was evaluated by 68 to 97 participants (Mdn = 83), and descriptive results (means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals) are available as supplemental material at osf.io/2cqa5 . Significant correlations between taste correspondences and emotional/affective dimensions were observed (e.g., between sweetness ratings and pleasant emotions). Sex, age, musical sophistication, and basic taste preferences presented few, small to medium associations with the evaluations of the stimuli.

PSE research has been scattered worldwide with varying methodologies and data reporting. To address this, we established the International Post-stroke Epilepsy Research Consortium (IPSERC) to integrate global PSE research efforts. This protocol outlines an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) to determine outcomes in patients with post-stroke seizures (PSS) and develop/validate PSE prediction models, comparing them with existing models. This protocol informs about creating the International Post-stroke Epilepsy Research Repository (IPSERR) to support future collaborative research.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We utilised a comprehensive search strategy and searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases until 30 January 2023. We extracted observational studies of stroke patients aged ≥18 years, presenting early or late PSS with data on patient outcome measures, and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We did not apply any restriction based on the date or language of publication. We will invite these study authors and the IPSERC collaborators to contribute IPD to IPSERR. We will review the IPD lodged within IPSERR to identify patients who developed epileptic seizures and those who did not. We will merge the IPD files of individual data and standardise the variables where possible for consistency. We will conduct an IPD-MA to estimate the prognostic value of clinical characteristics in predicting PSE.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethics approval is not required for this study.

However, these data are still lacking for the Chinese population. In this study, we constructed a pharmacogenomic landscape and an associated database using whole-genome sequencing data generated by non-invasive prenatal testing in 206,640 Chinese individuals. In total, 1,577,513 variants (including 331,610 novel variants) were identified among 3,538 pharmacogenes related to 2,086 drugs. We found that the variant spectrum in the Chinese population differed among the seven major regions. Regional differences also exist among provinces in China. The average numbers of drug enzyme, transporter, and receptor variants were 258, 557, and 632, respectively. Subsequent correlation analysis indicated that the pharmacogenes affecting multiple drugs had fewer variants. Among the 16 categories of drugs, we found that nervous system, cardiovascular system, and genitourinary system/sex hormone drugs were more likely to be affected by variants of pharmacogenes. Characteristics of the variants in the enzyme, transporter, and receptor subfamilies showed specificity. To explore the clinical utility of these data, a genetic association study was conducted on 1,019 lung cancer patients.

The aim of this work is to explore the role of genes and genetic variations in the development and progression of PTSD.<h4>Methods</h4>Through three methodological approaches, 122 genes and 184 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with PTSD were compiled into a single gene repository for PTSD. Using PharmGKB and DrugTargetor, 323 drug candidates were identified to target these 122 genes. The top 17 drug candidates were selected based on the statistical significance of the genetic associations, and their promiscuity (number of associated genestargets) and were further assessed for their suitability in terms of bioavailability and drug-like characteristics. Through functional analysis, insights were gained into the biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions involved in PTSD. This formed the foundation for the next aspect of this study which was to propose an efficient treatment for PTSD by exploring drug repurposing methods.<h4>Results</h4>The main aim was to identify the drugs with the most favorable profile that can be used as a pharmacological approach for PTSD treatment. More in particular, according to the genetic variations present in each individual, the relevant biological pathway can be identified, and the drug candidate proposed will specifically target said pathway, accounting for the personalized aspect of this work. The results showed that the drugs used as off-label treatment for PTSD have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and the potential drug candidates that arose from DrugTargetor were not very promising.

36757429.0,Development of a Pediatric Cardiology Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Database.,"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides clinicians with information vital to the management of pediatric cardiology patients. CPET can also be used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in these patients. CRF is a robust marker of overall health in children. However, a complete understanding of CRF in pediatric cardiology patients is limited by lack of large, standardized CPET databases. Our purpose was to develop a standardized CPET database, describe available data at our institution, and discuss challenges and opportunities associated with this project. CPETs performed from 1993 to present in an urban pediatric hospital were collected and compiled into a research database. Historical data included demographic and clinical variables and CPET outcomes, and additional variables were calculated and coded to facilitate analyses in these cohorts. Patient diagnoses were coded to facilitate sub-analyses of specific cohorts. Quality assurance protocols were established to ensure future database contributions and promote inter-institutional collaborations. This database includes 10,319 CPETs (56.1% male), predominantly using the Bruce Protocol. Patients ranging from ages 6 to 18 years comprise 86.8% of available CPETs. Diagnosis classification scheme includes patients with structurally normal hearts (n = 3,454), congenital heart disease (n = 3,614), electrophysiological abnormalities (n = 2,082), heart transplant or cardiomyopathy (n = 833), and other diagnoses (n = 336). Historically, clinicians were provided with suboptimal interpretive resources for CPET, often generalizing inferences from these resources to non-representative clinical populations.

We set out two primary objectives, namely (1) to develop standard operating procedures for genetic sample collection and storage, DNA isolation, and data integration into an existing multicenter database; and (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of correlating genetic variation to functional outcomes in a pilot study, using the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. Dubbed the worrier/warrior gene, COMT variants have been associated with varying phenotypes of post-traumatic stress, wellbeing, and resilience. Between August 2018 and July 2020, COMT variants were identified for 111 participants from three sites and correlated with their outcome data. We found no association between COMT variants and functional outcomes, likely due to the inadequate sample size. We also asked all potential participants why they consented to or refused genetic analysis. A thematic analysis of responses revealed altruism and personal interest/enthusiasm in the study as top reasons for consenting. Privacy concerns were the most common reason for refusal.

39617446.0,[Development of Image Database for Kiken-yochi Training (KYT) in Radiology Practice].,"Kiken-yochi Training (KYT) has been introduced in many hospitals as medical safety education in many departments, with the exception of radiology. KYT is also not used in the contents of medical safety lectures in the education of students for radiological technologists. One of the reasons for this is that the images for KYT (KYT images) cannot be created at each hospital or easily obtained on the website. The purpose of this research is to construct a database of KYT images (KYTDB) that can be used for medical safety education at hospitals and educational facilities. We also investigate the usefulness of KYTDB in FROC observer experiments. The KYT images were taken in various scenarios of routine medical examination (or treatment) in the radiology department of the two hospitals. A total of 367 KYT images were taken in seven sections of the radiology department, some containing dangerous (inappropriate) locations and languages, and some containing normal scenes. In addition, educational training materials in PowerPoint with audio were created for self-study of KYT. A FROC observer study was conducted using sample images extracted from the KYTDB that were not used in the educational materials, and figures of merit values were used to quantify the predictive risk reduction capacity of KYT. The results demonstrated that the KYTDB is useful for KYT education.",bio-resource,0.9537772,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39617446,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.31919163,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40145404.0,A breast cancer PDX collection enriched in luminal (ER&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) tumors and young premenopausal patients to identify new therapeutic strategies for high-risk patients&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;.,"Breast cancer includes a group of neoplasms originating from mammary gland epithelial cells caused by a variety of genetic alterations, with different responses to treatments and outcomes. In clinical practice, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression guides the distinction between luminal A (ER<sup>+</sup>, PR<sup>+</sup>, HER2<sup>-</sup>), luminal B (ER<sup>+</sup>, PR<sup>+</sup>, HER2<sup>+/-</sup>), and triple-negative (ER<sup>-</sup>, PR<sup>-</sup>, HER2<sup>-</sup>), each with a distinct biological behavior and clinical and therapeutic implications. Approximately 11% of breast cancers are diagnosed in young premenopausal women aged 20-49 years. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) offer a powerful solution to integrate personalized medicine and novel therapeutic agents. Dr Belletti's group recently developed a PDX biobank composed of 26 PDX lines highly enriched in luminal A and B and young premenopausal breast cancer patients. The bank faithfully recapitulates the characteristics of the original tumors. A major focus of their research was to exploit these PDXs to assess the resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), which are critical in managing advanced luminal breast cancers. Their effort addresses a significant gap in existing PDX models, which are limited for these patient subgroups, thereby enabling deeper insights into tumor biology and therapeutic responses in these understudied populations. © 2025 The Author(s).

35783311.0,Establishment of a Simple Pediatric Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Database Based on the Structured Electronic Medical Records.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to establish a pediatric lower respiratory tract infections (PLRTIs) database based on the structured electronic medical records (SEMRs), to provide a brief overview and the usage process of the SEMRs and the database.<h4>Methods</h4>All the medical information is recorded by a clinical information system developed by Eureka Systems Company. A plugin of the software was used to set the properties of items of the SEMR. Children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) who were admitted to the department of respiratory medicine of our hospital from May 2020 were included. PostgreSQL 13.1 software was used to construct the PLRTIs database.<h4>Results</h4>Seven kinds of SEMRs were established, and the admission record was the most important and complex among them. It was mainly composed of 10 parts, i.e., basic information, history of present illness, past history (without respiratory disease), past history of respiratory diseases, personal history, family history, physical examination, the score of LRTIs, auxiliary examination, and diagnosis. With the three-level doctor ward round, the recorded information of the SEMR would be checked repeatedly, thus guaranteeing the correctness of the information. The data of the SEMR and laboratory tests could be extracted directly from the hospital information system (HIS) by PostgreSQL 13.1 software with the specific structured query language (SQL) code. After manually checking the original records, the datasets were imported into PostgreSQL 13.1 software, and a simple PLRTIs database was constructed. According to the inclusion criteria of this study, a total of 1,184 children with LRTIs were included in this database from 1 May 2020 to 30 April 2021.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A series of SEMRs for PLRTIs were designed and used during the hospitalization. A simple PLRTIs database was established based on the SEMR. The SEMRs will provide complete and high-quality data on LRTIs in children.",bio-resource,0.97219265,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35783311,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.31860295,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Evidence-based approaches to managing variceal hemorrhage are limited by the scarcity of data related to this rare entity. Multicenter international registries are increasingly utilized to garner critical information about rare diseases. The International Multicenter Pediatric Portal Hypertension Registry (IMPPHR) was developed to acquire pediatric data about the mortality of first variceal hemorrhage and approaches to primary and second prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage with a goal of improving outcomes in children with portal hypertension. IMPPHR evolved from pediatric portal hypertension symposia at the Baveno V and VI meetings in 2010 and 2015, with a formal executive committee initiating the development of IMPPHR in 2019. The registry opened in 2020, with data closure in 2024, including information from 44 centers and >700 subjects.

35679331.0,Identifying new drugs associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension: A WHO pharmacovigilance database disproportionality analysis.,"Since the 1960s, several drugs have been linked to the onset or aggravation of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): dasatinib, some amphetamine-like appetite suppressants (aminorex, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, benfluorex) and recreational drugs (methamphetamine). Moreover, in numerous cases, the implication of other drugs with PAH have been suggested, but the precise identification of iatrogenic aetiologies of PAH is challenging given the scarcity of this disease and the potential long latency period between drug intake and PAH onset. In this context, we used the World Health Organization's pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase, to generate new hypotheses about drug associated PAH.<h4>Methods</h4>We used VigiBase, the largest pharmacovigilance database worldwide to generate disproportionality signals through the Bayesian neural network method. All disproportionality signals were further independently reviewed by experts in pulmonary arterial hypertension, pharmacovigilance and vascular pharmacology and their plausibility ranked according to World Health Organization causality categories.<h4>Results</h4>We included 2184 idiopathic PAH cases, yielding a total of 93 disproportionality signals. Among them, 25 signals were considered very likely, 15 probable, 28 possible and 25 unlikely. Notably, we identified 4 new protein kinases inhibitors (lapatinib, lorlatinib, ponatinib and ruxolitinib), 1 angiogenesis inhibitor (bevacizumab), and several chemotherapeutics (etoposide, trastuzumab), antimetabolites (cytarabine, fludarabine, fluorouracil, gemcitabine) and immunosuppressants (leflunomide, thalidomide, ciclosporin).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Such signals represent plausible adverse drug reactions considering the knowledge of iatrogenic PAH, the drugs' biological and pharmacological activity and the characteristics of the reported case. Although confirmatory studies need to be performed, the signals identified may help clinicians envisage an iatrogenic aetiology when faced with a patient who develops PAH.",bio-resource,0.5502475,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35679331,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.3178298,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35597369.0,COVID-19 Living Overview of Evidence repository is highly comprehensive and can be used as a single source for COVID-19 studies.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>The coronavirus disease 2019 Living OVerview of Evidence (COVID-19 L·OVE) is a public repository and classification platform for COVID-19 articles. The repository contains more than 430,000 articles as of September 20, 2021 and intends to provide a one-stop shop for COVID-19 evidence. Considering that systematic reviews conduct high-quality searches, this study assesses the comprehensiveness and currency of the repository against the total number of studies in a representative sample of COVID-19 systematic reviews.<h4>Methods</h4>Our sample was generated from all the studies included in the systematic reviews of COVID-19 published during April 2021. We estimated the comprehensiveness of COVID-19 L·OVE repository by determining how many of the individual studies in the sample were included in the COVID-19 L·OVE repository. We estimated the currency as the percentage of studies that was available in the COVID-19 L·OVE repository at the time the systematic reviews conducted their own search.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 83 eligible systematic reviews that included 2,132 studies. COVID-19 L·OVE had an overall comprehensiveness of 99.67% (2,125/2,132). The overall currency of the repository, that is, the proportion of articles that would have been obtained if the search of the reviews was conducted in COVID-19 L·OVE instead of searching the original sources, was 96.48% (2,057/2,132). Both the comprehensiveness and the currency were 100% for randomized trials (82/82).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The COVID-19 L·OVE repository is highly comprehensive and current. Using this repository instead of traditional manual searches in multiple databases can save a great amount of work to people conducting systematic reviews and would improve the comprehensiveness and timeliness of evidence syntheses. This tool is particularly important for supporting living evidence synthesis processes.",bio-resource,0.9880271,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35597369,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.31730023,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The survival outcomes of many gynecological malignancies have greatly improved as a result. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have revealed that drug efficacy and adverse event profiles are not always uniform. Thus, it is important to validate new treatment options in each country to safely and efficiently provide newly developed treatment options to patients with gynecological malignancies. The Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) is conducting 5 cohort studies (JGOG 3026, 3027, 3028, 3030, and 3031) to establish real-world data (RWD) of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor use in patients with advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. The RWD constructed will be used to provide newly developed PARP inhibitors for women with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer in a safer and more efficient manner as well as to develop further treatment options. In 2022, The JGOG, Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group, Chinese Gynecologic Cancer Society, and Taiwanese Gynecologic Oncology Group established the East Asian Gynecologic Oncology Trial Group to collaborate with East Asian countries in clinical research on gynecologic malignancies and disseminate new knowledge on gynecologic malignancies from Asia.

Over the past 16 years, Wake Forest has evaluated > 250 previously irradiated rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that were exposed to single total body irradiation (IR) doses of 1.14-8.5 Gy or to partial body exposures of up to 10 Gy (5% bone marrow sparing) or 10.75 Gy (whole thorax). Though primarily used to examine IR effects on disease-specific processes or to develop radiation countermeasures, this resource provides insights on resilience across physiologic systems and its relationship with biological aging. Exposure to IR has well documented deleterious effects on health, but the late effects of IR are highly variable. Some animals exhibit multimorbidity and accumulated health deficits, whereas others remain relatively resilient years after exposure to total body IR. This provides an opportunity to evaluate biological aging at the nexus of resilient/vulnerable responses to a stressor. Consideration of inter-individual differences in response to this stressor can inform individualized strategies to manage late effects of radiation exposure, and provide insight into mechanisms underlying systemic resilience and aging. The utility of this cohort for age-related research questions was summarized at the 2022 Trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group's Workshop on Animal Models for Geroscience. We present a brief review of radiation injury and its relationship to aging and resilience in NHPs with a focus on the RLEC.",bio-resource,0.5247769,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37188889,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.31614012,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Here we sequenced the RIT2 and GPM6B STRs in 600 human subjects, consisting of late-onset neurocognitive disorder (n = 200), multiple sclerosis (n = 200), and controls (n = 200). Furthermore, we selected two large human databases, including the general-population-based gnomAD ( https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org ) and a mainly disease-phenotype-archiving database, TOPMed ( https://www.nhlbiwgs.org ), to compare allele frequencies in the general populations vs. the disease compartment. The RIT2 and GPM6B GA-repeats were monomorphic in the human subjects studied, at lengths of 11 and 9-repeats, respectively, and were predominantly human-specific in formula. Exception included a 9/11 genotype of the RIT2 GA-STR in an isolate case of female multiple sclerosis. Exceedingly rare alleles of the two GA repeats were significantly enriched in TOPMed vs. the gnomAD. We report prime instances of predominant monomorphism for specific lengths of STRs in human, and possible enrichment of rare divergent alleles in the disease phenotype compartment. While STRs are most attended because of their high polymorphic nature, STR monomorphism is an underappreciated feature, which may have a link with natural selection and disease.",bio-resource,0.79491514,1,0,0.5837,0,1,34984576,1.0,has_url,False,False,True,0,0,0,0.3153431,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Since the advent of forensic molecular genetics, the construction of local reference databases became mandatory. Aiming to further extend the technical quality reference database of Argentina, we present herein the allele frequencies for 24 autosomal STRs, including D22S1045, and SE33 (not previously reported for Argentina in STRidER).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Genotypes of 6454 unrelated individuals (3761 males and 2694 females) from 13 out of 23 provinces were analysed. Forensic parameters were calculated for each marker. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.661 (TPOX) to 0.941 (SE33). The locus SE33 was revealed to be the most informative marker showing the highest values for PIC (0.955), GD (0.952), TPI (8.455) and PE (0.879). On the other hand, TPOX turned out to be the least informative marker: PIC (0.618), GD (0.669), and PE (0.371). The high number of analyzed individuals allowed detecting low frequency alleles and microvariants in CSF1PO; D16S539 and D21S11 D18S51; PENTA D; PENTA E and at locus D6S1043.<h4>Methods and results</h4>This study is the most extensive for Argentina and complements the already reported information concerning the autosomal STRs commonly used in forensic identification.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of genes regulating tumorigenesis and progression. Prior bulk transcriptomic studies in PDAC have revealed the dysregulation of lncRNAs but lack single-cell resolution to distinguish lncRNAs in tumor-intrinsic biology and the tumor microenvironment (TME). We analyzed single-cell transcriptome data from 73 multiregion samples in 21 PDAC patients to evaluate lncRNAs associated with intratumoral heterogeneity and the TME in PDAC. We found 111 cell-specific lncRNAs that reflected tumor, immune and stromal cell contributions, associated with outcomes, and validated across orthogonal datasets. Single-cell analysis of tumor cells revealed lncRNAs associated with <i>TP53</i> mutations and FOLFIRINOX treatment that were obscured in bulk tumor analysis. Lastly, tumor subcluster analysis revealed widespread intratumor heterogeneity and intratumoral lncRNAs associated with cancer hallmarks and tumor processes such as angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metabolism and immune signaling. Intratumoral subclusters and lncRNAs were validated across six datasets and showed clinically relevant associations with patient outcomes. Our study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the lncRNA landscape in PDAC using single-cell transcriptomic data and can serve as a resource, PDACLncDB (accessible at https://www.maherlab.com/pdaclncdb-overview), to guide future functional studies.",bio-resource,0.9929288,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38023733,0.5,has_url; impl_kw=1; usage_kw=2,False,False,True,1,2,0,0.31320235,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35832053.0,Diet Sustainability Analyses Can Be Improved With Updates to the Food Commodity Intake Database.,"Diet sustainability analyses inform policymaking decisions and provide clinicians and consumers with evidence-based information to make dietary changes. In the United States, the Food Commodity Intake Database (FCID) provides a crosswalk for integrating nationally representative data on food intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with data on sustainability outcomes from other publicly available databases. However, FCID has not been updated since 2010 and does not link with contemporary NHANES data, which limits further advancements in sustainability research. This study fills this research gap by establishing novel linkages between FCID and NHANES 2011-2018, comparing daily per capita food intake with and without these linkages, and making these data publicly available for use by other researchers. To update FCID, two investigators independently established novel data linkages, a third investigator resolved discrepancies, and a fourth investigator audited linkages for accuracy. Dietary data were acquired from nearly 45,000 adults from 2001 to 2018, and food intake was compared between updated vs. non-updated FCID versions. Total food intake from 2011 to 2018 was 5-23% higher using the updated FCID compared to the non-updated version, and intake was over 100% higher in some years for some food categories including poultry, eggs, legumes, starchy vegetables, and tropical oils (<i>P</i> < 0.001 for all comparisons). Further efforts may be needed to create new food composition data to reflect new products and reformulations that enter the food supply over time. This study removes a barrier to further diet sustainability analyses by establishing a data crosswalk between contemporary NHANES and other publicly available databases on agricultural resource use, environmental impacts, and consumer food expenditures.",bio-resource,0.61425436,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35832053,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.31282783,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

For more comprehensive understanding and hypothesis-generation, we produced an open-source catalog of autism associations with family histories of mental, neurologic, cardiometabolic, birth defect, asthma, allergy, and autoimmune conditions. All live births in Denmark, 1980-2012, of Denmark-born parents (1,697,231 births), and their 3-generation family members were followed through April 10, 2017 for each of 90 diagnoses (including autism), emigration or death. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated via Cox regression for each diagnosis-family member type combination, adjusting for birth year, sex, birth weight, gestational age, parental ages at birth, and number of family member types of index person; aHRs also calculated for sex-specific co-occurrence of each disorder.

36579417.0,Assembling a global database of child pneumonia studies to inform WHO pneumonia management algorithm: Methodology and applications.,"<h4>Background</h4>The existing World Health Organization (WHO) pneumonia case management guidelines rely on clinical symptoms and signs for identifying, classifying, and treating pneumonia in children up to 5 years old. We aimed to collate an individual patient-level data set from large, high-quality pre-existing studies on pneumonia in children to identify a set of signs and symptoms with greater validity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and possible treatment of childhood pneumonia for the improvement of current pneumonia case management guidelines.<h4>Methods</h4>Using data from a published systematic review and expert knowledge, we identified studies meeting our eligibility criteria and invited investigators to share individual-level patient data. We collected data on demographic information, general medical history, and current illness episode, including history, clinical presentation, chest radiograph findings when available, treatment, and outcome. Data were gathered separately from hospital-based and community-based cases. We performed a narrative synthesis to describe the final data set.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-one separate data sets were included in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) database, 26 of which were hospital-based and 15 were community-based. The PREPARE database includes 285 839 children with pneumonia (244 323 in the hospital and 41 516 in the community), with detailed descriptions of clinical presentation, clinical progression, and outcome. Of 9185 pneumonia-related deaths, 6836 (74%) occurred in children <1 year of age and 1317 (14%) in children aged 1-2 years.

36675137.0,Mining TCGA Database for Genes with Prognostic Value in Breast Cancer.,"The aim of the study was to use transcriptomics data to identify genes associated with advanced/aggressive breast cancer and their effect on survival outcomes. We used the publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to obtain RNA sequence data from patients with less than five years survival (Poor Prognosis, <i>n</i> = 101), patients with greater than five years survival (Good Prognosis, <i>n</i> = 200), as well as unpaired normal tissue data (normal, <i>n</i> = 105). The data analyses performed included differential expression between groups and selection of subsets of genes, gene ontology, cell enrichment analysis, and survival analyses. Gene ontology results showed significantly reduced enrichment in gene sets related to tumor immune microenvironment in Poor Prognosis and cell enrichment analysis confirmed significantly reduced numbers of macrophages M1, CD8 T cells, plasma cells and dendritic cells in samples in the Poor Prognosis samples compared with Good Prognosis. A subset of 742 genes derived from differential expression analysis as well as genes coding for immune checkpoint molecules was evaluated for their effect on overall survival.

The improved accuracy and granular treatment indicators of our database corrected for underestimations of the impact of hospital consolidation on hospital market power, yielding an effect estimate over 200% higher than the uncorrected data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By reducing errors in hospital M&A identification, our database can enhance the quality of studies investigating the effects of hospital consolidation on healthcare access and health outcomes.",bio-resource,0.8405005,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40355344,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.31009942,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
40432836.0,Updates on SPOP Gene Mutations in Prostate Cancer and Computational Insights From TCGA cBioPortal Database.,"Speckle-type pox virus and zinc finger protein (SPOP) has emerged as a key focus in prostate cancer research due to its critical role in regulating the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. This review aims to comprehensively summarize current knowledge on SPOP gene mutations in prostate cancer, emphasizing their importance in disease characterization and identification of therapeutic targets. A systematic literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. In addition, this study uses computational approaches and data from the TCGA cBioPortal database to explore the landscape of SPOP mutations in prostate cancer. After screening 682 articles and following systematic selection steps, 56 high-quality articles were included. Computational analysis of TCGA cBioPortal data revealed a SPOP mutation prevalence of 5%-6%, along with significant alterations in AR signaling and epigenetic regulation. SPOP mutations disrupt substrate recognition, leading to dysregulation of downstream pathways such as AR signaling and chromatin remodeling. Notably, SPOP-mutant prostate cancers are mutually exclusive with TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and enriched for Wnt pathway alterations. Patients with SPOP mutations demonstrate prolonged responses to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), although concurrent mutations in TP53 or DNA repair genes negatively impact outcomes. While their prognostic significance continues to evolve, their impact on the AR pathway highlights their potential as therapeutic targets. The clinical implications of SPOP mutations are substantial, as they are linked to variations in treatment response and disease progression, thus serving as valuable biomarkers for risk stratification and prognosis.",bio-resource,0.7412217,1,0,0.5294,0,1,40432836,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.3099414,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

We consulted VigiBase, a WHO database of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) which archives reports of suspected Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) when herbal products are used in conjunction with anti-cancer treatment. We focused on the possible interactions between antineoplastic (L01 ATC class) or hormone antagonists (L02B ATC class) with 10 commonly used herbs (pineapple, green tea, cannabis, black cohosh, turmeric, echinacea, St John's wort, milk thistle and ginger) to compare ADRs described in ICSRs with the literature. A total of 1057 ICSRs were extracted from the database but only 134 were complete enough (or did not concern too many therapeutic lines) to keep them for analysis. Finally, 51 rationalizable ICSRs could be explained, which led us to propose a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction mechanism. Reports concerned more frequently women and half of the rationalizable ICSRs involved Viscum album and Silybum marianum. 5% of the ADRs described could have been avoided if clinicians had had access to the published information. It is also important to note that in 8% of the cases, the ADRs observed were life threatening.

However, the genomic information and the biological knowledge related to the effect of thermal stress response are limited. This study generated the first de novo transcriptome assembly of the liver of G. maculatus and investigated the hepatic response to thermal stress in the G. maculatus. The de novo assembly resulted in 26,620 annotated transcripts, with an N50 of 2297, and a GC% of 49.76%. BUSCO analysis showed 97.1% and 75.7% complete orthologous (Metazoa and Actinopterygi, respectively). Functional annotation showed a total of 55,556 GO terms, with 26,128 annotations on biological process, 15,225 annotations on molecular functions, and 14,213 annotations on cellular component. The RNA-seq analysis revealed 94 differentially expressed transcripts in response to thermal stress, with 64 downregulated and 30 upregulated transcripts. The enrichment analysis showed biological processes related to double-strand break repair via homologous recombination, reciprocal meiotic recombination, and DNA repair. A significant increase in cortisol levels with no significant difference activity of hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, AP) due to thermal stress was observed. Also, an increase in DNA damage (AP sites formation) and lipid peroxidation (HNE protein adducts) in the liver due to thermal stress was observed.

35699913.0,"Repository Describing the Anatomical, Physiological, and Biological Changes in an Obese Population to Inform Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models.","<h4>Background</h4>Obesity is associated with physiological changes that can affect drug pharmacokinetics. Obese individuals are underrepresented in clinical trials, leading to a lack of evidence-based dosing recommendations for many drugs. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling can overcome this limitation but necessitates a detailed description of the population characteristics under investigation.<h4>Objective</h4>The purpose of this study was to develop and verify a repository of the current anatomical, physiological, and biological data of obese individuals, including population variability, to inform a PBPK framework.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was performed to collate anatomical, physiological, and biological parameters for obese individuals. Multiple regression analyses were used to derive mathematical equations describing the continuous effect of body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-60 kg/m<sup>2</sup> on system parameters.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 209 studies were included in the database. The literature reported mostly BMI-related changes in organ weight, whereas data on blood flow and biological parameters (i.e. enzyme abundance) were sparse, and hence physiologically plausible assumptions were made when needed. The developed obese population was implemented in Matlab<sup>®</sup> and the predicted system parameters obtained from 1000 virtual individuals were in agreement with observed data from an independent validation obese population. Our analysis indicates that a threefold increase in BMI, from 20 to 60 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, leads to an increase in cardiac output (50%), liver weight (100%), kidney weight (60%), both the kidney and liver absolute blood flows (50%), and in total adipose blood flow (160%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The developed repository provides an updated description of a population with a BMI from 18.5 to 60 kg/m<sup>2</sup> using continuous physiological changes and their variability for each system parameter.

39577955.0,Identification and anticoagulant mechanisms of novel factor XIa inhibitory peptides by virtual screening of a in silico generated deep-sea peptide database.,"The objective of this study was to identify novel anticoagulant peptides from the deep-sea using multiple in silico methods, and to investigate their inhibitory activity and molecular mechanisms. A deep-sea peptide database was firstly constructed by performing virtual proteolysis on protein sequences from animals inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Candidate anticoagulant peptides were identified through molecular docking and binding free energy screening against FXIa as the target. Two novel anticoagulant peptides, PRNIF (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.67 mM) and GNDRCL (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.52 mM), were identified, and their anticoagulant activities were verified in vitro. PRNIF was demonstrated to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of FXIa, and caused significant prolongation of thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), whereas GNDRCL markedly prolonged the APTT only. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated considerable conformational shifts of both anticoagulant peptides when bound to the active sites of FXIa. The lowest energy binding poses of the FXIa-peptide complexes for PRNIF and GNDRCL exhibited comparable numbers of hydrogen bonds and binding free energies. However, occupancy analysis revealed completely distinct stability characteristics of the hydrogen bond interactions. The conserved residue Asp569 in the S1 pocket of FXIa formed strong and stable hydrogen bonds as well as a salt bridge with the arginine residues of PRNIF, which were not observed in the FXIa-GNDRCL complex. To our knowledge, PRNIF represented the first FXIa inhibitory peptide derived from the deep-sea, which may contribute to the development and utilization of deep-sea peptides resources.

We posit design principles, present a unifying framework, and report a test of concept.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We structured a knowledge framework along 3 axes: condition of interest, knowledge source, and taxonomy. In our test of concept, we used hypertension as our condition of interest, literature and VanderbiltDDx knowledgebase as sources, and phecodes as our taxonomy. In a cohort of 832 566 deidentified EHRs, we modeled blood pressure and heart rate by sex and age, classified individuals by hypertensive status, and ran a Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) for hypertension. We compared the correlations from PheWAS to the associations in our knowledgebase.<h4>Results</h4>We produced PhecodeKbHtn: a knowledgebase comprising 167 hypertension-associated diseases, 15 of which were also negatively associated with blood pressure (pos+neg). Our hypertension PheWAS included 1914 phecodes, 129 of which were in the PhecodeKbHtn. Among the PheWAS association results, phecodes that were in PhecodeKbHtn had larger effect sizes compared with those phecodes not in the knowledgebase.<h4>Discussion</h4>Each source contributed unique and additive associations. Models of blood pressure and heart rate by age and sex were consistent with prior cohort studies. All but 4 PheWAS positive and negative correlations for phecodes in PhecodeKbHtn may be explained by knowledgebase associations, hypertensive cardiac complications, or causes of hypertension independently associated with hypotension.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is feasible to assemble a knowledgebase that is compatible with EHR data to aid interpretation of clinical correlation research.",bio-resource,0.64993507,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37164621,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.30633017,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

We analyzed the impact on the assay performances of the type of immunoassay, the number of measurements used to calculate the coefficient of variation (CVs), the nature and the autoantibody level of the internal quality control (IQC).<h4>Results</h4>Data were obtained from 64 laboratories from 15 European countries between February and October 2021. We analyzed 686 and 1,331 values of intra- and inter-run CVs, respectively. Both CVs were significantly dependent on: the method of immunoassay, the level of IQC with higher imprecision observed when the antibody levels were lower than 2-fold the threshold for positivity, and the nature of the IQC with commercial IQCs having lower CVs than patients-derived IQCs. Our analyses also show that the type of autoantibody has low impact on the assay' performances and that 15 measurements are sufficient to establish reliable intra- and inter-run variations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides for the first time an international repository yielding values of intra- and inter-run variation for quantitative autoantibody assays. These data could be useful for ISO 15189 accreditation requirements and will allow clinical diagnostic laboratories to assure quality of patient results.",bio-resource,0.930484,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35749077,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.30631578,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39726549.0,2021 JAPAN Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia Database (JCLIMB) Annual Report.,"Since 2013, the Japanese Society for Vascular Surgery has started the project of nationwide registration and tracking database for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who are treated by vascular surgeons. The purpose of this project is to clarify the current status of the medical practice for patients with CLI to contribute to the improvement of the quality of medical care. This database is created on the National Clinical Database (NCD) and collects data on patients' backgrounds, therapeutic measures, early results, and long-term prognoses as long as 5 years after the initial treatment. The name of this database was changed from the JAPAN Critical Limb Ischemia Database to the JAPAN Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia Database in 2021 because of the alteration of the definition of registered patients. The abbreviation remains JCLIMB. The limbs managed conservatively are also registered in JCLIMB, together with those treated by surgery and/or endovascular treatment (EVT). In 2021, 1338 CLTI limbs (male 916 limbs: 68%) were registered by 78 facilities. Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) has accounted for 99% of the pathogenesis of these limbs. In this manuscript, the background data and the early prognosis of the registered limbs of the ASO cohort are reported.

34990463.0,Analysis of coding variants in the human FTO gene from the gnomAD database.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron of the FTO gene reported in 2007 continue to be the known variants with the greatest effect on adiposity in different human populations. Coding variants in the FTO gene, on the other hand, have been little explored, although data from complete sequencing of the exomes of various populations are available in public databases and provide an excellent opportunity to investigate potential functional variants in FTO. In this context, this study aimed to track nonsynonymous variants in the exons of the FTO gene in different population groups employing the gnomAD database and analyze the potential functional impact of these variants on the FTO protein using five publicly available pathogenicity prediction programs. The findings revealed 345 rare mutations, of which 321 are missense (93%), 19 are stop gained (5.6%) and five mutations are located in the splice region (1.4%). Of these, 134 (38.8%) were classified as pathogenic, 144 (41.7%) as benign and 67 (19.5%) as unknown. The available data, however, suggest that these variants are probably not associated with BMI and obesity, but instead, with other diseases.

The phenotypic variability within the experimental unit determines the choice of the group size which is necessary for achieving valid and reproducible results. In this study, the variability of clinical chemical and hematological parameters which represent a comprehensive blood screen of laboratory mice, as well as of immunological parameters and behavioral tests was analyzed in data sets which have been submitted to the Mouse Phenome Database for mouse strains which are predominantly used in biomedical research. Most of the clinical chemical and hematological parameters-except of some parameters being known for their high variability-showed an average coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation / mean) below 0.25. Most immunological parameters measured in blood samples had a CV between 0.2 and 0.4. The behavioral tests showed a CV between 0.4 and 0.6, or higher. In addition, a large range of the CV was found for most parameters/tests between and within the selected projects.

FPIES is an allergic emergency due to severe vomiting occurring 1 to 4 hours after ingesting the causative food protein. Since the 2017 FPIES guidelines, no prospective data exist on the prevalence, incidence, and clinical characteristics of FPIES.<h4>Objective</h4>We established a multicenter FPIES registry to systematically collect clinical data and biospecimens on FPIES patients.<h4>Methods</h4>The FPIES registry is a US multicenter REDCap database collecting epidemiologic data to support the evolving FPIES landscape in relation to age at diagnosis, triggers and coreactivity, disease resolution, and risk of disease conversion to IgE allergy. Questionnaire and biosampling strategies have been developed using a systems biology approach to identify determinants of FPIES.<h4>Results</h4>The registry includes patients with physician diagnosis of FPIES (ICD-10 code K52.21) from January 2015. Longitudinal REDCap instruments for FPIES data collection include: age at first reaction, age at diagnosis, reaction timing, symptoms, treatment, medical care or hospitalization for reaction, dietary triggers, atopic comorbidities, family history of atopy and FPIES, oral food challenge procedures (eg, intravenous line placement, dosing protocol, observation period, reaction timing, symptoms and treatment), age at food trigger resolution, food-trigger IgE, cases converting from atypical FPIES to IgE-mediated food allergy, and sample collection data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The registry will provide a multicenter repository of data and biospecimens, enabling identification of clinical determinants and phenotypes of FPIES, better understanding of conversion risks, and identification of biomarkers and mechanisms associated with FPIES.",bio-resource,0.77288616,1,1,0.7466,1,1,40091881,0.5,impl_kw=1,False,False,False,1,0,0,0.30529916,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36362077.0,Blood Analytes as Biomarkers of Mechanisms Involved in Alzheimer's Disease Progression.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, but the pathogenetic factors are not yet well known, and the relationships between brain and systemic biochemical derangements and disease onset and progression are unclear. We aim to focus on blood biomarkers for an accurate prognosis of the disease. We used a dataset characterized by longitudinal findings collected over the past 10 years from 90 AD patients. The dataset included 277 observations (both clinical and biochemical ones, encompassing blood analytes encompassing routine profiles for different organs, together with immunoinflammatory and oxidative markers). Subjects were grouped into four severity classes according to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale: mild (CDR = 0.5 and CDR = 1), moderate (CDR = 2), severe (CDR = 3) and very severe (CDR = 4 and CDR = 5). Statistical models were used for the identification of potential blood markers of AD progression. Moreover, we employed the Pathfinder tool of the Reactome database to investigate the biological pathways in which the analytes of interest could be involved. Statistical results reveal an inverse significant relation between four analytes (high-density cholesterol, total cholesterol, iron and ferritin) with AD severity. In addition, the Reactome database suggests that such analytes could be involved in pathways that are altered in AD progression. Indeed, the identified blood markers include molecules that reflect the heterogeneous pathogenetic mechanisms of AD. The combination of such blood analytes might be an early indicator of AD progression and constitute useful therapeutic targets.",bio-resource,0.8049104,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36362077,-1.0,usage_kw=2,False,False,False,0,2,0,0.30496126,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Gastric cancer (GC) severely endangers public health. Despite satisfactory therapeutic effects achieved by using antitumor pCm to treat GC, its underlying mechanism remains unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>To integrate existing research data, construct a database of antitumor pCm, and study the intervention mechanisms in GC by focusing on their monomer components.<h4>Methods</h4>We constructed an antitumor pCm database based on China's medical insurance catalog, and employed network pharmacology, molecular docking methods, cell experiments, transcriptomics, and bioinformatics to investigate the intervention mechanisms of effective pCm components for GC.<h4>Results</h4>The study built an antitumor pCm database including 55 pCms, 171 Chinese herbal medicines, 1955 chemical components, 2104 targets, and 32 disease information. Network pharmacology and molecular docking technology identified norcantharidin as an effective component of antitumor pCm. In vitro experiments showed that norcantharidin effectively inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; blocked the G2/M cell cycle phase; and induced GC cell apoptosis. Transcriptomic results revealed that norcantharidin affected biological processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, and inflammatory responses by influencing PI3K-AKT, NF-κB, JAK-STAT, TNF-α signaling pathways, and EMT-related pathways. Core molecules of norcantharidin involved in GC intervention include SERPINE1, SHOX2, SOX4, PRDM1, TGFR3, TOX, PAX9, IL2RB, LAG3, and IL15RA. Additionally, the key target SERPINE1 was identified using bioinformatics methods.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Norcantharidin, as an effective component of anti-tumor pCm, exerts its therapeutic effects on GC by influencing biological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and inflammation.

The field of infant and early childhood neurodevelopment has made marginal advancements since introduced in 1988. There remains a gap in knowledge around early neurodevelopmental domains and trajectories given that there are few established assessment procedures for infants and young children and controversies around reserving assessments until school age. Throughout this systematic review, we (1) identified neurodevelopmental assessment measures employed in the literature by domain and age of assessment, (2) compiled a repository of 608 domain-specific neurodevelopmental assessment measures, and (3) established a preliminary conceptual framework for cross-domain neurodevelopmental assessments across infancy and early childhood. This review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and spanned three databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed). Articles were reviewed for (1) infancy and early childhood (0-6 years), (2) neurodevelopmental measures, and (3) English language. This systematic review spanned 795 articles from 1978 to 2020 with international representation. Advancements in assessment methods (e.g. measures, domains, frameworks) are essential for the evaluation of early neurodevelopmental profiles to inform early interventions, thus harnessing the neuroplasticity and dynamic development notable during early childhood.

The present study aims to validate the edited version of the Tromsø Infant Faces Database (E-TIF) in a large sample of participants. The original set of 119 pictures was edited. The pictures were cropped to remove nonrelevant information, fitted in an oval window, and converted to grayscale. Four hundred and eighty participants (72.9% women) took part in the study, rating the images on five dimensions: depicted emotion, clarity, intensity, valence, and genuineness. Valence scores were useful for discriminating between positive, negative, and neutral facial expressions. Results revealed that women were more accurate at recognizing emotions in children. Regarding parental status, parents, in comparison with nonparents, rated neutral expressions as more intense and genuine. They also rated sad, angry, disgusted, and fearful faces as less negative, and happy expressions as less positive.

36988391.0,A time- and space-resolved nuclear receptor atlas in mouse liver.,"The functional versatility of the liver is paramount for organismal homeostasis. Adult liver functions are controlled by a tightly regulated transcription factor network including nuclear receptors (NRs), which orchestrate many aspects of hepatic physiology. NRs are transcription factors sensitive to extracellular cues such as hormones, lipids, xenobiotics, etc. and are modulated by intracellular signaling pathways. While liver functional zonation and adaptability to fluctuating conditions rely on a sophisticated cellular architecture, a comprehensive knowledge of NR functions within liver cell populations is still lacking. As a step toward the accurate mapping of NR functions in the liver, we characterized their levels of expression in the whole liver from C57Bl6/J male mice as a function of time and diet. Nr1d1 (Rev-erba), Nr1d2 (Rev-erbb), Nr1c2 (Pparb/d), and Nr1f3 (Rorg) exhibited a robust cyclical expression in ad libitum-fed mice which was, like most cyclically expressed NRs, reinforced upon time-restricted feeding. In a few instances, cyclical expression was lost or gained as a function of the feeding regimen. NR isoform expression was explored in purified hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, and liver sinusoidal cells. The expression of some NR isoforms, such as Nr1h4 (Fxra) and Nr1b1 (Rara) isoforms, was markedly restricted to a few cell types.

40374964.0,Evaluation of Data Quality and Utility of the Japan Drug Information Institute in Pregnancy (JDIIP) Consultation Case Database for Pregnancy Pharmacovigilance.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Ensuring medication safety during pregnancy is crucial for protecting maternal and fetal health. However, fragmented data sources and the lack of comprehensive databases present substantial barriers to effective pharmacovigilance. The Japan Drug Information Institute in Pregnancy (JDIIP) database, which contains data on drug treatment counseling for pregnant women, is expected to help address the lack of comprehensive databases for pregnancy pharmacovigilance (PregPV).<h4>Objective</h4>We evaluated the quality and utility of the JDIIP database for PregPV activities, particularly its ability to consolidate and utilize drug-exposure data among pregnant women in Japan.<h4>Methods</h4>To assess the quality and utility of the JDIIP database for PregPV, we examined its alignment with 48 core data elements (CDEs) considered critical for PregPV, as recently proposed by a European Union consortium through the ConcePTION Project. We performed a detailed mapping of each CDE definition-including maternal lifestyle factors, drug exposure, and pregnancy outcomes-against the corresponding data elements captured in the JDIIP database.<h4>Results</h4>The JDIIP database either directly collected or could derive 38 of the 48 specific items (79%) recommended by the ConcePTION Project. At the category level, the JDIIP database aligned closely with the CDE requirements for database management details, pregnancy details, maternal medical history, pregnancy medication exposure, live/stillborn birth outcomes, and malformation details, achieving coverage of over 80% of the necessary variables in each category. Some categories, such as maternal medical conditions arising during pregnancy and infant complications within the first year of life, showed less alignment, with coverage rates below 50%. Although the JDIIP database provides comprehensive coverage of critical pharmacovigilance elements, data collection for specific variables and categories that better align with the CDE framework can be enhanced to improve alignment with the CDE framework and strengthen pharmacovigilance capabilities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings highlight the potential of the JDIIP database as a valuable resource for advancing PregPV research. Although the collection of certain maternal and infant data elements could be improved, the substantial alignment of the database with established CDEs positions it as a promising tool for advancing PregPV initiatives in Japan.",bio-resource,0.93032175,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40374964,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.29855114,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39819837.0,Evaluating the transcriptional regulators of arterial gene expression via a catalogue of characterized arterial enhancers.,"The establishment and growth of the arterial endothelium require the coordinated expression of numerous genes. However, regulation of this process is not yet fully understood. Here, we combined in silico analysis with transgenic mice and zebrafish models to characterize arterial-specific enhancers associated with eight key arterial identity genes (<i>Acvrl1</i>/<i>Alk1</i>, <i>Cxcr4, Cxcl12, Efnb2, Gja4/Cx37, Gja5/Cx40</i>, <i>Nrp1,</i> and <i>Unc5b</i>). Next, to elucidate the regulatory pathways upstream of arterial gene transcription, we investigated the transcription factors binding each arterial enhancer compared to a similar assessment of non-arterial endothelial enhancers. These results found that binding of SOXF and ETS factors was a common occurrence at both arterial and pan-endothelial enhancers, suggesting neither are sufficient to direct arterial specificity. Conversely, FOX motifs independent of ETS motifs were over-represented at arterial enhancers. Further, MEF2 and RBPJ binding was enriched but not ubiquitous at arterial enhancers, potentially linked to specific patterns of behaviour within the arterial endothelium. Lastly, there was no shared or arterial-specific signature for WNT-associated TCF/LEF, TGFβ/BMP-associated SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3, shear stress-associated KLF4, or venous-enriched NR2F2. This cohort of well-characterized and in vivo-verified enhancers can now provide a platform for future studies into the interaction of different transcriptional and signaling pathways with arterial gene expression.",bio-resource,0.94927603,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39819837,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.2984811,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37427090.0,"Characteristics of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension from an innovative, comprehensive real-world patient data repository.","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, life-limiting disease. PAH registries provide real-world data that complement clinical trial data and inform treatment decisions. The TRIO comprehensive, integrated patient data repository (TRIO CIPDR), is an innovative US repository capturing data on contemporary patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and receiving US Food and Drug Administration-approved PAH therapies. This repository uniquely combines clinical data from electronic medical records with the ability to track drug-prescription and drug-dispensing characteristics, and includes 946 adult patients with PAH (data collected January 2019 to December 2020) enrolled from nine representative US specialist tertiary care centers. Potentially eligible patients were identified based on dispensing data from specialty pharmacies. Hemodynamic and clinical data, as well as dispensing information on prescribed PAH medications, were provided by tertiary centers. At enrollment, 75% of patients were female, 67% were White, median age at PAH diagnosis was 53 years (median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 5 years), and 37% were obese. Comorbidity profiles were as expected for a PAH population, although the proportion with atrial fibrillation (34%) was higher than expected. Overall, 38% of patients had idiopathic PAH and 30% had connective tissue disease-related PAH. Among 917 patients receiving PAH-specific therapy, 40% were on monotherapy, 43% on dual therapy, and 17% on triple therapy.

36991458.0,DNA methylation and cardiovascular disease in humans: a systematic review and database of known CpG methylation sites.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and considered one of the most environmentally driven diseases. The role of DNA methylation in response to the individual exposure for the development and progression of CVD is still poorly understood and a synthesis of the evidence is lacking.<h4>Results</h4>A systematic review of articles examining measurements of DNA cytosine methylation in CVD was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines. The search yielded 5,563 articles from PubMed and CENTRAL databases. From 99 studies with a total of 87,827 individuals eligible for analysis, a database was created combining all CpG-, gene- and study-related information. It contains 74,580 unique CpG sites, of which 1452 CpG sites were mentioned in ≥ 2, and 441 CpG sites in ≥ 3 publications. Two sites were referenced in ≥ 6 publications: cg01656216 (near ZNF438) related to vascular disease and epigenetic age, and cg03636183 (near F2RL3) related to coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, smoking and air pollution. Of 19,127 mapped genes, 5,807 were reported in ≥ 2 studies. Most frequently reported were TEAD1 (TEA Domain Transcription Factor 1) and PTPRN2 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type N2) in association with outcomes ranging from vascular to cardiac disease. Gene set enrichment analysis of 4,532 overlapping genes revealed enrichment for Gene Ontology molecular function ""DNA-binding transcription activator activity"" (q = 1.65 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) and biological processes ""skeletal system development"" (q = 1.89 × 10<sup>-23</sup>). Gene enrichment demonstrated that general CVD-related terms are shared, while ""heart"" and ""vasculature"" specific genes have more disease-specific terms as PR interval for ""heart"" or platelet distribution width for ""vasculature."" STRING analysis revealed significant protein-protein interactions between the products of the differentially methylated genes (p = 0.003) suggesting that dysregulation of the protein interaction network could contribute to CVD. Overlaps with curated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database showed enrichment of genes in hemostasis (p = 2.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and atherosclerosis (p = 4.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This review highlights the current state of knowledge on significant relationship between DNA methylation and CVD in humans.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for the valuable prognostic biomarkers in HCC therapy. In this study, we aimed to screen hub genes correlated with prognosis of HCC via multiple databases. 117 HCC-related genes were obtained from the intersection of the four databases. We subsequently identify 10 hub genes (JUN, IL10, CD34, MTOR, PTGS2, PTPRC, SELE, CSF1, APOB, MUC1) from PPI network by Cytoscape software analysis. Significant differential expression of hub genes between HCC tissues and adjacent tissues were observed in UALCAN, HCCDB and HPA databases. These hub genes were significantly associated with immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoints. The hub genes were correlated with clinical parameters and survival probability of HCC patients. 147 potential targeted therapeutic drugs for HCC were identified through the DGIdb database. These hub genes could be used as novel prognostic biomarkers for HCC therapy.",bio-resource,0.7088486,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35637248,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.2971067,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38373162.0,An overview of actionable and potentially actionable TSC1 and TSC2 germline variants in an online Database.,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is caused by loss of function germline variants in the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor genes. Genetic testing for the detection of pathogenic variants in either TSC1 or TSC2 was implemented as a diagnostic criterion for TSC. However, TSC molecular diagnosis can be challenging due to the absence of variant hotspots and the high number of variants described. This review aimed to perform an overview of TSC1/2 variants submitted in the ClinVar database. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS), missense and single nucleotide variants were the most frequent in clinical significance (37-40%), molecular consequence (37%-39%) and variation type (82%-83%) categories in ClinVar in TSC1 and TSC2 variants, respectively. Frameshift and nonsense VUS have potential for pathogenic reclassification if further functional and segregation studies were performed. Indeed, there were few functional assays deposited in the database and literature. In addition, we did not observe hotspots for variation and many variants presented conflicting submissions regarding clinical significance. This study underscored the importance of disseminating molecular diagnostic results in a public database to render the information largely accessible and promote accurate diagnosis. We encourage the performance of functional studies evaluating the pathogenicity of TSC1/2 variants.",bio-resource,0.85252464,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38373162,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.2969277,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38099925.0,Expanding the Catalog of Patient and Caregiver Out-of-Pocket Costs: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Out-of-pocket (OOP) health care expenditures in the United States have increased significantly in the past 5 decades. Most research on OOP costs focuses on expenditures related to insurance and cost-sharing payments or on costs related to specific conditions or settings, and does not capture the full picture of the financial burden on patients and unpaid caregivers. The aim for this systematic literature review was to identify and categorize the multitude of OOP costs to patients and unpaid caregivers, aid in the development of a more comprehensive catalog of OOP costs, and highlight potential gaps in the literature. The authors found that OOP costs are multifarious and underestimated. Across 817 included articles, the authors identified 31 subcategories of OOP costs related to direct medical (eg, insurance premiums), direct nonmedical (eg, transportation), and indirect spending (eg, absenteeism). In addition, 42% of articles studied an expenditure that the authors did not label as ""OOP."" A holistic and comprehensive catalog of OOP costs can inform future research, interventions, and policies related to financial barriers to health care in the United States to ensure the full range of costs for patients and unpaid caregivers are acknowledged and addressed.",bio-resource,0.8697983,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38099925,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.29655877,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37370668.0,Novel Baseline Facial Muscle Database Using Statistical Shape Modeling and In Silico Trials toward Decision Support for Facial Rehabilitation.,"<b>Backgrounds and Objective</b>: Facial palsy is a complex pathophysiological condition affecting the personal and professional lives of the involved patients. Sudden muscle weakness or paralysis needs to be rehabilitated to recover a symmetric and expressive face. Computer-aided decision support systems for facial rehabilitation have been developed. However, there is a lack of facial muscle baseline data to evaluate the patient states and guide as well as optimize the rehabilitation strategy. In this present study, we aimed to develop a novel baseline facial muscle database (static and dynamic behaviors) using the coupling between statistical shape modeling and in-silico trial approaches. <b>Methods</b>: 10,000 virtual subjects (5000 males and 5000 females) were generated from a statistical shape modeling (SSM) head model. Skull and muscle networks were defined so that they statistically fit with the head shapes. Two standard mimics: smiling and kissing were generated. The muscle strains of the lengths in neutral and mimic positions were computed and recorded thanks to the muscle insertion and attachment points on the animated head and skull meshes. For validation, five head and skull meshes were reconstructed from the five computed tomography (CT) image sets. Skull and muscle networks were then predicted from the reconstructed head meshes. The predicted skull meshes were compared with the reconstructed skull meshes based on the mesh-to-mesh distance metrics. The predicted muscle lengths were also compared with those manually defined on the reconstructed head and skull meshes. Moreover, the computed muscle lengths and strains were compared with those in our previous studies and the literature. <b>Results</b>: The skull prediction's median deviations from the CT-based models were 2.2236 mm, 2.1371 mm, and 2.1277 mm for the skull shape, skull mesh, and muscle attachment point regions, respectively. The median deviation of the muscle lengths was 4.8940 mm. The computed muscle strains were compatible with the reported values in our previous Kinect-based method and the literature. <b>Conclusions</b>: The development of our novel facial muscle database opens new avenues to accurately evaluate the facial muscle states of facial palsy patients. Based on the evaluated results, specific types of facial mimic rehabilitation exercises can also be selected optimally to train the target muscles. In perspective, the database of the computed muscle lengths and strains will be integrated into our available clinical decision support system for automatically detecting malfunctioning muscles and proposing patient-specific rehabilitation serious games.",bio-resource,0.90164876,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37370668,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.29654133,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Previous studies have shown the value of combining large databases for research purposes. Our aim was to examine the feasibility and value of combining these databases on a local level.We included patients from both databases, cared for at our centre and born from 2015-2020, who had cardiac surgery as neonates or during the birth hospitalisation. We examined the number of patients from each database and overlap between the two. We compared cardiac diagnoses, surgeries performed, pre-operative factors, mortality, and length of stay between databases.Of the 255 patients meeting criteria, 209 (81.9%) had records in both databases. The most common diagnoses in both were hypoplastic left heart syndrome, coarctation, and transposition of the great arteries. Surgical data were incompletely recorded in Vermont Oxford. Gestational age, birth weight, multiple gestation, mortality, and length of stay did not differ significantly between the databases, while the percentage of patients with an extracardiac malformation or genetic syndrome recorded was higher in the Society for Thoracic Surgeons group.Larger-scale matching and comparison studies using these databases are feasible and desirable; for some variables, a record with data from both databases may be more complete. Specific attention should be given to inclusion criteria, reconciling different schema of diagnoses, and formulating questions relying on each database's relative strengths.",bio-resource,0.6540711,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35892172,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.29645276,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37190737.0,Standardized Database of 12-Lead Electrocardiograms with a Common Standard for the Promotion of Cardiovascular Research: KURIAS-ECG.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Electrocardiography (ECG)-based diagnosis by experts cannot maintain uniform quality because individual differences may occur. Previous public databases can be used for clinical studies, but there is no common standard that would allow databases to be combined. For this reason, it is difficult to conduct research that derives results by combining databases. Recent commercial ECG machines offer diagnoses similar to those of a physician. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to construct a standardized ECG database using computerized diagnoses.<h4>Methods</h4>The constructed database was standardized using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-common data model (OMOP-CDM), and data were then categorized into 10 groups based on the Minnesota classification. In addition, to extract high-quality waveforms, poor-quality ECGs were removed, and database bias was minimized by extracting at least 2,000 cases for each group. To check database quality, the difference in baseline displacement according to whether poor ECGs were removed was analyzed, and the usefulness of the database was verified with seven classification models using waveforms.<h4>Results</h4>The standardized KURIAS-ECG database consists of high-quality ECGs from 13,862 patients, with about 20,000 data points, making it possible to obtain more than 2,000 for each Minnesota classification. An artificial intelligence classification model using the data extracted through SNOMED-CT showed an average accuracy of 88.03%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The KURIAS-ECG database contains standardized ECG data extracted from various machines. The proposed protocol should promote cardiovascular disease research using big data and artificial intelligence.",bio-resource,0.75802016,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37190737,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.29640642,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

A well-designed IBD database is crucial for both epidemiological studies and clinical management. However, inconsistencies between regional databases hinder cross-institutional and international research, especially between Eastern and Western societies.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed a new IBD database, the 301 IBD database, integrating the IBD clinical characteristics from the Penn IBD database (USA) and the latest IBD guidelines and consensus and clinical practices of the Chinese PLA General Hospital (PLAGH). We applied this database to analyze clinical data of IBD inpatients at PLAGH from 2008 to 2023.<h4>Results</h4>The 301 IBD database contains 490 items in 6 sections including demographic characteristics, personal history, clinical phenotype, disease activity, laboratory tests and examinations, and treatment. Features of the 301 IBD database include inpatient focus, biochemical indicators and opportunistic infection focus, and more about ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated complications. Single-center analysis revealed an increasing hospitalization trend, from 2.35% in 2008 to 3.94% in 2023. We found that the clinical characteristics of our UC inpatients are predominantly male (62.5%), extensive lesions (55.1%), low usage of biologics (4.1%), and a high incidence of UC-CRC (3.0%). The clinical characteristics of CD inpatients included male predominance (68.39%), early onset age (35.43 ± 14.75-year-old), and high rate of surgery (25.81%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The 301 IBD database, integrating Eastern and Western clinical data, provides a valuable tool for IBD clinical research.

36156381.0,The French FRACTURE database: A way to improve knowledge on management of children with very rare tumors.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Very rare pediatric tumors (VRTs), defined by an annual incidence ≤2 per million inhabitants, represent a heterogeneous group of cancers. Due to their extremely low incidence, knowledge on these tumors is scant. Since 2012, the French Very Rare Tumors Committee (FRACTURE) database has recorded clinical data about VRTs in France. This study aims: (a) to describe the tumors registered in the FRACTURE database; and (b) to compare these data with those registered in the French National Registry of Childhood Cancer (RNCE).<h4>Methods</h4>Data recorded in the FRACTURE database between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018 were analyzed. In addition, these data were compared with those of the RNCE database between 2012 and 2015 to evaluate the completeness of the documentation and understand any discrepancies.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 477 patients with VRTs were registered in the FRACTURE database, representing 97 histological types. Of the 14 most common tumors registered in the RNCE (772 patients), only 19% were also registered in the FRACTURE database. Total 39% of children and adolescent VRTs registered in the RNCE and/or FRACTURE database (323 of a total of 828 patients) were not treated in or linked to a specialized pediatric oncology unit.<h4>Conclusion</h4>VRTs represent many different heterogenous entities, which nevertheless account for 10% of all pediatric cancers diagnosed each year. Sustainability in the collection of these rare tumor cases is therefore important, and a regular systematic collaboration between the FRACTURE database and the RNCE register helps to provide a more exhaustive picture of these VRTs and allow research completeness for some peculiar groups of patients.",bio-resource,0.95210624,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36156381,0.0,title_pattern; usage_kw=2,False,True,False,0,2,0,0.29488403,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

To investigate the extent of this disproportionate representation of global populations concerning variants of significance to thrombosis and hemostasis, 845 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and around 34 genes associated with thrombosis and hemostasis and included in the commercial Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (PMRA) were evaluated, using gene frequencies in 3 African (Somali and Luhya in East Africa, and Yoruba in West Africa) and 14 non-African (admixed American, East Asian, European, South Asian, and sub-groups) populations. Among the populations studied, Europeans were observed to be the best represented population by the hemostatic SNPs included in the PMRA. The European population also presented the largest number of common pharmacogenetic and pathogenic hemostatic variants reported in the ClinVar database. The number of such variants decreased the farther the genetic distance a population was from Europeans, with Yoruba and East Asians presenting the least number of clinically significant hemostatic SNPs in ClinVar while also being the two genetically most distinct populations from Europeans among the populations compared. Current study shows the lopsided representation of global populations as regards to hemostatic genetic variants listed in different commercial SNP arrays, such as the PMRA, and reported in genetic databases while also underlining the importance of inclusion of non-European ethnolinguistic populations in genomics studies designed to discover variants of significance to bleeding and thrombotic disorders.",bio-resource,0.6751922,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35337356,-0.5,usage_kw=1,False,False,False,0,1,0,0.2946542,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39758135.0,Validation and Utility of Drug-Nutrient Interaction and Dietary Supplement Mechanistic Activity in the Natural Medicines Database.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The increasing use of dietary supplements by patients with cancer and other chronic diseases requires the systematized review of potential interactions between prescription drugs and nutrients from supplements by health care and clinical research teams. Dietary supplement interaction databases are positioned to fill a gap in quantifying potential risks for patients, although none have been assessed for reliability in data interpretation. The NatMed database, a source for comprehensive reports on mechanistic and safety data for dietary supplement ingredients, was evaluated for use in future investigations.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from NatMed were retrieved using licensed end points for ingredient monographs with drug-nutrient interactions with doxorubicin across five pharmacokinetic and metabolic pathways, and for ingredient monographs with antioxidant activity. Interactions between dietary supplements and doxorubicin treatment and antioxidant monographs were independently reviewed and characterized by clinical pharmacists. Cohen's K was used to measure interrater reliability and the degree of agreement between pharmacists.<h4>Results</h4>Three hundred fifteen potential interactions with doxorubicin (n = 115 monographs) and 455 other antioxidant ingredients were identified and reviewed by clinical pharmacists. There was substantial to near-perfect agreement for drug-nutrient interactions with doxorubicin (Cohen's K = 0.64-0.85) and for antioxidants (Cohen's K = 0.84). A small proportion of retrieved monographs were not validated by the clinical pharmacists for interactions with doxorubicin (n = 20 occurrences, 6.4%) or for antioxidant activity (n = 28, 6.2%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>A high degree of reliability in data on dietary supplement interactions with doxorubicin and mechanisms of action suggests NatMed may be a dependable source of data for future investigators.

This monogenic form of obesity has mainly been detected in patients from consanguineous families. Prevalence estimates for the general population using the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database reported a low frequency of leptin mutations. One in approximately 15 million individuals will be homozygous for a deleterious leptin variant. With the present study, we aimed to extend these findings utilizing the augmented Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v2.1.1 including more than 140,000 samples. In total, 68 non-synonymous and 7 loss-of-function leptin variants were deposited in gnomAD. By predicting functional implications with the help of in silico tools, like SIFT, PolyPhen2 and MutationTaster2021, the prevalence of hetero- and homozygosity for putatively pathogenic variants (n = 32; pathogenic prediction by at least two tools) in the leptin gene were calculated. Across all populations, the estimated prevalence for heterozygosity for functionally relevant variants was approximately 1:2,100 and 1:17,830,000 for homozygosity. This prevalence deviated between the individual populations. Accordingly, people from East Asia and individuals of mixed ethnicities ('Others') were at greater risk to carry a possibly damaging leptin variant. Generally, this study emphasises the scarcity of pathogenic leptin variants in the general population with varying prevalence for distinct study groups.",bio-resource,0.7497874,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36121795,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.2937125,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35438269.0,Comparative Analyses of Turkish Variome and Widely Used Genomic Variation Databases for the Evaluation of Rare Sequence Variants in Turkish Individuals: Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism as a Disease Model,"<h4>Objective</h4>With the increasing use of whole-exome sequencing, one of the challenges in identifying the causal allele for a Mendelian disease is the lack of availability of population-specific human genetic variation reference databases. The people of Turkey were not represented in GnomAD or other publicly available large databases until recently, when the first comprehensive genomic variation database, Turkish Variome (TRV), was published. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRV or other publicly available large genomic variation databases can reliably be used for rare disease variant evaluation in Turkish individuals.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty non-disease-causing, non-synonymous variants (minor allele frequencies >1%) were identified in 58 genes that are known to be associated with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism from a large Turkish patient cohort. The allelic frequencies of these variants were then compared with those in various public genomic variation databases, including TRV.<h4>Results</h4>Our cohort variants showed the highest correlations with those in the TRV, Iranome, and The Greater Middle East Variome, in decreasing order.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results suggest that the TRV is the appropriate database to use for rare genomic variant evaluations in the Turkish population. Our data also suggest that variomes from geographic neighborhoods may serve as substitute references for populations devoid of their own genomic variation databases.",bio-resource,0.83840686,1,1,0.7466,1,1,35438269,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.29333812,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The aim of the present work was to update the previously developed version of the Italian GF-FCDB and to apply it to a theoretical GF diet. The updated GF-FCDB includes the composition of 108 GF cereal-based foods, as sold, in terms of energy and macro- and micro-nutrients, imputed using food label information combined with the standard recipe approach. Three scenarios (i.e., refined, mixed, and wholegrain cereals) of the weekly guideline menu for the general Italian population were analyzed for energy and nutrient content in a theoretical dietary assessment using traditional gluten-containing (GC) foods and the corresponding GF substitutes. All GF menus were higher than the corresponding GC menus in polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid, and vitamin E. Zinc was lower in GF than in GC menus only in the wholegrain-cereal scenario. Thanks to the application of the updated GF-FCDB including a comprehensive list of micronutrients, we observed that it is possible for celiac disease patients to meet nutrient requirements by simply substituting GC with GF cereal-based products following recommendations for the general population.",bio-resource,0.96034414,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36235823,0.0,title_pattern; usage_kw=2,False,True,False,0,2,0,0.29325655,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39979631.0,Adverse Events Associated with Devices for Incisional Glaucoma Surgery Performed with Implants as Reported to the FDA MAUDE Database.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Incisional glaucoma surgery is indicated in advanced glaucoma or glaucoma refractory to less invasive therapies, and can be performed with implants to lower IOP including glaucoma drainage or filtration devices. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) represents the largest U.S. publicly-available repository of device-related incisional glaucoma surgery complications, enabling insight into complications experienced with incisional glaucoma surgery in real-world practice to develop a risk profile for the use of each device.<h4>Methods</h4>MAUDE database was searched between January-2012 and December-2021 for Brand Name: Ahmed ClearPath, Ahmed Glaucoma Valve, Baerveldt, Ex-PRESS, and Molteno. Reports were categorized by complication;when multiple were present, multiple categories were attributed. Reports with identical text and dates were counted as duplicate and excluded. Literature reports comparing multiple devices without clear device specification per complication were excluded.<h4>Results</h4>The search yielded 1538 reports, of which 1379 reports describing 2429 adverse events met inclusion criteria. The most common events for were hypotony/hypotony maculopathy (284), device-iris touch (282), device occlusion (213), elevated IOP (210), and device explanted due to possible exclusion (176). Delivery system failures occurred (166). Patients also experienced flat/shallow anterior chambers (147) and corneal edema/bullous keratopathy/endothelial cell count reduction/corneal decompensation/Descemet's membrane tears (128).<h4>Conclusion</h4>By drawing on the real-world complications collected in the MAUDE database, this study identifies adverse events of greatest clinical pertinence for device-related incisional glaucoma surgery overall and by brand.

39636577.0,Management of individuals with heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in ATM: A clinical practice resource of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG).,"<h4>Purpose</h4>ATM germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) are associated with a moderately increased risk of female breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. Resources for managing ATM heterozygotes in clinical practice are limited.<h4>Methods</h4>An international workgroup developed a clinical practice resource to guide management of ATM heterozygotes using peer-reviewed publications and expert opinion.<h4>Results</h4>Although ATM is a moderate (intermediate) penetrance gene, cancer risks may be considered as a continuous variable, influenced by family history and other modifiers. ATM GPV heterozygotes should generally be offered enhanced breast surveillance according to their personalized risk estimate and country-specific guidelines and, generally, risk-reducing mastectomy is not recommended. Prostate cancer surveillance should be considered. Pancreatic cancer surveillance should be considered based on assessment of family history, ideally as part of a clinical trial, with existence of country-specific guidelines. For ATM GPV heterozygotes who develop cancer, radiation therapy decisions should not be influenced by the genetic result. Although poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors are licensed for use in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and ATM GPVs, the evidence-base is currently weak.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Systematic prospective data collection is needed to establish the spectrum of ATM-associated cancer and determine the outlines of surveillance, response to cancer treatment, and survival.",bio-resource,0.6102021,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39636577,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.2924331,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
41036315.0,"Introduction to the database ""efficacy of different treatment modalities for lower respiratory tract infections in children"".","This study aimed to establish a registry database of different treatment modalities for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in Chinese children, thereby filling gaps in knowledge on clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and rational drug use in relation to LRTIs in Chinese children, and providing large amounts of continuous, complete, scientific, and objective clinical data, and an information exchange platform. Multicenter data from these children's clinical visits were collected, pooled, and analyzed using medical informatics and statistical techniques to explore their potential value. The database was preliminarily established and a real-world study cohort was constructed based on a total of 4805 patients registered in this database. Pneumonia was identified as the most common type of LRTIs (72.44%), followed by acute bronchitis (20.71%). The mean age of the enrolled children with LRTIs was 3.26 ± 2.84 years, and boys accounted for 59.21% of the samples. Among the enrolled children, pneumonia and acute bronchitis had the highest incidence in children aged 1-3 years (27.44%) and those aged 3-6 years (34.16%), respectively. In this national, multicenter, observational database of LRTIs in children, the real-world characteristics and treatment modalities for LRTIs in Chinese children are elucidated.

40018115.0,Economic burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and post-tuberculosis sequelae in low- and middle-income countries: a database compiled from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tuberculosis (TB) impose a substantial economic burden globally. This systematic review summarised the evidence on the costs of COPD, including post-TB diseases in low- and middle-income countries.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review was conducted and studies published between 1 January 2013 and 28 March 2022 (the date of the search) were identified using various electronic databases without language restrictions. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened in duplicate and data were extracted and verified by reviewers. Eligible studies were categorised as cost analysis and/or economic burden studies, and costs were converted to 2021 United State dollar. Meta-analysis was conducted on the costs of hospitalisations, medication and outpatient visits.<h4>Results</h4>128 cost studies and 65 economic burden studies were included in this review. The data collected are presented in the Cost Database of COPD and Post-TB (CD-CPTB). The majority of studies were from Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, with a few from other middle-income countries. There were extremely limited data on the costs of post-TB sequelae and only a few studies were from Africa (n=6) and low-income (n=5) countries. The direct medical costs of COPD ranged from $26 per hospitalisation in India to $2694 per year per patient with severe disease in Mexico, while the costs of acute exacerbation of COPD ranged from $137 to $4207 per exacerbation with both the minimum and maximum costs occurring in Turkey. The costs were lower in lower middle-income countries compared with upper middle-income countries. Finally, considerable economic burden was attributable to smoking and air pollution.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The review and the CD-CPTB database give a thorough snapshot of the current evidence of the costs and economic burden of COPD and post-TB diseases. Future research is needed to investigate the economic impact after TB treatment and should be prioritised in Africa and low-income countries where there has been a lack of data collection.<h4>Protocol registration number</h4>CRD42022326609.",bio-resource,0.8637975,1,0,0.5867,0,1,40018115,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.29184312,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38460190.0,The ESTS-AIR database-initial results of a multi-institutional database on airway surgery.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Compared to lung resections, airway procedures are relatively rare in thoracic surgery. Despite this, a growing number of dedicated airway centres have formed throughout Europe. These centres are characterized by a close interdisciplinary collaboration and they often act as supra-regional referring centres. To date, most evidence of airway surgery comes from retrospective, single-centre analysis as there is a lack of large-scale, multi-institutional databases.<h4>Methods</h4>In 2018, an initiative was formed, which aimed to create an airway database within the framework of the ESTS database (ESTS-AIR). Five dedicated airway centres were asked to test the database in a pilot phase. A 1st descriptive analysis of ESTS-AIR was performed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 415 cases were included in the analysis. For adults, the most common indication for airway surgery was post-tracheostomy stenosis and idiopathic subglottic stenosis; in children, most resections/reconstructions had to be performed for post-intubation stenosis. Malignant indications required significantly longer resections [36.0 (21.4-50.6) mm] when compared to benign indications [26.6 (9.4-43.8) mm]. Length of hospital stay was 11.0 (4.1-17.3) days (adults) and 13.4 (7.6-19.6) days (children). Overall, the rates of complications were low with wound infections being reported as the most common morbidity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This evaluation of the 1st cases in the ESTS-AIR database allowed a large-scale analysis of the practice of airway surgery in dedicated European airway centres. It provides proof for the functionality of ESTS-AIR and sets the basis for rolling out the AIR subsection to all centres participating in the ESTS database.",bio-resource,0.97778165,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38460190,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.29180592,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37056295.0,Catalog of EQ-5D-3L Health-Related Quality-of-Life Scores for 199 Chronic Conditions and Health Risks in Denmark.,"<b>Background</b>. Assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are essential in estimating quality-adjusted life-years. It is sometimes not feasible to collect primary HRQoL data, and reliable secondary sources are necessary. Current ""off-the-shelf"" HRQoL catalogs are based on older diagnosis classifications and include a limited number of diseases. This article aims to provide 1) a Danish EQ-5D-3L-based HRQoL catalog for 199 nationally representative chronic conditions based on ICD-10 codes and 2) a complementary model-based catalog controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, lifestyle, and health risks. <b>Design</b>. A total of 55,616 respondents from 3 national health survey samples were pooled and combined with 7 national registers containing patient-level information on diagnoses, health care activity, and sociodemographics. EQ-5D-3L data were converted to utility scores using the Danish EQ-5D-3L value set to estimate the mean utility for each chronic disease population. Adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models were estimated and used to provide a regression-based catalog of utilities/disutilities. <b>Results</b>. Diseases with the lowest mean EQ-5D score in the Danish population were systemic sclerosis (M34; score = 0.432), fibromyalgia (M797; score = 0.490), rheumatism (M790; score = 0.515), dementia (F00, G30; score = 0.546), posttraumatic stress syndrome (F431; score = 0.557), and systemic atrophies (G10-G14; score = 0.583. Based on the estimated models, the largest estimated disutilities were cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, depression, dorsalgia, sclerosis, and fibromyalgia. Lifestyle factors, including perceived stress, loneliness, and body mass index, were also significantly associated with low HRQoL. <b>Conclusions</b>. This study provides a comprehensive nationally representative catalog and a model-based catalog of EQ-5D-3L-based HRQoL scores for Denmark that can be used to describe aspects of disease burden and allocate resources within health care. Additional Stata programs are also provided to facilitate predictions in other populations.<h4>Highlights</h4>A Danish national representative catalog of health-related quality-of-life scores for 199 chronic conditions is presented, which provides population estimates for chronic conditions subgroups that can be used for health economic evaluation.Two separate regression models of EQ-5D-3L utility scores with different sets of control variables are estimated to allow researchers to adjust for differences in the composition of the subgroups and provide a tool that can be used in other settings.Results indicate that health-related quality of life varies across disease groups but is lowest for renal disease, mental and behavioral disorders, benign neoplasms and diseases of the blood, digestive systems, and nervous systems.Health risks and lifestyle factors such as perceived stress, loneliness, and a large body mass index are highly correlated with health-related quality of life, and, in many cases, the correlation is higher than with individual diseases.",bio-resource,0.88130885,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37056295,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.29098868,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

This systematic MDSGene literature review comprehensively summarizes published demographic, clinical, and genetic findings related to LRRK2 variants ( https://www.mdsgene.org/ ). Data on 4660 individuals with 283 different variants were curated. The median age at onset in the PD patients with available information was 56 years, notably, with approximately one-third having PD onset <50 years. Tremor was the most frequently reported initial symptom and more common than reported in other dominantly inherited forms of PD. Of the 211 potentially PD-causing variants, 25 were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, and the remaining 186 (88.2%) were variants of uncertain significance. p.G2019S was the most frequently reported pathogenic variant, followed by p.R1441G and p.R1441C.

35748099.0,Queries on medication use during pregnancy: characterisation of the Swiss Teratogen Information Service database.,"<h4>Aims of the study</h4>Limited information on medication safety may result in concerns on how to treat pregnant and breast-feeding patients. The Swiss Teratogen Information Service (STIS) provides information to healthcare professionals about medications during pregnancy and breast feeding. Our objective was to describe the queries addressed to the STIS over the past two decades.<h4>Methods</h4>The STIS maintains a database of queries on pregnancy outcomes after exposure to various substances, which may be a valuable source of information. We initially analysed the general characteristics of all queries. Thereafter, we focused on exposure to medications during singleton pregnancies and associated health-related aspects.<h4>Results</h4>From 2000 to 2019, 7148 queries were entered into the database. An increasing number of queries was recorded over the study period, with an average of 357 queries entered into the database per year. Most of the enquirers were physicians; more specifically, gynaecologists/obstetricians (2389/7148; 33.4%) and psychiatrists (1007/7148; 14.1%). Two thirds (4747/7148; 66.4%) of the queries addressed medication intake during pregnancy; the next most frequent queries concerned planned medication in the context of pregnancy (928/7148; 13.0%) or medication use during breast-feeding (873/7148; 12.2%). In more than 50% (3611/7148) of cases, women were treated with more than one drug; altogether, 15193 medications (taken alone or in combination) were identified. The most frequent queries concerned medicines for the nervous system (ATC group N, n = 7042), with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 1271) in the leading position, followed by benzodiazepine derivatives (n = 1102) and other antidepressants (n = 780). The next most frequently mentioned drug classes were anti-infectives for systemic use (J, n = 1586) and drugs for the alimentary tract and metabolism (A, n = 1205). Analysis of follow-up information on cases of medication exposure during singleton pregnancies (n = 2672) revealed an offspring malformation rate of 4.2%. The organ system most often affected was the musculoskeletal system, followed by the circulatory system; congenital malformations of the nervous system and chromosomal abnormalities were also seen. The three most frequently documented congenital diagnoses were malformations of cardiac septa, the brain and major arteries.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Healthcare professionals often have concerns regarding the treatment of pregnant women with medication, and require professional counselling in this area. A variety of drugs are mentioned in queries addressed to the STIS, of which psycholeptics and psychoanaleptics are the most frequent. Proper guidelines on their use during pregnancy appear particularly urgent.",bio-resource,0.8090699,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35748099,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.289988,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37561120.0,Comparison between endocrine activity assessed using ToxCast/Tox21 database and human plasma concentration of sunscreen active ingredients/UV filters.,"Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans.",bio-resource,0.9783447,1,0,0.586,0,1,37561120,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.28978804,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36155382.0,A literature review and database of how the primary KIT/PDGFRA variant of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour predicts for sensitivity to imatinib.,"It is well recognized that the primary KIT or PDGFRA variant of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) can predict sensitivity to imatinib. However, these data are currently spread across a wide range of publications and have not been collated as one reference. A broad-ranging literature search was therefore performed to assemble such a database which should help optimize imatinib-based management of GIST patients henceforth. Having excluded wild type GISTs and results for imatinib used as adjuvant therapy, 79 publications (dated August 2001 to March 2022) underwent data extraction. These data on imatinib sensitivity were either derived from in vitro studies, predicted by in silico analysis or based on in vivo clinical patient response. Data interpretation carried some caveats: there was a potential for replication of patient-derived data between older and new publications; only predicted protein sequences were presented; the criteria used to record clinical response were not uniform across all publications; and imatinib dosage could vary between different clinical publications. However, these data showed broad agreement of imatinib sensitivity amongst similar subtypes of KIT or PDGFRA variant. There was also agreement between in vivo versus in vitro/in silico derived sensitivity data for most variants when both data types were available.",bio-resource,0.9866666,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36155382,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.2896293,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39466768.0,The TB vaccine clinical trial centre directory: An inventory of clinical trial centres in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"<h4>Background</h4>There are over ten vaccine candidates for tuberculosis (TB) in the clinical pipeline that require testing in TB-prevalent populations. To accelerate the clinical development of TB vaccines, a directory of clinical trial centres was established in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to assess capacity for conducting late-stage TB vaccine trials.<h4>Methods</h4>TB vaccine-related parameters were identified, and trial centres in SSA were identified and prioritized based on whether they had experience with TB or non-TB vaccine trials. A survey was sent to identified centres, and the resulting directory presents their capacity for TB vaccine trials. Centres that identified as eligible for TB vaccine trials also had the opportunity to participate to the survey. This article provides an overview of the TB vaccine clinical trial centre directory, including the number and distribution of centres, their general characteristics, and their experience with prior TB vaccine trials. It includes information on the capacity of the centres, such as laboratory biosafety level, patient support, and community engagement. It also includes a case study to demonstrate how the directory can be used to identify trial centres with specific capabilities needed for a particular TB vaccine trial.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 134 identified centres, 56 provided information. Of these centres, 51 (91%) had phase 3 clinical trial experience and previous TB trials were conducted at 38 centres. Regarding TB vaccine trials, 19 centres conducted prevention of disease trials, 14 conducted prevention of infection trials, and 27 had no experience with TB vaccine clinical trials. From the respondents, 29 centers in South Africa were identified that could potentially conduct TB vaccine trials, followed by Tanzania (5), Kenya (5), Nigeria (3), and Uganda and Ethiopia (2 each). Trial sites in other countries were underrepresented, based on this survey.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The establishment of a clinical trial centre directory can provide a basis for decision-making by various stakeholders. Despite some limitations in survey methodology, the findings suggest opportunities for expanding the evaluation of clinical trial capacity in other disease-prevalent countries and continents. Such data would be valuable in further enriching the Clinical Trial Community which a resource that geographically highlights clinical trial investments and capacities in African research ecosystem.<h4>Summary points</h4>New TB vaccine candidates need to be assessed in clinical trials in countries with high rates of TB in the coming years.An open-access directory of TB vaccine clinical trial centres in sub-Saharan Africa was established, providing an overview of the capacity to conduct clinical trials for TB vaccine candidates (http://www.edctp.org/our-work/coordination-tb-vaccine-funded-research/directory-tb-vaccine-clinical-trial-sites-sub-saharan-africa/).The directory is intended for clinical triallists, funders, policymakers, and researchers to accelerate the clinical development of novel TB vaccines by providing useful information.Regular updates are necessary to ensure the directory remains relevant for vaccine development and feeds into the continental Clinical Trials Community (https://ctc.africa/).",bio-resource,0.5181071,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39466768,1.0,has_url,False,False,True,0,0,0,0.28957185,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

After obtaining consent from all six groups, data were collected from August 2019 to June 2021.<h4>Results</h4>A total of eight trials, JCOG9812, JCOG0301, NJLCG0601, OLCSG0007, WJTOG0105, WJOG5008L, SPECTRA, and TORG1018, were included. More than 3000 data items were integrated into 408 items by adjusting their definitions and units. The total number of collected cases was 1288: median age (range), 66 (30-93) years; sex (male/female) 1064/224; pathological type (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, other NSCLC, and unknown) 517, 629, 138, and 4; and stage IIIA and B, 536 and 752. The median overall survival was 26.0 months, with 2-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates of 53.7%, 24.8%, and 15.2%, respectively, in all enrollments. The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months, with 2-, 5-, and 10-year progression-free survival rates of 23.6%, 14.0%, and 9.4%, respectively. Part of the information in the database has been made available on the JLCS web page, and the JLCS members were provided the right to propose research using the database.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The integration and sharing of clinical trial data for research purposes was made real by the nonprofit, academic organization, the JLCS.

Hence, we are uniquely poised to address several questions: What proportion of ET cases has Lewy pathology (LP)? What is the nature of that pathology and how does it relate to other comorbidities? Each brain had a complete neuropathological assessment, including α-synuclein immunostaining. We created a 10-category classification scheme to fully encapsulate the patterns of LP observed. Four metrics of cerebellar pathology were also quantified. Mean age at death = 89.0 ± 6.4 years. Fifty-eight (25.1%) had LP and 46 (19.9%) had early to late stages of Parkinson disease (PD). LP was very heterogeneous. Of 58 cases with LP, 14 (24.1%) clinically developed possible PD or PD after a latency of 5 or more years. There was a similar degree of cerebellar pathology in ET cases both with and without LP. In summary, 1 in 4 ET cases had LP-a proportion that seems higher than expected based on studies among control populations. Heterogeneous LP likely reflects clinical associations between ET and PD, and ET with Alzheimer disease-type neuropathology. These data further our understanding of ET and its relatedness to other degenerative diseases.",bio-resource,0.7529631,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35950950,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28817293,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37458718.0,A voluntary transfusion recipient registry in Korea as a database for blood group antibodies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Several types of transfusion-related registries have been developed to improve patient outcomes and blood banks. In Korea, a transfusion program functioning as a blood group antibody database and a reference laboratory has been in operation since July 2013. This study was conducted to determine the current status of blood group antigens and antibodies in Korea and propose a model for registries in the field of transfusion medicine.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Cases with unexpected red cell antibodies were registered online in the voluntary transfusion registry. Specific antigen-negative frequencies were calculated based on the recorded data. To determine the frequencies of RhCE antigens, data added via the Blood Information Sharing System were also analyzed. Data added to the registries between July 2013 and June 2022 were included in the analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Among 9,048 antibody cases registered from 29 hospitals, anti-E alone was identified most commonly, followed by anti-E and c, anti-C and e, anti-Lea, and anti-M (2,202, 1,792, 757, 618, and 383 cases, respectively). The frequencies of E-, E-c-, C-e-, Le(a-), and M- were 49.1%, 41.6%, 9.1%, 69.4%, and 21.8%, respectively.<h4>Discussion</h4>The distributions of antibodies and antigen frequencies were estimated through the transfusion registry. Antigen frequencies were calculated based on the results of antigen typing of red blood cell components performed at the time of issuing. The online transfusion registry serving as a blood group antibody database is useful for determining the frequencies of blood group antigens and antibodies.",bio-resource,0.7525631,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37458718,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28794792,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37029990.0,CRCBaSe: a Swedish register-based resource for colorectal adenocarcinoma research.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To facilitate high-quality register-based research on colorectal cancer (CRC) in Sweden by constructing a database consisting of CRC patients, matched comparators, and relatives.<h4>Material and methods</h4>Patients with adenocarcinoma in the colon and/or rectum were identified in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Register, a nationwide quality-of-care register. For each patient, six comparators from the general population were matched on birth year, sex, year of CRC diagnosis, and county. Comparators were free from CRC at the time of matching, but could later become cases. For both patients and comparators, first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) were identified. Information from nationwide population-based registers was retrieved and linked to each individual in the database using the personal identification number unique to all Swedish residents.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 76,831 CRC patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2016 were identified (51% colon, 49% rectal; before 2007 only rectal cancer patients were included). Among all patients, 37% were stage I-II, 22% stage III, and 22% stage IV. The median follow-up time was 11.9 years (inter-quartile range, IQR: 8.6-15.3). Together with comparators and relatives, the database contains 2,413,139 individuals with information on demographics, dates and causes of death, in- and outpatient healthcare records, cancer diagnoses, prescribed and dispensed drugs, childbirths (among women), and social security information (such as sick leave and early retirement).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Colorectal Cancer Database Sweden (CRCBaSe) is a large and unique register-based data research platform, which opens up for clinically important, large epidemiological studies with innovative design in the field of colorectal adenocarcinoma.",bio-resource,0.85487926,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37029990,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28768268,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37787257.0,Sarcomeric gene variants among Indians with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A scoping review.,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic heart muscle disease that frequently causes sudden cardiac death (SCD) among young adults. Several pathogenic mutations in genes encoding the cardiac sarcomere have been identified as diagnostic factors for HCM and proposed as prognostic markers for SCD. The objective of this review was to determine the scope of available literature on the variants encoding sarcomere proteins associated with SCD reported among Indian patients with HCM. The eligibility criteria for the scoping review included full text articles that reported the results of genetic screening for sarcomeric gene mutations in HCM patients of Indian south Asian ancestry. We systematically reviewed studies from the databases of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science core collection and Google Scholar. The electronic search strategy included a combination of generic terms related to genetics, disease and population. The protocol of the study was registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/53gde/). A total of 19 articles were identified that reported pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants within MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3 and TPM1 genes, that included 16 singletons, one de novo and one digenic mutation (MYH7/ TPM1) associated with SCD among Indian patients. Evidence from functional studies and familial segregation implied a plausible mechanistic role of these P/LP variants in HCM pathology. This scoping review has compiled all the P/LP variants reported to-date among Indian patients and summarized their association with SCD. Single homozygous, de novo and digenic mutations were observed to be associated with severe phenotypes compared to single heterozygous mutations. The abstracted genetic information was updated with reference sequence ID (rsIDs) and compiled into freely accessible HCMvar database, available at https://hcmvar.heartfailure.org.in/. This can be used as a population specific genetic database for reference by clinicians and researchers involved in the identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers for HCM.",bio-resource,0.63814443,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37787257,1.5,has_url; impl_kw=1,False,False,True,1,0,0,0.28740835,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39687301.0,Cardiovascular toxicity risk assessment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors: a pharmacovigilance study using the VigiBase database.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Advances in the early detection and treatment of cancer have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with cancer. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective targeted treatments for various malignancies that act by inhibiting kinase activity. Although these drugs share a common mechanism of action, they differ in their targeted kinases, pharmacokinetics, and side effects. TKIs can cause cardiovascular side effects, which adversely affect the prognosis of cancer survivors. This study aimed to assess the risk of cardiac toxicity associated with TKIs using the World Health Organization Global Database, VigiBase.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from VigiBase, a comprehensive global database of suspected drug reactions. The dataset included reports up to December 2022. We identified patients treated with Food and Drug Administration-approved TKIs and analyzed their age and sex data. The primary outcome was cardiovascular impairment, defined by 21 preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology version 25.1. Disproportionality analysis using the reported odds ratio was performed to detect adverse cardiovascular signals. Statistical analyses were conducted using R 3.3.2, with a P-value <0.05 considered significant.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 32, 520, 983 reports in VigiBase, 23, 181, 539 were eligible for the analysis. Significant cardiovascular signals were identified for 17 TKIs, including erlotinib, gefitinib, and imatinib. Stratified analyses revealed potential sex- and age-related differences in the risk of adverse events. Heatmaps indicated significant signals for drugs such as lapatinib in males and gefitinib in younger patients.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our findings indicate that some TKIs, particularly those classified as VEGFR, BCR-ABL, and BTK, pose similar risks of cardiotoxicity, while others, including EGFR, HER2, and ALK TKIs, exhibit varied risk profiles. These results underscore the importance of individualized risk assessment and management of TKI-treated patients. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the cardiotoxic risk of TKIs, which is essential for developing tailored treatment plans.",bio-resource,0.5174442,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39687301,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.28681186,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39243825.0,Do longer duration nonclinical toxicology studies provide predictive clinical safety value? The IQ consortium longer duration nonclinical to clinical translational database.,"The IQ Consortium's DruSafe Leadership Group previously reported results of a nonclinical to clinical translational database for First-In-Human (FIH)-enabling animal toxicology studies. We have completed an additional translational database populated with longer duration (>1 month) animal toxicology studies and longer duration (Phase 2 and beyond) clinical trials. The blinded database was composed of 127 molecules. Animal and clinical data were categorized by organ system and animal model (e.g. rodent, dog). The 2 × 2 contingency table (true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative) was used for statistical analysis and both the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. As also reported in the FIH database, the NPV was the strongest predictive performance measure at 96 %. The PPV was lower than the FIH database with the rodent at 29 %, dog at 21 % and NHP at 20 %. No new additional target organs were observed in 62 % of the entries. A new target organ was identified in 38 % of the entries, with the majority in a rodent (26 %) and fewer in the dog (8 %) or NHP (12 %). However, new target organ data resulted in only a PPV of 13 %, suggesting that current ICH requirements for longer duration animal general toxicology studies should be re-evaluated and better aligned with the 3Rs. A newer paradigm could include an appropriately justified single animal model for longer duration studies, in addition to utilizing New Approach Methods (NAMs) that would provide translational safety data, but additional research is needed.",bio-resource,0.8929128,1,0,0.5866,0,1,39243825,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28666347,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

This study aimed to develop and apply a repository of currently published population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models of caffeine in preterm infants to facilitate model-informed precision dosing (MIPD).<h4>Research design and methods</h4>Literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Relevant publications were screened, and their quality was assessed. PopPK models were reestablished to develop the model repository. Covariate effects were evaluated and the concentration-time profiles were simulated. An online simulation and calculation tool was developed as an instance.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve PopPK models were finally included in the repository. Preterm infants' age and body size, especially the postnatal age and current weight, were identified as the most clinically critical covariates. Simulated blood concentration-time profiles across these models were comparable. Caffeine citrate-dose regimen should be adjusted according to the age and body size of preterm infants. The developed online tool can be used to facilitate clinical decision-making.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The first developed repository of PopPK models for caffeine in preterm infants has a wide range of potential applications in the MIPD of caffeine.",bio-resource,0.98065096,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39167118,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.28660685,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38500691.0,Model-Informed Precision Dosing of Isoniazid: Parametric Population Pharmacokinetics Model Repository.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Isoniazid (INH) is a crucial first-line anti tuberculosis (TB) drug used in adults and children. However, various factors can alter its pharmacokinetics (PK). This article aims to establish a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models repository of INH to facilitate clinical use.<h4>Methods</h4>A literature search was conducted until August 23, 2022, using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. We excluded published popPK studies that did not provide full model parameters or used a non-parametric method. Monte Carlo simulation works was based on RxODE. The popPK models repository was established using R. Non-compartment analysis was based on IQnca.<h4>Results</h4>Fourteen studies included in the repository, with eleven studies conducted in adults, three studies in children, one in pregnant women. Two-compartment with allometric scaling models were commonly used as structural models. NAT2 acetylator phenotype significantly affecting the apparent clearance (CL). Moreover, postmenstrual age (PMA) influenced the CL in pediatric patients. Monte Carlo simulation results showed that the geometric mean ratio (95% Confidence Interval, CI) of PK parameters in most studies were within the acceptable range (50.00-200.00%), pregnant patients showed a lower exposure. After a standard treatment strategy, there was a notable exposure reduction in the patients with the NAT2 RA or nonSA (IA/RA) phenotype, resulting in a 59.5% decrease in AUC<sub>0-24</sub> and 83.2% decrease in C<sub>max</sub> (Infants), and a 49.3% reduction in AUC<sub>0-24</sub> and 73.5% reduction in C<sub>max</sub> (Adults).<h4>Discussion</h4>Body weight and NAT2 acetylator phenotype are the most significant factors affecting the exposure of INH. PMA is a crucial factor in the pediatric population. Clinicians should consider these factors when implementing model-informed precision dosing of INH. The popPK model repository for INH will aid in optimizing treatment and enhancing patient outcomes.",bio-resource,0.9532111,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38500691,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.2866065,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35476961.0,"Adverse reactions following transfusion of blood components, with a focus on some rare reactions: Reports to the International Haemovigilance Network Database (ISTARE) in 2012-2016.","<h4>Objectives</h4>The International Haemovigilance Network's (IHN) ISTARE database collects surveillance data on all adverse reactions (AR) associated with transfusion of blood and blood components, facilitating the sharing of best practice and benchmarking for improving blood safety and quality. Up to 2012, no publications discussed certain rare AR. The aim of this study is to examine ISTARE data on AR from 2012 to 2016, focusing on hypotensive reactions, post-transfusion purpura (PTP), transfusion-associated graft versus host disease (TA-GvHD), hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>National Haemovigilance Systems (HVS), provided aggregate annual data on AR by type of reaction, severity, imputability to transfusion, and blood component implicated. Twenty-nine HVS provided 104 annual reports covering 107,778,290 blood units issued.<h4>Results</h4>Among AR reported, 25% were serious, including 368 deaths. The 284 transfusion-transmitted infections included 187 bacterial infections, 84 viral and 13 parasitic or fungal; nine deaths resulted. AR related to the respiratory system transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury and transfusion-associated dyspnoea accounted for 8.3% of all AR, 20.1% of serious, and 52.2% of deaths. Of 1634 rare AR, 1565 were hypotensive, 38 PTP, 17 GvHD, 9 hyperkalemia and 5 hypercalcemia. Half were serious and 16 fatalities were recorded (13 hypotensive, 2 GvHD, one PTP). Among 14 countries that reported any hypotensive AR, incidences diverged widely.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ARs in this group are frequently severe or life-threatening. Hypotensive AR are the most common, but may have been overlooked and counted under allergic and other AR presenting with hypotension. Compliance with the ISBT definition may be suboptimal, thus its real incidence may be higher. Data on GvHD may contribute to clarifying the role of leukodepletion with or without irradiation. ISTARE continues to be a useful surveillance tool for all transfusion AR and provides relevant insights into overlooked and rare AR, thus offering important contributions towards maximising transfusion safety.",bio-resource,0.66124624,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35476961,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28645855,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

For percutaneous tracheostomy, 38 (73%) events were related to device malfunction, and 14 (27%) were related to patient injury. The most frequently reported adverse events were cuff malfunction (29%), safety ridge malfunction (17%), and bleeding (10%).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The MAUDE database is a useful tool that can be utilized to complement existing literature in identifying common and rare adverse events associated with tracheostomy device-related failures, which are mostly reliant on isolated, published case reports.",bio-resource,0.6084734,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37622490,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28645232,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37285719.0,"COVID-19 in cancer patients: update from the joint analysis of the ESMO-CoCARE, BSMO, and PSMO international databases.","<h4>Background</h4>COVID-19 has significantly affected patients with cancer and revealed unanticipated challenges in securing optimal cancer care across different disciplines. The European Society for Medical Oncology COVID-19 and CAncer REgistry (ESMO-CoCARE) is an international, real-world database, collecting data on the natural history, management, and outcomes of patients with cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection.<h4>Methods</h4>This is the 2nd CoCARE analysis, jointly with Belgian (Belgian Society of Medical Oncology, BSMO) and Portuguese (Portuguese Society of Medical Oncology, PSMO) registries, with data from January 2020 to December 2021. The aim is to identify significant prognostic factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality (primary outcomes), as well as intensive care unit admission and overall survival (OS) (secondary outcomes). Subgroup analyses by pandemic phase and vaccination status were carried out.<h4>Results</h4>The cohort includes 3294 patients (CoCARE: 2049; BSMO: 928, all hospitalized by eligibility criteria; PSMO: 317), diagnosed in four distinct pandemic phases (January to May 2020: 36%; June to September 2020: 9%; October 2020 to February 2021: 41%; March to December 2021: 12%). COVID-19 hospitalization rate was 54% (CoCARE/PSMO), ICU admission 14%, and COVID-19 mortality 22% (all data). At a 6-month median follow-up, 1013 deaths were recorded with 73% 3-month OS rate. No significant change was observed in COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients across the four pandemic phases (30%-33%). Hospitalizations and ICU admission decreased significantly (from 78% to 34% and 16% to 10%, respectively). Among 1522 patients with known vaccination status at COVID-19 diagnosis, 70% were non-vaccinated, 24% had incomplete vaccination, and 7% complete vaccination. Complete vaccination had a protective effect on hospitalization (odds ratio = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [0.14-0.38]), ICU admission (odds ratio = 0.29 [0.09-0.94]), and OS (hazard ratio = 0.39 [0.20-0.76]). In multivariable analyses, COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with patient/cancer characteristics, the first pandemic phase, the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms or inflammatory biomarkers, whereas COVID-19 mortality was significantly higher in symptomatic patients, males, older age, ethnicity other than Asian/Caucasian, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2, body mass index <25, hematological malignancy, progressive disease versus no evident disease, and advanced cancer stage.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The updated CoCARE analysis, jointly with BSMO and PSMO, highlights factors that significantly affect COVID-19 outcomes, providing actionable clues for further reducing mortality.",bio-resource,0.5657688,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37285719,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.28629133,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Reports of the CRAEs in radiology started in September 2019 after the team registration phase.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 89 CRAEs reported, 28 (31%) were targeted as interventional radiology, 27 (30%) as linked to contrast media and 11 (12%) as related to MRI care; the 23 other CRAEs reported included five defaults in the transmission of requests or results, five delays in diagnosis or treatment, four patient-identity monitoring events, four diagnostic radiology complications, four radiation protection events and one patient information problem. The severity was rated as ""minor"" for 53% of CRAEs and as ""serious to critical"" or ""catastrophic"" for 8% and 9% of CRAEs, respectively. They were preventable or probably preventable in 84% of all events.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These early results of this nation-wide CRAEs declaration database show the diversity of all CRAEs and their causes in radiological practice in France, and provide a global vision of areas for improvement of the quality of care in radiology. This should convince other radiologists to declare CRAEs and allow, in time, the production of recommendations and patient safety solutions as to limit the risks associated with radiological care.",bio-resource,0.62001634,1,0,0.5867,0,1,35183484,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28549647,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
34889828.0,Adverse Events Associated With Ossicular Prostheses: Utility of a Federal Database.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Ossicular prostheses have demonstrated utility in ossicular chain reconstruction, but their use also is associated with complications. This study aims to explore the utility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for the systematic analysis of complications associated with ossicular prostheses. It also summarizes adverse events to patients (AEPs) and device malfunctions (DMs) reported in the MAUDE database, and attempts to examine the consequences brought about by these events and to identify likely root causes.<h4>Study design</h4>Retrospective analysis of the MAUDE database.<h4>Methods</h4>The MAUDE database was queried for reports from January 2010 to May 2020. Data were extracted from reports involving the use of ossicular prostheses.<h4>Results</h4>Seventy-three medical device reports, reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration detailing suspected device-associated malfunctions, injuries, and deaths, involved ossicular prostheses and were included for analysis, from which 126 adverse events were extracted. Of these, 50 (39.7%) were AEPs, while 76 (60.3%) were DMs. The most common AEPs were foreign body and hearing loss, while the DMs reported most commonly were broken prosthesis and displaced prosthesis. Of the 76 DMs, 19 (25%) were attributed to mishandling by the operator, while 6 (7.9%) were due to a defective device. Broken prosthesis was the DM most commonly attributed to mishandling by the operator in 16 (32.7%) cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ossicular prostheses are used extensively for ossicular chain reconstruction, but also are associated with adverse events. The MAUDE database in its current form does not appear sufficient for the systematic review of adverse events associated with ossicular prostheses.

We obtained genomic datasets of a comprehensive genomic profiling test, FoundationOne<sup>®</sup> CDx, with clinical information using the ""Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics"" (C-CAT) database in Japan. Patients can undergo the tests only after standardized treatments under universal health insurance coverage. Endometrial cancers were characterized by a high frequency of TMB-H and MSI-H, especially in endometrioid carcinomas. The lower ratio of <i>POLE</i> exonuclease mutations and the higher ratio of <i>TP53</i> mutations compared to previous reports suggested the prognostic effects of the molecular subtypes. Among the 839 cervical cancer samples, frequent mutations of <i>KRAS</i>, <i>TP53</i>, <i>PIK3CA</i>, <i>STK11</i>, <i>CDKN2A</i>, and <i>ERBB2</i> were observed in adenocarcinomas, whereas the ratio of TMB-H was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas. Among the 1606 ovarian cancer samples, genomic profiling of serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous carcinomas was characterized. Pathogenic mutations in the <i>POLE</i> exonuclease domain were associated with high TMB, and the mutation ratio was low in both cervical and ovarian cancers.

40747339.0,A Newly Launched Nationwide Database Revealed Real-World Evidence on Systemic Therapy for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Japan: Hepatoma Registry of Integrating and Aggregating Electronic Health Record (HERITAGE).,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>As systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rapidly advances, eight treatment regimens are currently approved in Japan. However, the limited settings of phase III clinical trials necessitate large-scale real-world data to evaluate effective treatment sequences. To address this, we established a nationwide registry called the Hepatoma Registry of Integrating and Aggregating Electronic Health Record (HERITAGE).<h4>Approach and results</h4>HERITAGE, associated with a nationwide follow-up survey by the Japan Liver Cancer Association, included cases where first-line systemic therapy commenced between April 2015 and December 2022. We collected data on treatment regimens, patient demographics, effectiveness, and duration and assessed changes in regimens, trends in patient characteristics, efficacy per regimen, and cross-resistance in combinations of first- and second-line treatments. The study enrolled over 8,000 treatment lines from 5,525 cases. Chronological analysis revealed a progression in first-line treatments from sorafenib to lenvatinib and then to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. These regimens were frequently reused in second and subsequent lines. There was an increase in older patients and those with nonviral etiologies and robust liver function.

37855659.0,The International Cardiac Arrest Research Consortium Electroencephalography Database.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To develop the International Cardiac Arrest Research (I-CARE), a harmonized multicenter clinical and electroencephalography database for acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injury research involving patients with cardiac arrest.<h4>Design</h4>Multicenter cohort, partly prospective and partly retrospective.<h4>Setting</h4>Seven academic or teaching hospitals from the United States and Europe.<h4>Patients</h4>Individuals 16 years old or older who were comatose after return of spontaneous circulation following a cardiac arrest who had continuous electroencephalography monitoring were included.<h4>Interventions</h4>Not applicable.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>Clinical and electroencephalography data were harmonized and stored in a common Waveform Database-compatible format. Automated spike frequency, background continuity, and artifact detection on electroencephalography were calculated with 10-second resolution and summarized hourly. Neurologic outcome was determined at 3-6 months using the best Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale. This database includes clinical data and 56,676 hours (3.9 terabytes) of continuous electroencephalography data for 1,020 patients. Most patients died ( n = 603, 59%), 48 (5%) had severe neurologic disability (CPC 3 or 4), and 369 (36%) had good functional recovery (CPC 1-2). There is significant variability in mean electroencephalography recording duration depending on the neurologic outcome (range, 53-102 hr for CPC 1 and CPC 4, respectively). Epileptiform activity averaging 1 Hz or more in frequency for at least 1 hour was seen in 258 patients (25%) (19% for CPC 1-2 and 29% for CPC 3-5). Burst suppression was observed for at least 1 hour in 207 (56%) and 635 (97%) patients with CPC 1-2 and CPC 3-5, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The I-CARE consortium electroencephalography database provides a comprehensive real-world clinical and electroencephalography dataset for neurophysiology research of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. This dataset covers the spectrum of abnormal electroencephalography patterns after cardiac arrest, including epileptiform patterns and those in the ictal-interictal continuum.",bio-resource,0.98952943,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37855659,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28262922,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39061237.0,Collection of Rare Peripheral Nerve Tumors-Insights from the German Registry.,"The most common peripheral nerve tumors are of a benign nature and include schwannoma or neurofibroma. In rare cases, other tumors or non-tumorous lesions can mimic peripheral nerve tumors clinically or radiologically. Based on data from the multicentric German Peripheral Nerve Tumor Registry (PNTR), which encompasses current information on 315 surgically treated patients from three high-volume centers, we present 61 cases of rare tumors and lesions that mimic tumors associated with peripheral nerves. This cohort displays considerable heterogeneity, featuring a broad spectrum of morphological features and biological potentials. Histopathological diagnoses include various intrinsic peripheral nerve tumors such as malignant peripheral nerve tumors (MPNSTs) (<i>n</i> = 13), perineurioma (<i>n</i> = 17), and hybrid nerve sheath tumors (HPNSTs, comprising schwannoma/perineurioma and schwannoma/neurofibroma) (<i>n</i> = 14), as well as atypical neurofibromatous neoplasm with unknown biological potential (ANNUBP) (<i>n</i> = 1). Additionally, the cohort encompasses extrinsic tumorous lesions like lymphoma (<i>n</i> = 3), lymphangioma (<i>n</i> = 2), hemangioma (<i>n</i> = 2), solitary fibrous tumor (<i>n</i> = 2), metastatic disease (<i>n</i> = 1), and single cases of other rare tumor entities (<i>n</i> = 6). An overview of the underlying pathology, imaging features, and clinical presentation is provided, with a brief description of each entity. A definitive preoperative differentiation between benign peripheral nerve tumors and rare intrinsic and extrinsic tumors is often not possible. Clinical examination and subtle imaging clues can at least indicate the possibility of a rare entity. The basic requirement is close cooperation between radiologists, neurologists, neuropathologists, and neurosurgeons at a specialized center to develop a multidisciplinary concept and offer the patient the best therapeutic approaches.",bio-resource,0.5127121,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39061237,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.2824719,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37747225.0,"Consensus-Based Development of a Global Registry for Traumatic Brain Injury: Establishment, Protocol, and Implementation.","<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Global disparity exists in the demographics, pathology, management, and outcomes of surgically treated traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the factors underlying these differences, including intervention effectiveness, remain unclear. Establishing a more accurate global picture of the burden of TBI represents a challenging task requiring systematic and ongoing data collection of patients with TBI across all management modalities. The objective of this study was to establish a global registry that would enable local service benchmarking against a global standard, identification of unmet need in TBI management, and its evidence-based prioritization in policymaking.<h4>Methods</h4>The registry was developed in an iterative consensus-based manner by a panel of neurotrauma professionals. Proposed registry objectives, structure, and data points were established in 2 international multidisciplinary neurotrauma meetings, after which a survey consisting of the same data points was circulated within the global neurotrauma community. The survey results were disseminated in a final meeting to reach a consensus on the most pertinent registry variables.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 156 professionals from 53 countries, including both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries, responded to the survey. The final consensus-based registry includes patients with TBI who required neurosurgical admission, a neurosurgical procedure, or a critical care admission. The data set comprised clinically pertinent information on demographics, injury characteristics, imaging, treatments, and short-term outcomes. Based on the consensus, the Global Epidemiology and Outcomes following Traumatic Brain Injury (GEO-TBI) registry was established.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The GEO-TBI registry will enable high-quality data collection, clinical auditing, and research activity, and it is supported by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and the National Institute of Health Research Global Health Program. The GEO-TBI registry ( https://geotbi.org ) is now open for participant site recruitment.

40075838.0,Is the Transverse Colon Overlooked? Establishing a Comprehensive Colonoscopy Database from a Multicenter Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.,"<b>Background and Study Aim:</b> Colonoscopy holds the highest volume of all endoscopic procedures, allowing for large colonoscopy databases to serve as valuable datasets for quality assurance. We aimed to build a comprehensive colonoscopy database for quality assurance and the training of future AIs. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> As part of a cluster-randomized controlled trial, a designated, onsite medical student was used to acquire procedural and patient-specific data, ensuring a high level of data integrity. The following data were thereby collected for all colonoscopies: full colonoscopy vides, colonoscope position (XYZ-coordinates), intraprocedural timestamps, pathological report, endoscopist description, endoscopist planning, and patient-reported discomfort. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1447 patients were included from the 1st of February 2022 to the 21st of November 2023; 1191 colonoscopies were registered as completed, 88 were stopped due to inadequate bowel cleansing, and 41 were stopped due to patient discomfort. Of the 1191 completed colonoscopies, 601 contained polypectomies (50.4%), and 590 did not (49.6%). Comparing colonoscopies with polypectomies to those without the withdrawal time (caecum to extubating the scope) was significantly longer for all parts of the colon (<i>p</i> values < 0.001), except the transverse colon (<i>p</i> value = 0.92). The database was used to train an AI, automatically and objectively evaluating bowel preparation. <b>Conclusions:</b> We established the most thorough database in colonoscopy with previously inaccessible information, indicating that the transverse colon differs from the other parts of the colon in terms of withdrawal time for procedures with polypectomies. To further explore these findings and reach the full potential of the database, an AI evaluating bowel preparation was developed.

38421446.0,Genomic drivers in craniopharyngiomas: Analysis of the AACR project GENIE database.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Craniopharyngiomas are rare tumors originating in the sellar region, with limited information on their somatic mutational landscape. In this study, we utilized a publicly available genomic database to profile the somatic mutational landscape of craniopharyngioma patients and interrogate differences based on histologic subtype.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE)<sup>®</sup> database accessed from cBioPortal (v13.1-public) to query all patients with craniopharyngiomas.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 336 patients with sellar tumors, 51 (15.2%) had craniopharyngiomas. Of these 51 patients, 42 (82.4%) were adamantinomatous subtype and 9 (17.6%) were papillary subtype. In this cohort, 32 (62.7%) patients were pediatric, while 19 (37.3%) were adult. The top mutations in the cohort were: CTNNB1 (n = 37; 73%), BRAF (n = 7; 14%), ARID1B (n = 5; 10%), KMT2D (n = 4; 8%), FANCA (n = 4; 8%), ATM (n = 4; 8%), and TERT (n = 3; 8%). Of the 37 patients with CTNNB1 mutations, 8 (21.6%) had S33X, 9 (24.3%) had S37X, 7 (18.9%) had T41X, and 5 (13.5%) had D32X. In this cohort, CTNNB1 mutations tended to co-occur with ATM (n = 4; 10.8%), KMT2C (n = 4; 10.8%), TERT (n = 3; 8.1%), BLM (n = 3; 8.1%), and ERBB2/3 (n = 3; 8.1%), suggesting CTNNB1 mutations tended to co-occur with mutations in genes important in cell growth and survival, chromatin accessibility, and DNA damage response pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CTNNB1 mutations account for a large proportion of somatic mutations in craniopharyngiomas. Identification of specific point mutations and secondary drivers may advance development of novel craniopharyngioma preclinical models for targeted therapy testing.",bio-resource,0.5591378,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38421446,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.28155717,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37462771.0,Implementation of a clinical long-term follow-up database for adult childhood cancer survivors in Germany: a feasibility study at two specialised late effects clinics.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at risk for increased morbidity and reduced quality of life associated with treatment-related late effects. In Germany, however, only a few of the more than 40,000 CCS registered in the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR) currently benefit from adequate clinical long-term follow-up (LTFU) structures. To establish a comprehensive knowledge base on CCS' long-term health in Germany, a database was developed in cooperation with the GCCR. Following a first evaluation phase at two German university centres, this database will be implemented more widely within Germany allowing longitudinal documentation of clinical LTFU data.<h4>Methods</h4>The feasibility study cohort comprised 208 CCS aged 18 or older whose medical, mental and psychosocial health data were collected during routine LTFU or first clinic visits in adult care. CCS were enrolled from 04/2021 to 12/2022, and data entry was completed by 03/2023. Descriptive data analysis was conducted. All CCS were stratified into three risk groups (RG) based on their individual risk for developing late effects resulting from their respective diagnoses and treatments.<h4>Results</h4>Chronic health conditions of various organ systems associated with late and long-term effects of cancer therapy affected CCS in all RG supporting the clinical relevance of risk-adapted LTFU. Enrolment into the database was feasible and broadly accepted amongst CCS.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Implementation of a clinical follow-up care infrastructure and database in Germany will pave the way to collect clinically evaluated and regularly updated health data of potentially over 40,000 German CCS and facilitate future national and international cooperation.",bio-resource,0.8061623,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37462771,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.28146052,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39678829.0,Is the TriNetX Database a Good Tool for Investigation of Real-World Management of Von Hippel-Lindau?,"Von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) is a hereditary disease characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumors across multiple organ systems. It is seen in approximately 1 in 36,000 live births. Given that vHL is a rare disease, studies that seek to characterize vHL are often hampered by small sample sizes. The TriNetX database, which contains data from over 100 million patients, may offer the ability to define and describe a large number of vHL patients. The primary objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of vHL-associated conditions and investigate clinical outcomes using TriNetX. The secondary objective was to compare the results of this analysis to what has been reported in the published vHL literature. TriNetX was queried to establish a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of vHL. This cohort was then used to define the prevalence of the following conditions: reproductive organ (epididymal and broad ligament) cystadenomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic sac tumors (ESLTs), central nervous system (CNS) and retinal hemangioblastomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNETs). A total of 1232 patients in TriNetX had a recorded diagnosis of vHL. Of this, 34 (6.0% of males) patients had epididymal cystadenoma, 21 (3.4% of females) had broad ligament cystadenoma, 352 (28.6%) had RCC, 251 (20.4%) had pheochromocytoma, <10 had ELST, 171 (13.9%) had CNS hemangioblastoma, 34 (2.8%) had pNETs, and 66 (5.4%) had retinal hemangioma. Compared to the existing literature, vHL and associated conditions are underdiagnosed in TriNetX, suggesting its limited use in studying this disease.",bio-resource,0.63831294,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39678829,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.28114402,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37499165.0,Toward a Real-world Optical Coherence Tomography Reference Database: Optometric Practices as a Source of Healthy Eyes.,"<h4>Significance</h4>The reports from optical coherence tomography (OCT) instruments depend on a reference database (RDB) of healthy eyes. Although these RDBs tend to be relatively small, they are time consuming and expensive to obtain. A larger RDB should improve our ability to screen for diseases such as glaucoma.<h4>Purpose</h4>To explore the feasibility of developing a large RDB from OCT scans obtained by optometrists as part of their pre-test gathering of information, we tested the hypothesis that these scans are of sufficient quality for an RDB and contain a relatively low base rate of glaucoma and other pathologies (OPs).<h4>Methods</h4>Optical coherence tomography widefield (12 × 9 mm) scans from 400 eyes of 400 patients were randomly selected from a data set of more than 49,000 scans obtained from four optometry sites. Based on a commercial OCT report and a previously validated reading center method, two OCT graders categorized eyes as unacceptable to use for RDB, healthy (H), optic neuropathy consistent with glaucoma (ON-G), glaucoma suspect, or OPs.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 29 (7.25%) of the eyes were graded unacceptable. Of the remaining 371 eyes, 352 (94.9%) were graded H. Although, for one site, 7.4% of the eligible eyes were graded ON-G, the average for the other three sites was 1.4%. Adjustments of the reading center criteria resulted in exclusion of more than half of these ON-G and OP eyes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The OCT scans obtained from optometry practices as part of their pre-test regimen are of sufficient quality for an RDB and contain a relatively low base rate of glaucoma and OPs. With the suggested exclusion criteria, the scans from optometry practices that are primarily involved in refraction and medical screening services should yield a large, real-world RDB with improved specificity and a base rate of glaucoma and/or OPs comparable with existing RDB.",bio-resource,0.68308073,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37499165,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.280701,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37697410.0,Study design for development of novel safety biomarkers of drug-induced liver injury by the translational safety biomarker pipeline (TransBioLine) consortium: a study protocol for a nested case-control study.,"A lack of biomarkers that detect drug-induced liver injury (DILI) accurately continues to hinder early- and late-stage drug development and remains a challenge in clinical practice. The Innovative Medicines Initiative's TransBioLine consortium comprising academic and industry partners is developing a prospective repository of deeply phenotyped cases and controls with biological samples during liver injury progression to facilitate biomarker discovery, evaluation, validation and qualification.In a nested case-control design, patients who meet one of these criteria, alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥ 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2 × ULN or ALT ≥ 3 ULN with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, are enrolled. After completed clinical investigations, Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment and expert panel review are used to adjudicate episodes as DILI or alternative liver diseases (acute non-DILI controls). Two blood samples are taken: at recruitment and follow-up. Sample size is as follows: 300 cases of DILI and 130 acute non-DILI controls. Additional cross-sectional cohorts (1 visit) are as follows: Healthy volunteers (n = 120), controls with chronic alcohol-related or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 100 each) and patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis (n = 100, 50 treated with methotrexate) are enrolled. Candidate biomarkers prioritised for evaluation include osteopontin, glutamate dehydrogenase, cytokeratin-18 (full length and caspase cleaved), macrophage-colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor and high mobility group protein B1 as well as bile acids, sphingolipids and microRNAs. The TransBioLine project is enabling biomarker discovery and validation that could improve detection, diagnostic accuracy and prognostication of DILI in premarketing clinical trials and for clinical healthcare application.",bio-resource,0.6633923,1,0,0.5867,0,1,37697410,0.0,none,False,False,False,0,0,0,0.28037584,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37793303.0,EORTC 1409 GITCG/ESSO 01 - A prospective colorectal liver metastasis database for borderline or initially unresectable diseases (CLIMB): Lessons learnt from real life. From paradigm to unmet need.,"<h4>Aim</h4>Multidisciplinary management of metastatic colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is still challenging. To assess postoperative complications in initially unresectable or borderline resectable CRLM, the prospective EORTC-1409 ESSO 01-CLIMB trial capturing 'real-life data' of European centres specialized in liver surgery was initiated.<h4>Material and methods</h4>A total of 219 patients were registered between May 2015 and January 2019 from 15 centres in nine countries. Eligible patients had borderline or initially unresectable CRLM assessed by pre-operative multidisciplinary team discussion (MDT). Primary endpoints were postoperative complications, 30-day and 90-days mortality post-surgery, and quality indicators. We report the final results of the 151 eligible patients that underwent at least one liver surgery.<h4>Results</h4>Perioperative chemotherapy with or without targeted treatment were administered in 100 patients (69.4%). One stage resection (OSR) was performed in 119 patients (78.8%). Two stage resections (TSR, incl. Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS)) were completed in 24 out of 32 patients (75%). Postoperative complications were reported in 55.5% (95% CI: 46.1-64.6%), 64.0% (95% CI: 42.5-82%), and 100% (95% CI: 59-100%) of the patients in OSR, TSR and ALPPS, respectively. Post-hepatectomy liver failure occurred in 6.7%, 20.0%, and 28.6% in OSR, TSR, and ALPPS, respectively. In total, four patients (2.6%) died after surgery.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Across nine countries, OSR was more often performed than TSR and tended to result in less postoperative complications.

36789640.0,Metabolic and bariatric surgery in China: A summary of the Greater China Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Database and comparison with other international registry databases.,"<h4>Aims</h4>To summarize the Greater China Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Database (GC-MBD) and to compare patient characteristics and different procedures performed with data from published reports from other international bariatric surgery registries.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Data were extracted from the GC-MBD registry in 2021. Baseline demographic characteristics, obesity-related comorbidities and operational information were analysed. Descriptive comparisons of these data were made with the published reports from four other international/national databases, including the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) registry, the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database of the United States, the National Bariatric Surgical Registry (NBSR) of the United Kingdom, and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg).<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-three centres in China registered 6807 cases in the GC-MBD. Compared with published data from the IFSO registry, MBSAQIP, NBSR and SOReg, patients in China undergoing surgery were younger and had a lower body mass index. The incidence of other obesity-related comorbidities, except for gastroesophageal reflux disease, was also higher than in Western countries. Furthermore, more patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy, less revisional bariatric surgery was reported in China, and jejunojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy, uncommon in other countries, was China's second-leading bariatric procedure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By establishing comprehensive national registries such as the GC-MBD, real-world information can be gathered on clinical practice and patient outcomes. Insights into variations in clinical practice can be identified by comparing reports from different countries, which can help in making and evaluating healthcare policies on the best clinical practices at a national level.",bio-resource,0.9317076,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36789640,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.27957705,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36680613.0,A normative database of wide-field swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography quantitative metrics in a large cohort of healthy adults.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Data from healthy eyes is needed to interpret optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings. However, very little normative data is available for wide-field swept-source OCTA (WF SS-OCTA), particularly 12 × 12-mm and disc-centered angiograms. Therefore, we aim to report quantitative metrics in a large sample of control eyes.<h4>Methods</h4>In this cross-sectional observational study, 482 eyes of 375 healthy adults were imaged on the 100 kHz Zeiss PLEX® Elite 9000 using protocols centered on the fovea (3 × 3, 6 × 6, and 12 × 12-mm) and optic disc (6 × 6 and 12 × 12-mm) between December 2018 and January 2022. The ARI Network (Zeiss Portal v5.4) was used to calculate vessel density (VD) and vessel skeletonized density (VSD) in the superficial capillary plexus, deep capillary plexus, and whole retina, as well as foveal avascular zone (FAZ) parameters. Mixed-effect multiple linear regression models were used for statistical analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The subjects' median age was 55 (38-63) years, and 201 (53.6%) were female. Greater age and worse best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were associated with significantly lower VD and VSD (p < 0.05). VD and VSD differed based on race and cataract status, but not sex, on some scan protocols (p < 0.05). FAZ circularity decreased with age, and FAZ dimensions differed based on race and ethnicity in certain scan protocols.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report a large database of parafoveal and peripapillary vascular metrics in several angiogram sizes. In referencing these values, researchers must consider characteristics such as age, race, and BCVA, but will have a valuable point of comparison for OCTA measurements in pathologic settings.",bio-resource,0.89075977,1,0,0.5867,0,1,36680613,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.2794375,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

The articles included assessed a patient-centered outcome for HEMS versus a non-HEMS control group. Article characteristics included the journal impact factor (JIF), diagnostic group (trauma or nontrauma), and geographic origin. Categoric analyses comparing 2023 studies with HOARD studies from the previous decade (2013-2022) were executed with the Fisher exact test; nonnormal JIF data were described using median and interquartile range and analyzed (vs 2013-2022) with rank sum testing.<h4>Results</h4>Of the initial records (N = 4,486), 4,410 were screened out, leaving 76 for full-text review. Of these, 58 were discarded, and 18 were classified as eligible for addition to HOARD. Most studies (14/18, 78%) focused on trauma, and an equally high proportion (14/18, 78%) came from North America. The median JIF was 2.4 (interquartile range, 1.2-3.6). Compared with HOARD studies from the previous decade, 2023 studies were similar with respect to diagnostic focus (P = .779), geographic origin (P = .171), and JIF (P = .531).<h4>Conclusion</h4>This scoping review provides information on 18 HEMS outcomes studies new to the evidence base in 2023.",bio-resource,0.72844195,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39293915,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.27928427,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
35933725.0,Analysis of a national difficult airway database.,"Difficult airway management continues to adversely affect patient care and clinical outcomes and is poorly predicted. Previous difficult airway management is the most accurate predictor of future difficulty. The Difficult Airway Society initiated a national airway database to allow clinicians to access details of previous difficult airway episodes in patients issued with a difficult airway alert card. We aimed to analyse this database, reporting patient characteristics, airway management and patient outcomes. We included all living adult patients reported in the first 5 years of the database (n = 675). Clinical airway assessment was reported in 634 (94%) patients, with three or more parameters assessed in 488 (72%). A history of difficult airway was known in 136 (20%) patients and difficult airway management was anticipated in 391 (58%). In all, 75 (11%) patients had an airway-related critical incident, with 1 in 29 being awoken from anaesthesia, 1 in 34 requiring unplanned or prolonged stay in the intensive care unit and 1 in 225 needing an emergency front-of-neck airway or had a cardiac arrest/peri-arrest episode. Airway-related critical incidents were associated with out-of-hours airway management, but no other associations were apparent. Our data report the first analysis of a national difficult airway database, finding that unanticipated difficult airway management continues to occur despite airway assessment, and the rate of critical incidents in this cohort of patients is high.

38975326.0,Genomic and phenotypic inconsistencies in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> resistome among intensive care patients.,"<h4>Objective</h4><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a difficult-to-manage nosocomial pathogen, poses a serious threat to clinical outcomes in intensive care (ICU) patients due to its high antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To promote effective management, it is essential to investigate the genomic and phenotypic differences in AMR expression of the isolates.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective observational study was conducted from July 2022 to April 2023 at Liepaja Regional Hospital in Latvia. The study included all adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and had a documented infection with <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, as confirmed by standard laboratory microbiological testing and short-read sequencing. Since ResFinder is the only sequencing-based database offering antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) data for each antibiotic, we conducted a comparison of the resistance profile with the results of phenotypic testing, evaluating if ResFinder met the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for approval as a new AMR diagnostic test. Next, to improve precision, AST data from ResFinder was compared with two other databases - AMRFinderPlus and RGI. Additionally, data was gathered from environmental samples to inform the implementation of appropriate infection control measures in real time.<h4>Results</h4>Our cohort consisted of 33 samples from 29 ICU patients and 34 environmental samples. The presence of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection was found to be associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes. A third of the patient samples were identified as multi-drug resistant isolates. Apart from resistance against colistin, significant discrepancies were observed when phenotypic data were compared to genotypic data. For example, the aminoglycoside resistance prediction of ResFinder yielded a major errors value of 3.03% for amikacin, which was marginally above the FDA threshold. Among the three positive environmental samples, one sample exhibited multiple AMR genes similar to the patient samples in its cluster.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings underscore the importance of utilizing a combination of diagnostic methods for the identification of resistance mechanisms, clusters, and environmental reservoirs in ICUs.",bio-resource,0.6894907,1,1,0.7466,1,1,38975326,0.0,impl_kw=1; usage_kw=1,False,False,False,1,1,0,0.27918634,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36535702.0,Using the IMEDS distributed database for epidemiological studies in type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>This study aimed to assess data relevancy and data quality of the Innovation in Medical Evidence Development and Surveillance System Distributed Database (IMEDS-DD) for diabetes research and to evaluate comparability of its type 2 diabetes cohort to the general type 2 diabetes population.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>A retrospective study was conducted using the IMEDS-DD. Eligible members were adults with a medical encounter between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019 (index period). Type 2 diabetes and co-existing conditions were determined using all data available from April 1, 2016 to the most recent encounter within the index period. Type 2 diabetes patient characteristics, comorbidities and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) values were summarized and compared with those reported in national benchmarks and literature.<h4>Results</h4>Type 2 diabetes prevalence was 12.6% in the IMEDS-DD. Of 4 14 672 patients with type 2 diabetes, 52.8% were male, and the mean age was 65.0 (SD 13.3) years. Common comorbidities included hypertension (84.5%), hyperlipidemia (82.8%), obesity (45.3%), and cardiovascular disease (44.7%). Moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease was observed in 20.2% patients. The most commonly used antihyperglycemic agents included metformin (35.7%), sulfonylureas (14.8%), and insulin (9.9%). Less than one-half (48.9%) had an HbA<sub>1c</sub> value recorded. These findings demonstrated the notable similarity in patient characteristics between type 2 diabetes populations identified within the IMEDS-DD and other large databases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the limitations related to HbA<sub>1c</sub> data, our findings indicate that the IMEDS-DD contains robust information on key data elements to conduct pharmacoepidemiological studies in diabetes, including member demographic and clinical characteristics and health services utilization.",bio-resource,0.70992637,1,1,0.7466,1,1,36535702,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.2786601,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
36901730.0,Characteristics of the (Auto)Reactive T Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis According to the Immune Epitope Database.,"T cells are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accordingly, and to better understand T cells' contribution to RA, a comprehensive review based on an analysis of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) was conducted. An immune CD8+ T cell senescence response is reported in RA and inflammatory diseases, which is driven by active viral antigens from latent viruses and cryptic self-apoptotic peptides. RA-associated pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells are selected by MHC class II and immunodominant peptides, which are derived from molecular chaperones, host extra-cellular and cellular peptides that could be post-translationally modified (PTM), and bacterial cross-reactive peptides. A large panel of techniques have been used to characterize (auto)reactive T cells and RA-associated peptides with regards to their interaction with the MHC and TCR, capacity to enter the docking site of the shared epitope (DRB1-SE), capacity to induce T cell proliferation, capacity to select T cell subsets (Th1/Th17, Treg), and clinical contribution. Among docking DRB1-SE peptides, those with PTM expand autoreactive and high-affinity CD4+ memory T cells in RA patients with an active disease. Considering original therapeutic options in RA, mutated, or altered peptide ligands (APL) have been developed and are tested in clinical trials.",bio-resource,0.9923511,1,1,0.7462,1,1,36901730,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.2781797,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive

Mean ± standard deviation and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the thickness asymmetry values were obtained for all the corresponding cells.<h4>Results</h4>All the macular layers had significant superior-inferior thickness asymmetries. GCL, IPL, INL, ONL and RPE showed significantly greater thicknesses in the superior than the inferior hemisphere, whereas RNFL and OPL were thicker in the inferior hemisphere. The largest differences between hemispheres were for RNFL and ONL.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first normative database of macular thickness asymmetries for the PPA and should be considered to distinguish normal from pathological values when interpreting superior-inferior macular asymmetries.",bio-resource,0.6485315,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38137678,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.27808177,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38399420.0,Risk Factors for Respiratory Depression Associated with Tramadol Based on the Global Pharmacovigilance Database (VigiBase).,"Tramadol, a weak μ-opioid receptor agonist, has been used worldwide for pain management. It is considered to have a favorable safety profile without serious adverse events; however, safety issues of respiratory depression were proposed by regulatory governments. We aimed to examine the risk and contributing factors associated with tramadol-related respiratory depression using a real-world database, VigiBase. Disproportionality analysis of tramadol and tramadol/paracetamol was performed using proportional reporting ratios, reporting odds ratios, and information components for all drugs and opioids. Factors related to respiratory depression, including sex, age, presence of abuse, death, and various concomitant medications, were evaluated. Among 140,721 tramadol reports, respiratory depression was reported in 1126 cases, 81.3% of which were deemed serious. Five adverse events were detected as signals of tramadol-related acute central respiratory depression (ACRD) in 882 reports. A higher proportion of ACRD cases in children and adolescents was observed than all adverse events cases of tramadol. Concomitant users of CYP2D6 inhibitors, opioids, benzodiazepines, and anti-depressant drugs showed a higher proportion in ACRD cases than non-ACRD cases. ACRD was related to drug abuse and death. This pharmacovigilance study, using VigiBase, confirmed a high risk of respiratory depression (a serious, potentially fatal adverse event) secondary to the use of tramadol, especially in pediatric patients, drug abusers, or during concomitant use of opioids, benzodiazepines, or antidepressants.",bio-resource,0.6344384,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38399420,0.0,title_pattern; usage_kw=2,False,True,False,0,2,0,0.27758047,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
39361315.0,Characteristics of a Large Database of Healthy Eyes From Optometry Practices: Implications for a Real-World Reference Database.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To compare an optical coherence tomography (OCT) real-world reference database (RW-RDB) of ""healthy"" eyes obtained from optometry practices to a commercial reference database (RDB).<h4>Methods</h4>OCT scans from 6804 individuals 18 years and older were sampled from a larger database tested at 10 optometry practices involved in refractive and screening services. Employing a reading center method, OCT scans from both eyes of 4932 (4.9K) individuals were judged to be of acceptable quality with an absence of pathology. The 4.9K RW-RDB was compared to a commercial RDB with 398 eyes (398 RDB).<h4>Results</h4>The means and distributions of global circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (G-cpRNFL) and global ganglion cell layer (G-GCL) thickness, as well as five key anatomical parameters affecting cpRNFL thickness, were not significantly different for all but one parameter (fovea-to-disc distance) and one thickness metric (G-cpRNFL). In both cases, the difference amounted to less than 1.5%. By design, the number of 4.9K RW-RDB eyes 70 years and older (724, 14.7%) was greater than for the 398 RDB (40, 10.1%). The error bands on the 5% and 1% quantile regression lines (QRLs) were substantially narrower for the 4.9K RW-RDB.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The 398 RDB and 4.9K RW-RDB have similar characteristics and appear to come from a similar population. However, the large size of the 4.9K RW-RDB leads to narrower error bands of the QRLs, which has the potential to increase accuracy.<h4>Translational relevance</h4>The larger RW-RDB offers the opportunity to better characterize healthy eyes for clinical diagnosis and clinical trials by furthering our understanding of the patterns of artifacts, exploring covariates, developing separate RW-RDBs, and/or improving AI models.",bio-resource,0.756657,1,1,0.7466,1,1,39361315,1.5,title_pattern; impl_kw=1,False,True,False,1,0,0,0.27748063,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37977060.0,"""Repository of Cochlear Implant Information:"" A Multi-Institutional REDCap Database.","<h4>Purpose</h4>To describe the creation of a multi-center cochlear implant database as a template for future medical database design. The first clinical question examined was the association between BMI on cochlear implant surgical time and postoperative outcome.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A retrospective repository in REDCap, named the ""Repository of Cochlear Implant Information"" (ROCII), was created and collected de-identified data on patients who underwent cochlear implantation. Data was exported and stratified into three BMI groupings (<25, 25.0-29.9, ≥ 30.0). Differences in surgical time and AZBio Sentence Test postoperative score changes were analyzed using the mixed-effect model.<h4>Results</h4>The mean BMI (n = 145) was 28.52, and the mean surgical time was 128.9 min. The BMI < 25 reference group (n = 50) and the BMI 25.0-29.9 group (n = 50) had an identical mean surgical time of 127.5 min. The BMI ≥30.0 group (n = 45) had a mean surgical time of 132 min, however this difference was not statistically significant when compared to the reference group (p = 0.4727). The mean AZBio postoperative score change (n = 74) was 63.32. The BMI < 25 reference group (n = 29) had a mean postoperative change of 56.66. The BMI 25.0-29.9 group (n = 22) and BMI ≥30.0 group (n = 23) had mean postoperative changes of 61.32 and 73.65 respectively, however these differences were not statistically significant compared to the reference group (p = 0.5847, 0.0637).<h4>Conclusion</h4>BMI did not have a significant association with surgical time or postoperative outcome and therefore should not be a contraindication for implantation.

39717747.0,The value of real world evidence and pragmatic trials in advanced prostate cancer- insights from the electronic Prostate Cancer Australian and Asian Database.,"Prostate cancer is a common malignancy with an increasing incidence in ageing populations. However, older patients with prostate cancer are often underrepresented in traditional clinical trials. The electronic Prostate Cancer Australian and Asian Database (ePAD) is a multi-centre, multi-national prospective clinical registry, that records real world data from a broader population. An analysis of the first 753 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients within ePAD demonstrated that 43% were aged 75 years and older. Older patients were more likely to have comorbidities including ischemic heart disease, diabetes and previous stroke. Treatment outcomes were similar in all age groups. However, older patients receiving chemotherapy were more likely to stop treatment due to toxicity. Furthermore, in a smaller ePAD analysis involving additional chart reviews within 3 high volume centres, at least one relative or absolute contraindication to abiraterone was seen in 72% of our cohort and with enzalutamide in 14%. In total, 47% had potential clinically significant drug interactions with abiraterone and 67% with enzalutamide. Registry-based randomised controlled trials (RRCTs) are a novel trial methodology aiming to bridge the gap between retrospective registry analyses and traditional randomised controlled trials. We conducted the REAL-Pro study in advanced prostate cancer, comparing cognition, depression and falls risk between CRPC patients receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide. The study closed early due to slow recruitment and a changing treatment landscape, highlighting the need for further research to understand clinician and patient perspectives towards pragmatic trials such as RRCTs and subsequently develop strategies to optimise future trial design and recruitment.",bio-resource,0.5021909,1,0,0.5867,0,1,39717747,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.27713266,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37513988.0,Establishment and Evaluation of a Parametric Population Pharmacokinetic Model Repository for Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir.,"<h4>Background</h4>Ganciclovir and valganciclovir are used for prophylaxis and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection. However, there is great interindividual variability in ganciclovir's pharmacokinetics (PK), highlighting the importance of individualized dosing. To facilitate model-informed precision dosing (MIPD), this study aimed to establish a parametric model repository of ganciclovir and valganciclovir by summarizing existing population pharmacokinetic information and analyzing the sources of variability. (2) Methods: A total of four databases were searched for published population PK models. We replicated these models, evaluated the impact of covariates on clearance, calculated the probability of target attainment for each model based on a predetermined dosing regimen, and developed an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) calculator using maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation. (3) Results: A total of 16 models, one- or two-compartment models, were included. The most significant covariates were body size (weight and body surface area) and renal function. The results show that 5 mg/kg/12 h of ganciclovir could make the AUC<sub>0-24h</sub> within 40-80 mg·h/L for 50.03% pediatrics but cause AUC<sub>0-24h</sub> exceeding the exposure thresholds for toxicity (120 mg·h/L) in 51.24% adults.

34505630.0,The International Database of Central Arterial Properties for Risk Stratification: Research Objectives and Baseline Characteristics of Participants.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To address to what extent central hemodynamic measurements, improve risk stratification, and determine outcome-based diagnostic thresholds, we constructed the International Database of Central Arterial Properties for Risk Stratification (IDCARS), allowing a participant-level meta-analysis. The purpose of this article was to describe the characteristics of IDCARS participants and to highlight research perspectives.<h4>Methods</h4>Longitudinal or cross-sectional cohort studies with central blood pressure measured with the SphygmoCor devices and software were included.<h4>Results</h4>The database included 10,930 subjects (54.8% women; median age 46.0 years) from 13 studies in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. The prevalence of office hypertension was 4,446 (40.1%), of which 2,713 (61.0%) were treated, and of diabetes mellitus was 629 (5.8%). The peripheral and central systolic/diastolic blood pressure averaged 129.5/78.7 mm Hg and 118.2/79.7 mm Hg, respectively. Mean aortic pulse wave velocity was 7.3 m per seconds. Among 6,871 participants enrolled in 9 longitudinal studies, the median follow-up was 4.2 years (5th-95th percentile interval, 1.3-12.2 years). During 38,957 person-years of follow-up, 339 participants experienced a composite cardiovascular event and 212 died, 67 of cardiovascular disease.<h4>Conclusions</h4>IDCARS will provide a unique opportunity to investigate hypotheses on central hemodynamic measurements that could not reliably be studied in individual studies.

Understanding the current landscape of MM treatment options and associated outcomes in the real world is important in providing key insights into clinical and knowledge gaps which could be targeted for further optimization.<h4>Methods</h4>The Canadian Myeloma Research Group Database (CMRG-DB) is a prospectively maintained disease-specific database with >7000 patients. The objective of this study was to describe the trends in the treatment landscape and outcomes including early mortality, time to next treatment, and overall survival (OS) in each line of treatment stratified by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) receipt among newly-diagnosed MM patients in Canada between 2007 and 2018.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 5154 patients were identified among which 3030 patients (58.8%) received an upfront ASCT and 2124 (41.2%) did not. At diagnosis, the median age was 64 years and 58.6% were males. Bortezomib and lenalidomide were most frequently used (>50%) in first and second-line treatment respectively among both the ASCT and non-ASCT cohort. The median OS was 122.0 months (95% Cl 115.0-135.0 months) and 54.3 months (95% CI 50.8-58.8 months) for the ASCT and non-ASCT cohort respectively with an incremental decrease in OS in each subsequent line of treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present the largest study to date in the Canadian landscape showing the characteristics, therapy usage, and outcomes among MM patients.

Using the TEMPO/IMOvifa automated perimeter (Topcon Healthcare/CREWT Medical Systems), each subject completed 4 binocular threshold visual field (VF) tests during a single visit: First, practice 24-2 and 10-2 tests were obtained from both eyes. Next, study 24-2 and 10-2 tests were obtained from both eyes. Test order of each sequence was randomized, and the tests were conducted under standard automated perimetry testing conditions: Goldmann stimulus size III, 3183 cd/m<sup>2</sup> maximum stimulus intensity, and background intensity of 10 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, using AIZE-Rapid test strategy. Standard VF reliability indices were assessed. For each subject, 24-2 and 10-2 test results from 1 randomly selected eye were analyzed.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>Perimetric threshold sensitivity and reference limits for each test analysis parameter.<h4>Results</h4>The ages of the study cohort were widely distributed, with a mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of 52.3 (18.5) years.

38945507.0,Bone turnover markers reference database in five Southeast Asian countries.,"Osteoporosis is highly prevalent, particularly in developing countries. However, bone turnover marker reference ranges for management of osteoporosis in Asian population are yet to be explored and established. Thus, this study aims to develop a regional bone turnover markers (BTMs) reference database by combining country-specific reference database from five ASEAN countries: Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. We established a healthy reference population of 746 healthy premenopausal women aged 20 to 44 years old. Serum Procollagen 1 N-Terminal Propeptide (P1NP), Osteocalcin (OC), and Beta-Crosslaps (CTX) concentrations were measured using an automated immunoassay analyzer system, the cobas® modular analyzer systems (Roche Diagnostic Gmbh). The reference interval was defined as the central 95 % range. The estimated reference interval for CTX was 128 to 811 ng/L, OC was 9.0 to 33.0 μg/L, and for P1NP, the range was 22.8 to 96.5 μg/L. Comparison across countries showed that Singaporeans had the highest levels of median CTX along with Thais and Filipinos, who had significantly higher levels of P1NP and OC. Exploratory analysis on the associations with age showed that BTMs decreased with increasing age at 20 to 29 years old and plateaued after 30 years old. When excluding participants in their 20s, the reference interval estimated were CTX: 117-678 ng/L, P1NP: 21.6-85.8 μg/L and OC: 3.5-27.0 μg/L respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report BTMs reference intervals based on a healthy premenopausal Southeast Asian population which will contribute to the appropriate assessment and monitoring of bone turnover rate in the evaluation and management of osteoporosis in the Southeast Asian region. LAY SUMMARY: Osteoporosis is a common health issue, especially in developing countries. However, there is a lack of information on bone health markers specific to the Southeast Asian population. This study aimed to fill this gap by creating a reference database for bone turnover markers (BTMs) in Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The researchers studied 746 healthy women aged 20 to 44 years and measured blood markers related to bone health. The reference interval, representing the normal range, was determined. For example, the normal range for CTX was found to be 128 to 811 ng/L, for Osteocalcin was 9.0 to 33.0 μg/L, and for P1NP, the range was 22.8 to 96.5 μg/L. When excluding participants in their 20s, the reference intervals estimated were CTX: 117-678 ng/L, P1NP: 21.6-85.8 μg/L and OC: 3.5-27.0 μg/L respectively. Comparing the results across countries, Singaporeans, Thais, and Filipinos showed variations in their biochemical bone marker levels. Additionally, the study observed changes in the levels with age, with a decrease in BTMs observed after the age of 30. This groundbreaking study provides the first-ever reference intervals for BTMs in a healthy premenopausal Southeast Asian population. These findings will help in the proper assessment and monitoring of bone health, contributing to the management of osteoporosis in the Southeast Asian region.",bio-resource,0.96022815,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38945507,1.0,title_pattern,False,True,False,0,0,0,0.27396494,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
38638976.0,Establishment and clinical application of the HLA genotype database of platelet-apheresis donors in Suzhou.,"The establishment of a platelet-apheresis donor database may provide a feasible solution to improve the efficacy of platelet transfusion in patients with immune platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR). This study aimed to establish HLA genotype database in Suzhou, to provide HLA-I compatible platelets for PTR patients to ensure the safety and effectiveness of platelet transfusions. We used a polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) method to establish the database by performing high-resolution HLA-A, -B, and -C genotyping on 900 platelet-apheresis donors. HLA-I antibody was detected in patients using a Luminex device, and HLA-I gene matching was performed by an HLA-Matchmaker. We found that the highest frequency of the HLA-A allele was A*11:01 (17.06 %), followed by A*24:02 (14.67 %) and A*02:01 (13.61 %). The highest frequency of the HLA-B allele was B*46:01 (9.78 %), followed by B*40:01 (8.39 %) and B*13:02 (33 %). After the detection of platelet antibodies in 74 patients with immune PTR, we found 30 HLA-A antibodies and 48 HLA-B antibodies, and there were a variety of high frequency antibodies whose alleles were low in the donor database, such as HLA-A*68:02, and B*57:01. After avoiding donor-specific antibodies (DSA) matching, 102 of 209 platelet-compatible transfusions were effective, resulting in an effective rate of 48.8 %, which significantly improved the efficacy of platelet transfusion. The establishment of a platelet donor database is of great significance to improve the therapeutic effect of platelet transfusion in patients with hematologic disorder, and save blood resources, and it is also the premise and guarantee of precise platelet transfusion.",bio-resource,0.9539336,1,0,0.5867,0,1,38638976,-0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=3,False,True,False,0,3,0,0.27247134,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
37356802.0,European Epidemiology of Pleural Mesothelioma-Real-Life Data From a Joint Analysis of the Mesoscape Database of the European Thoracic Oncology Platform and the European Society of Thoracic Surgery Mesothelioma Database.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Pleural mesothelioma (PM) is an aggressive malignancy with increasing prevalence and poor prognosis. Real-life data are a unique approach to reflect the reality of PM epidemiology, treatment, and prognosis in Europe.<h4>Methods</h4>A joint analysis of the European Thoracic Oncology Platform Mesoscape and the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) databases was performed to better understand the characteristics and epidemiology of PM, including histologic subtype, staging, and treatment. Overall survival (OS) was assessed, adjusting for parameters of clinical interest.<h4>Results</h4>The analysis included 2766 patients (Mesoscape: 497/10 centers/ESTS: 2269/77 centers). The primary histologic subtype was epithelioid (71%), with 57% patients on stages III to IV. Within Mesoscape, the patients received either multimodality (59%) or palliative intention treatment (41%). The median follow-up was 47.2 months, on the basis of 1103 patients (Mesoscape: 491/ESTS: 612), with 823 deaths, and median OS was 17.4 months. In multivariable analysis, female sex, epithelioid subtype, and lower stage were associated with longer OS, when stratifying by cohort, age, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status. Within Mesoscape, multimodality treatment including surgery was predictive of longer OS (hazard ratio = 0.56, 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.69), adjusting for sex, histologic subtype, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status. Overall, surgical candidates with a macroscopic complete resection had a significantly longer median OS compared with patients with R2 (25.2 m versus 16.4 m; log-rank p < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This combined European Thoracic Oncology Platform/ESTS database analysis offers one of the largest databases with detailed clinical and pathologic outcome. Our finding reflects a benefit for selected patients that undergo multimodality treatment, including macroscopic complete resection, and represents a valuable resource to inform the epidemiology and treatment options for individual patients.",bio-resource,0.5874316,1,1,0.7466,1,1,37356802,0.5,title_pattern; usage_kw=1,False,True,False,0,1,0,0.2724605,low,USAGE,v2_classifier_positive
