34489228.0,Serum microRNAs Catalog Asthma Patients by Phenotype.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways with a complex pathophysiology. Stratification of asthma subtypes into phenotypes and endotypes should move the field forward, making treatment more effective and personalized. Eosinophils are the key inflammatory cells involved in severe eosinophilic asthma. Given the health threat posed by eosinophilic asthma, there is a need for reliable biomarkers to identify affected patients and treat them properly with novel biologics. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a promising diagnostic tool. The aim of this study was to identify serum miRNAs that can phenotype asthma patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Serum miRNAs of patients with eosinophilic asthma (N=40) and patients with noneosinophilic asthma (N=36) were evaluated using next-generation sequencing, specifically miRNAs-seq, and selected miRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR. Pathway enrichment analysis of deregulated miRNAs was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Next-generation sequencing revealed 15 miRNAs that were expressed differentially between eosinophilic and noneosinophilic asthma patients, although no differences were observed in the miRNome between atopic and nonatopic asthma patients. Of the 15 miRNAs expressed differentially between eosinophilic and noneosinophilic asthma patients, hsa-miR-26a-1-3p and hsa-miR-376a-3p were validated by RT-qPCR. Expression levels of these 2 miRNAs were higher in eosinophilic than in noneosinophilic asthma patients. Furthermore, expression values of hsa-miR-26a-1-3p correlated inversely with peripheral blood eosinophil count, and hsa-miR-376a-3p expression values correlated with FeNO values and the number of exacerbations. Additionally, in silico pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these 2 miRNAs regulate signaling pathways associated with the pathogenesis of asthma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>hsa-miR-26a-1-3p and hsa-miR-376a-3p could be used to differentiate between eosinophilic and noneosinophilic asthma.",not-bio-resource,0.9987256,0,1,0.7466,1,1,34489228,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
35209223.0,Baicalin Targets HSP70/90 to Regulate PKR/PI3K/AKT/eNOS Signaling Pathways.,"Baicalin is a major active ingredient of traditional Chinese medicine <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, and has been shown to have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activities. However, the protein targets of baicalin have remained unclear. Herein, a chemical proteomics strategy was developed by combining baicalin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (BCL-N<sub>3</sub>@MNPs) and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify the target proteins of baicalin. Bioinformatics analysis with the use of Gene Ontology, STRING and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, was performed to annotate the biological functions and the associated signaling pathways of the baicalin targeting proteins. Fourteen proteins in human embryonic kidney cells were identified to interact with baicalin with various binding affinities. Bioinformatics analysis revealed these proteins are mainly ATP-binding and/or ATPase activity proteins, such as CKB, HSP86, HSP70-1, HSP90, ATPSF1β and ACTG1, and highly associated with the regulation of the role of PKR in interferon induction and the antiviral response signaling pathway (<i>P</i> = 10<sup>-6</sup>), PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<i>P</i> = 10<sup>-5</sup>) and eNOS signaling pathway (<i>P</i> = 10<sup>-4</sup>). The results show that baicalin exerts multiply pharmacological functions, such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant functions, through regulating the PKR and PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathways by targeting ATP-binding and ATPase activity proteins. These findings provide a fundamental insight into further studies on the mechanism of action of baicalin.",not-bio-resource,0.9978787,0,1,0.7466,1,1,35209223,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
35871777.0,"Integrating Network Pharmacology, Molecular Docking, and Experimental Validation to Investigate the Mechanism of (-)-Guaiol Against Lung Adenocarcinoma.","BACKGROUND Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common type of lung cancer, which poses a serious threat to human life and health. -(-)Guaiol, an effective ingredient of many medicinal herbs, has been shown to have a high potential for tumor interference and suppression. However, knowledge of pharmacological mechanisms is still lacking adequate identification or interpretation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The genes of LUAD patients collected from TCGA were analyzed using limma and WGCNA. In addition, targets of (-)-Guaiol treating LUAD were selected through a prediction network. Venn analysis was then used to visualize the overlapping genes, which were further condensed using the PPI network. GO and KEGG analyses were performed sequentially, and the essential targets were evaluated and validated using molecular docking. In addition, cell-based verification, including the CCK-8 assay, cell death assessment, apoptosis analysis, and western blot, was performed to determine the mechanism of action of (-)-Guaiol. RESULTS The genes included 959 differentially-expressed genes, 6075 highly-correlated genes, and 480 drug-target genes. Through multivariate analysis, 23 hub genes were identified and functional enrichment analyses revealed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was the most significant. Experiment results showed that -(-)Guaiol can inhibit LUAD cell growth and induce apoptosis. Additional evidence suggested that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway established an inseparable role in the antitumor processes of -(-)Guaiol, which is consistent with network pharmacology results. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that the effect of (-)-Guaiol in LUAD treatment involves the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, providing a useful reference and medicinal value in the treatment of LUAD.",not-bio-resource,0.9986387,0,1,0.7466,1,1,35871777,-2.0,usage_kw=4,False,False,False,0,4
35940363.0,Evaluation of an Integrated Spectroscopy and Classification Platform for Point-of-Care Core Needle Biopsy Assessment: Performance Characteristics from Ex Vivo Renal Mass Biopsies.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To evaluate a transmission optical spectroscopy instrument for rapid ex vivo assessment of core needle cancer biopsies (CNBs) at the point of care.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>CNBs from surgically resected renal tumors and nontumor regions were scanned on their sampling trays with a custom spectroscopy instrument. After extracting principal spectral components, machine learning was used to train logistic regression, support vector machines, and random decision forest (RF) classifiers on 80% of randomized and stratified data. The algorithms were evaluated on the remaining 20% of the data set held out during training. Binary classification (tumor/nontumor) was performed based on a decision threshold. Multinomial classification was also performed to differentiate between the subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and account for potential confounding effects from fat, blood, and necrotic tissue. Classifiers were compared based on sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) relative to a histopathologic standard.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 545 CNBs from 102 patients were analyzed, yielding 5,583 spectra after outlier exclusion. At the individual spectra level, the best performing algorithm was RF with sensitivities of 96% and 92% and specificities of 90% and 89%, for the binary and multiclass analyses, respectively. At the full CNB level, RF algorithm also showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (93% and 91%, respectively). For RCC subtypes, the highest sensitivity and PPV were attained for clear cell (93.5%) and chromophobe (98.2%) subtypes, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Ex vivo spectroscopy imaging paired with machine learning can accurately characterize renal mass CNB at the time of tissue acquisition.",not-bio-resource,0.9988896,0,1,0.7466,1,1,35940363,-1.5,impl_kw=1; usage_kw=4,False,False,False,1,4
35941308.0,Efficacy and safety of one-step knife compared to conventional insulated-tip knife for endoscopic submucosal dissection: a preliminary study with prospective data collection and retrospective review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is not as tiresome as gastrectomy, but it is a time-consuming procedure. One-step knife (OSK) is a novel knife that combines a knife for ESD and an injection needle into one sheath. In this study, we aimed to compare the insulated tip type of OSK and conventional knife (CK) in terms of procedure time and complication rate.<h4>Methods</h4>Medical records of patients with ESD using CK between February and September 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Subsequently, data from patients who underwent ESD using OSK by September 2021 were prospectively collected. Total procedure time, procedure time by location and complication rate in the OSK and CK group were compared.<h4>Results</h4>In the study period, a total of 203 patients (OSK, 102 patients; CK, 101 patients) were analyzed. On multivariate analysis, using CK, body location, resection size ≥ 40 mm, and submucosal fibrosis were associated with longer procedure time. The total procedure time was statistically significantly reduced in the OSK group (median 11 vs. 17 min, p < 0.01). The procedure time for each location was more reduced in the body (median 14 vs. 19 min p < 0.01) than the antrum (median 10 vs. 14 min, p = 0.01) in the OSK group. There was no significant difference in post-ESD bleeding and perforation in the two groups (3.9 vs. 3.9%, p = 0.99 and 1.0 vs. 2.0%, p = 0.56).<h4>Conclusions</h4>OSK significantly reduced the total procedure time of ESD.

Bacterial isolates (<i>n</i> = 43) were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS), combining Illumina (MiSeq) and Nanopore (MinION) technologies, from which high-quality genomes (chromosome and plasmids) were <i>de novo</i> assembled. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed along with genome analyses, which identified intrinsic and acquired resistance determinants along with their genetic environments and vehicles. Furthermore, the bacterial isolates were compared to the most prevalent A. baumannii sequence type 2 (ST2) (Pasteur scheme) genomes available from the BIGSdb database. Of the 43 strains, 40 carried determinants of resistance to carbapenems; <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> (<i>n</i> = 29) was the most abundant acquired antimicrobial resistance gene, with 39 isolates encoding at least two different types of OXA enzymes. According to the Pasteur scheme, the majority of the isolates were globally disseminated clones of ST2 (<i>n</i> = 25), while less frequent sequence types included ST636 (<i>n</i> = 6), ST1 (<i>n</i> = 4), ST85 and ST78 (<i>n</i> = 2 each), and ST604, ST215, ST158, and ST10 (<i>n</i> = 1 each). Using the Oxford typing scheme, we identified 22 STs, including two novel types (ST2454 and ST2455). While the majority (26/29) of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> genes were chromosomally carried, all <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-72</sub> genes were plasmid borne. Our results show the presence of high-risk clones of A. baumannii within Belgian health care facilities with frequent occurrences of genes encoding carbapenemases, highlighting the crucial need for constant surveillance.",not-bio-resource,0.9644579,0,1,0.7466,1,1,35969073,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
36319680.0,Physiological status and anatomical severity factors associated with child versus adult bicyclist fatalities based on a national trauma dataset.,"Bicyclists still account for the majority of child deaths in traffic accidents, despite a gradual decrease in incidence. Therefore, we investigated factors associated with child and adult bicyclist fatalities. In this retrospective study, we used data from a national hospital-based database, the Japan Trauma Data Bank. Data from 2004 to 2019 were obtained for child cyclists (5-18 years; n = 4832) and adult cyclists (26-45 years; n = 3449). In each age group, physiological variables, outcomes, and injury severity were compared between fatal and non-fatal cases. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with fatality. In adults, fatality was associated with lower values for body temperature, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score for the neck and upper extremities, and with higher values for respiratory rate, heart rate, focused assessment with sonography for trauma positivity rate, and AIS scores for the head, chest, and abdomen. In children, fatality was associated with lower values for body temperature and the Glasgow Coma Scale score, and with higher values for the AIS chest score. These findings point to factors associated with bicyclist fatalities and may help in the development of effective strategies to reduce these fatalities.",not-bio-resource,0.99854785,0,1,0.7466,1,1,36319680,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
36481486.0,Host microRNAs exhibit differential propensity to interact with SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern.,"A significant number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals naturally overcome viral infection, suggesting the existence of a potent endogenous antiviral mechanism. As an innate defense mechanism, microRNA (miRNA) pathways in mammals have evolved to restrict viruses, besides regulating endogenous mRNAs. In this study, we systematically examined the complete repertoire of human miRNAs for potential binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Human miRNA and viral genome interaction were analyzed using RNAhybrid 2.2 with stringent parameters to identify highly bonafide miRNA targets. Using publicly available data, we filtered for miRNAs expressed in lung epithelial cells/tissue and oral keratinocytes, concentrating on the miRNAs that target SARS-CoV-2 S protein mRNAs. Our results show a significant loss of human miRNA and SARS-CoV-2 interactions in Omicron (130 miRNAs) compared to Wuhan-Hu-1 (271 miRNAs), Beta (279 miRNAs), and Delta (275 miRNAs). In particular, hsa-miR-3150b-3p and hsa-miR-4784 show binding affinity for S protein of Wuhan strain but not Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Loss of miRNA binding sites on N protein was also observed for Omicron. Through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we examined the experimentally validated and highly predicted functional role of these miRNAs. We found that hsa-miR-3150b-3p and hsa-miR-4784 have several experimentally validated or highly predicted target genes in the Toll-like receptor, IL-17, Th1, Th2, interferon, and coronavirus pathogenesis pathways. Focusing on the coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, we found that hsa-miR-3150b-3p and hsa-miR-4784 are highly predicted to target MAPK13.

36917592.0,"Examining neighborhood-level hot and cold spots of food insecurity in relation to social vulnerability in Houston, Texas.","Food insecurity is prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes, but little is known about its geographical nature. The aim of this study is to utilize geospatial modeling of individual-level food insecurity screening data ascertained in health care settings to test for neighborhood hot and cold spots of food insecurity in a large metropolitan area, and then compare these hot spot neighborhoods to cold spot neighborhoods in terms of the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index. In this cross-sectional secondary data analysis, we geocoded the home addresses of 6,749 unique participants screened for food insecurity at health care locations participating in CMS's Accountable Health Communities (AHC) Model, as implemented in Houston, TX. Next, we created census-tract level incidence profiles of positive food insecurity screens per 1,000 people. We used Anselin's Local Moran's I statistic to test for statistically significant census tract-level hot/cold spots of food insecurity. Finally, we utilized a Mann-Whitney-U test to compare hot spot tracts to cold spot tracts in relation to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index. We found that hot spot tracts had higher overall social vulnerability index scores (P <0.001), higher subdomain scores, and higher percentages of individual variables like poverty (P <0.001), unemployment (P <0.001), limited English proficiency (P <0.001), and more.

36939205.0,Dynamic transcriptomic responses to divergent acute exercise stimuli in young adults.,"Acute exercise elicits dynamic transcriptional changes that, when repeated, form the fundamental basis of health, resilience, and performance adaptations. While moderate-intensity endurance training combined with conventional resistance training (traditional, TRAD) is often prescribed and recommended by public health guidance, high-intensity training combining maximal-effort intervals with intensive, limited-rest resistance training is a time-efficient alternative that may be used tactically (HITT) to confer similar benefits. Mechanisms of action of these distinct stimuli are incompletely characterized and have not been directly compared. We assessed transcriptome-wide responses in skeletal muscle and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) to a single exercise bout in young adults randomized to TRAD (<i>n</i> = 21, 12 M/9 F, 22 ± 3 yr) or HITT (<i>n</i> = 19, 11 M/8 F, 22 ± 2 yr). Next-generation sequencing captured small, long, and circular RNA in muscle and EVs. Analysis identified differentially expressed transcripts (|log<sub>2</sub>FC|>1, FDR ≤ 0.05) immediately (h0, EVs only), h3, and h24 postexercise within and between exercise protocols. In aaddition, all apparently responsive transcripts (FDR < 0.2) underwent singular value decomposition to summarize data structures into latent variables (LVs) to deconvolve molecular expression circuits and interregulatory relationships. LVs were compared across time and exercise protocol. TRAD, a longer but less intense stimulus, generally elicited a stronger transcriptional response than HITT, but considerable overlap and key differences existed. Findings reveal shared and unique molecular responses to the exercise stimuli and lay groundwork toward establishing relationships between protein-coding genes and lesser-understood transcripts that serve regulatory roles following exercise. Future work should advance the understanding of these circuits and whether they repeat in other populations or following other types of exercise/stress.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We examined small and long transcriptomics in skeletal muscle and serum-derived extracellular vesicles before and after a single exposure to traditional combined exercise (TRAD) and high-intensity tactical training (HITT). Across 40 young adults, we found more consistent protein-coding gene responses to TRAD, whereas HITT elicited differential expression of microRNA enriched in brain regions.

36958667.0,Methylome changes associated with functional movement/conversion disorder: Influence of biological sex and childhood abuse exposure.,"Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), may represent an important mechanism implicated in the etiopathogenesis of functional movement/conversion disorder (FMD). Here, we aimed to identify methylomic variations in a case-control cohort of FMD and to uncover specific epigenetic signatures associated with female sex and childhood abuse, two key risk factors for FMD and other functional neurological disorders. Genome-wide DNAm analysis was performed from peripheral blood in 57 patients with FMD and 47 healthy controls with and without childhood abuse. Using principal component analysis, we examined the association of principal components with FMD status in abused and non-abused individuals, in the entire study sample and in female subjects only. Next, we used enrichment pathway analysis to investigate the biological significance of DNAm changes and explored differences in methylation levels of genes annotated to the top enriched biological pathways shared across comparisons. We found that FMD was associated with DNAm variation across the genome and identified a common epigenetic 'signature' enriched for biological pathways implicated in chronic stress and chronic pain. However, methylation levels of genes included in the top two shared pathways hardly overlapped, suggesting that transcriptional profiles may differ as a function of childhood abuse exposure and sex among subjects with FMD. This study is unique in providing genome-wide evidence of DNAm changes in FMD and in indicating a potential mechanism linking childhood abuse exposure and female sex to differences in FMD pathophysiology.

Eighty samples matched by age, gender, and race (1:1:1 ratio) for AS patients with active disease, inactive disease, and HC were analyzed with SOMAscan™, an aptamer-based discovery platform. T-tests tests were performed for high/low-disease activity AS patients versus HCs (diagnosis) and high versus low disease activity (Monitoring) in a 2:1 and 1:1 ratio, respectively, to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). We used the Cytoscape Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugin to find clusters in protein-protein interaction networks and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) for upstream regulators. Lasso regression analysis was performed for diagnosis.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 1317 proteins detected in our diagnosis and monitoring analyses, 367 and 167 (317 and 59, FDR-corrected q < .05) DEPs, respectively, were detected. MCODE identified complement, IL-10 signaling, and immune/interleukin signaling as the top 3 diagnosis PPI clusters. Complement, extracellular matrix organization/proteoglycans, and MAPK/RAS signaling were the top 3 monitoring PPI clusters. IPA showed interleukin 23/17 (interleukin 22, interleukin 23A), TNF (TNF receptor-associated factor 3), cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, Stimulator of Interferon Gene 1), and Jak/Stat (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), signaling in predicted upstream regulators. Lasso regression identified a Diagnostic 13-protein model predictive of AS. This model had a sensitivity of 0.75, specificity of 0.90, a kappa of 0.59, and overall accuracy of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.61-0.92). The AS vs HC ROC curve was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.61-0.96).<h4>Conclusion</h4>We identified multiple candidate AS diagnostic and disease activity monitoring serum biomarkers using a comprehensive proteomic screen.

The high degree of variation and diversity in the fungi altered population genetic structure. Therefore, the important factors of variation within the pathogen population should be considered during the development of management strategies for the disease.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, <i>S. rolfsii</i> isolates from 13 hosts in 7 provinces of China were collected and analyzed to identify their morphological features and perform molecular characterization. To develop EST-SSR primers, transcriptome sequencing was performed on isolated CB1, and its SSR loci were comprehensively analyzed. In addition, we analyzed the polymorphisms among different populations based on screened EST-SSR primers.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that all of these clean reads with total 36,165,475 assembled bases were clustered into 28,158 unigenes, ranged from 201 bp to 16,402 bp on the length, of which the average length was 1,284 bp. Of these, the SSR sequence appeared at an average interval of 15.43 kB, and the frequency of SSR was 0.0648 SSR/kB. Polymorphism of 9 primers was observed among 22 populations, and was verified by the Shannon's index (average = 1.414) and polymorphic information index (> 0.50). The genetic diversity analysis revealed diversity in all host populations and geographical populations. Further, molecular variance analysis (AMOVA) showed that the differences between groups were mainly related to geographical location. Based on cluster analysis, the 7 populations were roughly divided into 3 groups, and the results were highly consistent with those based on the geographical location, ultimately aligning with the results of STRUCTURE analysis.<h4>Discussion</h4>The findings build on current knowledge of the distribution of <i>S. rolfsii</i> in the southwest area of China, adding value to current knowledge base on the population structure and genetic diversity of <i>S. rolfsii</i>, specifically in the context of Chinese herbal medicine cultivation in China. Overall, our findings may provide valuable information for breeding of crops with enhanced resistance toward <i>S. rolfsii</i>.",not-bio-resource,0.99831164,0,1,0.7466,1,1,37323912,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3

Weak annotation has emerged as a way to save time and effort.<h4>Purpose</h4>To develop a deep learning model for 3D breast cancer segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using weak annotation with reliable performance.<h4>Study type</h4>Retrospective.<h4>Population</h4>Seven hundred and thirty-six women with breast cancer from a single institution, divided into the development (N = 544) and test dataset (N = 192).<h4>Field strength/sequence</h4>3.0-T, 3D fat-saturated gradient-echo axial T1-weighted flash 3D volumetric interpolated brain examination (VIBE) sequences.<h4>Assessment</h4>Two radiologists performed a weak annotation of the ground truth using bounding boxes. Based on this, the ground truth annotation was completed through autonomic and manual correction. The deep learning model using 3D U-Net transformer (UNETR) was trained with this annotated dataset. The segmentation results of the test set were analyzed by quantitative and qualitative methods, and the regions were divided into whole breast and region of interest (ROI) within the bounding box.<h4>Statistical tests</h4>As a quantitative method, we used the Dice similarity coefficient to evaluate the segmentation result. The volume correlation with the ground truth was evaluated with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Qualitatively, three readers independently evaluated the visual score in four scales. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>The deep learning model we developed achieved a median Dice similarity score of 0.75 and 0.89 for the whole breast and ROI, respectively. The volume correlation coefficient with respect to the ground truth volume was 0.82 and 0.86 for the whole breast and ROI, respectively.

37610812.0,Improving Surveillance of Human Tick-Borne Disease Risks: Spatial Analysis Using Multimodal Databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>The extent of tick-borne disease (TBD) risk in the United States is generally unknown. Active surveillance using entomological measures, such as presence and density of infected nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks, have served as indicators for assessing human risk, but results have been inconsistent and passive surveillance via public health systems suggests TBDs are underreported.<h4>Objective</h4>Research using various data sources and collection methods (eg, Google Trends, apps, and tick bite encounters [TBEs] reports) has shown promise for assessing human TBD risk. In that vein, and engaging a One Health perspective, this study used multimodal databases, geographically overlaying patient survey data on TBEs and concomitant reports of TBDs with data drawn from other sources, such as canine serological reports, to glean insights and to determine and assess the use of various indicators as proxies for human TBD risk.<h4>Methods</h4>This study used a mixed methods research strategy, relying on triangulation techniques and drawing on multiple data sources to provide insights into various aspects of human disease risk from TBEs and TBDs in the United States. A web-based survey was conducted over a 15-month period beginning in December 2020 to collect data on TBEs. To maximize the value of the covariate data, related analyses included TBE reports that occurred in the United States between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2021. TBEs among patients diagnosed with Lyme disease were analyzed at the county level and compared to I scapularis and I pacificus tick presence, human cases identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and canine serological data. Spatial analyses employed multilayer thematic mapping and other techniques.<h4>Results</h4>After cleaning, survey results showed a total of 249 (75.7%) TBEs spread across 148 respondents (61.9% of all respondents, 81.7% of TBE-positive respondents); 144 (4.7%) counties in 30 states (60%) remained eligible for analysis, with an average of 1.68 (SD 1.00) and median of 1 (IQR 1) TBEs per respondent. Analysis revealed significant spatial matching at the county level among patient survey reports of TBEs and disease risk indicators from the CDC and other official sources. Thematic mapping results included one-for-one county-level matching of reported TBEs with at least 1 designated source of human disease risk (ie, positive canine serological tests, CDC-reported Lyme disease, or known tick presence).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Use of triangulation methods to integrate patient data on TBE recall with established canine serological reports, tick presence, and official human TBD information offers more granular, county-level information regarding TBD risk to inform clinicians and public health officials. Such data may supplement public health sources to offer improved surveillance and provide bases for developing robust proxies for TBD risk among humans.",not-bio-resource,0.99873453,0,1,0.5776,1,1,37610812,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3

Audiological outcomes were compared between patients who received CRT prior to PCth and those who received it afterwards. The incidence, degree and posttreatment progression of SNHL, defined as Muenster classification grade ≥MS2b, were evaluated in 141 patients. One hundred and nineteen patients were included in a time-to-onset analysis. Eighty-eight patients received CRT prior to PCth (Group 1) and 53 patients received PCth before CRT (Group 2). Over a median follow-up time of 1.6 years, 72.7% of patients in Group 1 experienced SNHL ≥ MS2b compared to 33.9% in Group 2 (P < .01). A time-to-onset analysis was performed for 74 patients from Group 1 and 45 patients from Group 2. Median time to hearing loss (HL) ≥ MS2b was 1.2 years in Group 1 and 4.4 years in Group 2 (P < .01). Thus, audiological outcomes were better for patients who received CRT after PCth than before. This finding should be further evaluated and considered within clinical practice in order to minimize hearing loss in children and adolescents with CNS and HN tumors.",not-bio-resource,0.9990363,0,1,0.7466,1,1,37715472,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
37963966.0,Emerging infectious disease surveillance using a hierarchical diagnosis model and the Knox algorithm.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a critical public health challenge in the twenty-first century. The recent proliferation of such diseases has raised major social and economic concerns. Therefore, early detection of emerging infectious diseases is essential. Subjects from five medical institutions in Beijing, China, which met the spatial-specific requirements, were analyzed. A quality control process was used to select 37,422 medical records of infectious diseases and 56,133 cases of non-infectious diseases. An emerging infectious disease detection model (EIDDM), a two-layer model that divides the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., whether a case is an infectious disease, and if so, whether it is a known infectious disease, was proposed. The first layer model adopts the binary classification model TextCNN-Attention. The second layer is a multi-classification model of LightGBM based on the one-vs-rest strategy. Based on the experimental results, a threshold of 0.5 is selected. The model results were compared with those of other models such as XGBoost and Random Forest using the following evaluation indicators: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The prediction performance of the first-layer TextCNN is better than that of other comparison models. Its average specificity for non-infectious diseases is 97.57%, with an average negative predictive value of 82.63%, indicating a low risk of misdiagnosing non-infectious diseases as infectious (i.e., a low false positive rate). Its average positive predictive value for eight selected infectious diseases is 95.07%, demonstrating the model's ability to avoid misdiagnoses. The overall average accuracy of the model is 86.11%. The average prediction accuracy of the second-layer LightGBM model for emerging infectious diseases reaches 90.44%. Furthermore, the response time of a single online reasoning using the LightGBM model is approximately 27 ms, which makes it suitable for analyzing clinical records in real time. Using the Knox method, we found that all the infectious diseases were within 2000 m in our case, and a clustering feature of spatiotemporal interactions (P < 0.05) was observed as well. Performance testing and model comparison results indicated that the EIDDM is fast and accurate and can be used to monitor the onset/outbreak of emerging infectious diseases in real-world hospitals.",not-bio-resource,0.9989427,0,1,0.7466,1,1,37963966,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
38227561.0,Suicide attempt and death by suicide among parents of young individuals with cancer: A population-based study in Denmark and Sweden.,"<h4>Background</h4>The psychological toll on parents of a child receiving a cancer diagnosis is known to be high, but there is a knowledge gap regarding suicidal behavior among these parents. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of suicide attempt and death by suicide in relation to having a child with cancer.<h4>Methods and findings</h4>We performed a binational population-based and sibling-controlled cohort study, including all parents with a child diagnosed with cancer in Denmark (1978 to 2016) or Sweden (1973 to 2014), 10 matched unexposed parents per exposed parent (population comparison), and unaffected full siblings of the exposed parents (sibling comparison). Suicide attempt was identified through the Patient Register and the Psychiatric Central Register in Denmark and the Patient Register in Sweden, whereas death by suicide was identified through the Danish Causes of Death Register and the Swedish Causes of Death Register. In population comparison, we used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of suicide attempt and death by suicide associated with cancer diagnosis of a child, adjusting for sex, age, country of residence, calendar year, marital status, highest attained educational level, household income, history of cancer, history of psychiatric disorder, and family history of psychiatric disorder. The sibling comparison was performed to assess the role of familial confounding in the studied associations. The population comparison consisted of 106,005 exposed parents and 1,060,050 matched unexposed parents, with a median age of 56 at cohort entry and 46.9% male. During the median follow-up of 7.3 and 7.2 years, we observed 613 (incidence rate [IR], 58.8 per 100,000 person-years) and 5,888 (IR, 57.1 per 100,000 person-years) cases of first-onset suicide attempt among the exposed and unexposed parents, respectively. There was an increased risk of parental suicide attempt during the first years after a child's cancer diagnosis (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, [1.03, 1.28]; p = 0.01), particularly when the child was 18 or younger at diagnosis (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, [1.08, 1.46]; p = 0.004), when the child was diagnosed with a highly aggressive cancer (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, [1.05, 2.43]; p = 0.03), or when the child died due to cancer (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, [1.29, 2.06]; p < 0.001). The increased risk did not, however, maintain thereafter (HR, 0.86; 95% CI: [0.75, 0.98]; p = 0.03), and there was no altered risk of parental death by suicide any time after the child's cancer diagnosis. Sibling comparison corroborated these findings. The main limitation of the study is the potential residual confounding by factors not shared between full siblings.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, we observed an increased risk of parental suicide attempt during the first years after a child's cancer diagnosis, especially when the child was diagnosed during childhood, or with an aggressive or fatal form of cancer. There was, however, no altered risk of parental death by suicide at any time after a child's cancer diagnosis. Our findings suggest extended clinical awareness of suicide attempt among parents of children with cancer, especially during the first few years after cancer diagnosis.",not-bio-resource,0.9989618,0,1,0.7466,1,1,38227561,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
38788463.0,Colon Cancer Survival Among South Asian Americans: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of a National Dataset.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Colon cancer (CC) is one of the most common cancers among South Asian Americans (SAAs). The objective of this study was to measure differences in risk-adjusted survival among SAAs with CC compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) using a representative national dataset from the United States.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis of patients with CC in the National Cancer Database (2004-2020) was performed. Differences in presentation, management, median overall survival (OS), three-year survival, and five-year survival between SAAs and NHWs were compared. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression were used to assess differences in survival outcomes, adjusting for demographics, presentation, and treatments received.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 2873 SAA and 639,488 NHW patients with CC were analyzed. SAAs were younger at diagnosis (62.2 versus 69.5 y, P < 0.001), higher stage (stage III [29.0% versus 26.2%, P = 0.001] or Stage IV [21.4% versus 20.0%, P = 0.001]), and experienced delays to first treatment (SAA 5.9% versus 4.9%, P = 0.003). SAAs with CC had higher OS (median not achieved versus 68.1 mo for NHWs), three-year survival (76.3% versus 63.4%), and five-year survival (69.1% versus 52.9%). On multivariable Cox regression, SAAs with CC had a lower risk of death across all stages (hazard ratio: 0.64, P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this national study, SAA patients with CC presented earlier in life with more advanced disease, and a higher proportion experienced treatment delay compared to NHW patients. Despite these differences, SAAs had better adjusted OS than NHW, warranting further exploration of tumor biology and socioeconomic determinants of cancer outcomes in SAAs.",not-bio-resource,0.99902165,0,1,0.7466,1,1,38788463,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
38811951.0,Plasma proteome association with coronary heart disease and carotid intima media thickness: results from the KORA F4 study.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>Atherosclerosis is the main cause of stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD), both leading mortality causes worldwide. Proteomics, as a high-throughput method, could provide helpful insights into the pathological mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. In this study, we characterized the associations of plasma protein levels with CHD and with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), as a surrogate measure of atherosclerosis.<h4>Methods</h4>The discovery phase included 1000 participants from the KORA F4 study, whose plasma protein levels were quantified using the aptamer-based SOMAscan proteomics platform. We evaluated the associations of plasma protein levels with CHD using logistic regression, and with CIMT using linear regression. For both outcomes we applied two models: an age-sex adjusted model, and a model additionally adjusted for body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, diabetes status, hypertension status, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels (fully-adjusted model). The replication phase included a matched case-control sample from the independent KORA F3 study, using ELISA-based measurements of galectin-4. Pathway analysis was performed with nominally associated proteins (p-value < 0.05) from the fully-adjusted model.<h4>Results</h4>In the KORA F4 sample, after Bonferroni correction, we found CHD to be associated with five proteins using the age-sex adjusted model: galectin-4 (LGALS4), renin (REN), cathepsin H (CTSH), and coagulation factors X and Xa (F10). The fully-adjusted model yielded only the positive association of galectin-4 (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.30-1.93), which was successfully replicated in the KORA F3 sample (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.09-1.88). For CIMT, we found four proteins to be associated using the age-sex adjusted model namely: cytoplasmic protein NCK1 (NCK1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), growth hormone receptor (GHR), and GDNF family receptor alpha-1 (GFRA1). After assessing the fully-adjusted model, only NCK1 remained significant (β = 0.017, p-value = 1.39e-06). Upstream regulators of galectin-4 and NCK1 identified from pathway analysis were predicted to be involved in inflammation pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our proteome-wide association study identified galectin-4 to be associated with CHD and NCK1 to be associated with CIMT. Inflammatory pathways underlying the identified associations highlight the importance of inflammation in the development and progression of CHD.",not-bio-resource,0.9990615,0,1,0.7466,1,1,38811951,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
39008834.0,Factors Associated With Continuous Use of a Cancer Education Metaverse Platform: Mixed Methods Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Early detection of cancer and provision of appropriate treatment can increase the cancer cure rate and reduce cancer-related deaths. Early detection requires improving the cancer screening quality of each medical institution and enhancing the capabilities of health professionals through tailored education in each field. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, regional disparities in educational infrastructure emerged, and educational accessibility was restricted. The demand for remote cancer education services to address these issues has increased, and in this study, we considered medical metaverses as a potential means of meeting these needs. In 2022, we used Metaverse Educational Center, developed for the virtual training of health professionals, to train radiologic technologists remotely in mammography positioning.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aims to investigate the user experience of the Metaverse Educational Center subplatform and the factors associated with the intention for continuous use by focusing on cases of using the subplatform in a remote mammography positioning training project.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional survey between July and December 2022. We performed a descriptive analysis to examine the Metaverse Educational Center user experience and a logistic regression analysis to clarify factors closely related to the intention to use the subplatform continuously. In addition, a supplementary open-ended question was used to obtain feedback from users to improve Metaverse Educational Center.<h4>Results</h4>Responses from 192 Korean participants (male participants: n=16, 8.3%; female participants: n=176, 91.7%) were analyzed. Most participants were satisfied with Metaverse Educational Center (178/192, 92.7%) and wanted to continue using the subplatform in the future (157/192, 81.8%). Less than half of the participants (85/192, 44.3%) had no difficulty in wearing the device. Logistic regression analysis results showed that intention for continuous use was associated with satisfaction (adjusted odds ratio 3.542, 95% CI 1.037-12.097; P=.04), immersion (adjusted odds ratio 2.803, 95% CI 1.201-6.539; P=.02), and no difficulty in wearing the device (adjusted odds ratio 2.020, 95% CI 1.004-4.062; P=.049). However, intention for continuous use was not associated with interest (adjusted odds ratio 0.736, 95% CI 0.303-1.789; P=.50) or perceived ease of use (adjusted odds ratio 1.284, 95% CI 0.614-2.685; P=.51). According to the qualitative feedback, Metaverse Educational Center was useful in cancer education, but the experience of wearing the device and the types and qualities of the content still need to be improved.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results demonstrate the positive user experience of Metaverse Educational Center by focusing on cases of using the subplatform in a remote mammography positioning training project. Our results also suggest that improving users' satisfaction and immersion and ensuring the lack of difficulty in wearing the device may enhance their intention for continuous use of the subplatform.",not-bio-resource,0.99905854,0,1,0.7466,1,1,39008834,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3

The aim of this study was to carry out a comparative quantitative analysis of the research material on the topic in one established database, Scopus and another emerging database, Dimensions.<h4>Method</h4>An electronic search was performed in Scopus and Dimensions in April 2024 with the search subjects ""Saliva,"" ""Biomarkers,"" ""Diagnosis,"" and ""Oral Cancer."" The retrieved data were analyzed using Biblioshiny for RStudio and MS Excel.<h4>Result</h4>The search yielded 229 and 158 documents in Scopus and Dimensions, respectively. The data were studied to understand the coverage, concentration, and diversion of research articles. The analysis revealed high singularity index for Scopus and low overlap percentage between the two databases. Scopus was found to have higher citation count per article, however, the citation correlation between Scopus and Dimensions was found to be strong. Author productivity was found to be low in both the databases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Scopus and Dimensions vary in their scope, volume of data, and coverage policies. Both the databases have complimentary coverage on salivary biomarkers for oral cancer diagnosis.

39192421.0,[The Causes of Platelet Aggregation in Version 6.4 Trima Accel Automated Blood Collection System and the Comparison of Two Intervention Measures].,"<h4>Objective</h4>To explore the causes of platelet aggregation in version 6.4 Trima Accel automated blood collection system and the effect of 2 intervention measures.<h4>Methods</h4>The data on platelet aggregation (<i>n</i>=61) and non-aggregation (<i>n</i>=323) of 61 donors in 2020 were collected and the causes of aggregation were analyzed. Then the 72 donors with platelet aggregation in 2021 were randomized into intervention group A (increasing the anticoagulant-to-blood ratio) and intervention group B (wrapping the donor's arm with an electric blanket to keep warm and improve the blood flow speed). The collection time, average blood flow speed, number of machine alarms, anticoagulant usage, deaggregation and citrate reaction of the two groups were compared.<h4>Results</h4>Platelet aggregation was negatively correlated with the average blood flow speed (<i>r</i> =-0.394) and positively correlated with the collection time (<i>r</i> =0.458). The equations for predicting aggregation and non-aggregation were constructed based on Bayesian and Fisher discriminant analysis, and the predicted accuracy was 77.1%. The comparison of the effects of two intervention measures showed that the average blood flow speed in group B was higher than that in group A; the collection time, number of machine alarms, anticoagulant usage and proportion of citrate reaction in blood donors in group B were all lower than those in Group A, all these differences were significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In the entire cohort in 2021, 90.28% of the products were immediately deaggregated after collection, and 9.72% of the products were deaggregated within 4 hours. There was no statistically significant difference in deaggregation between the two intervention groups (<i>P</i> >0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>During apheresis platelet collection, the predictive equations for aggregation and non-aggregation can be used to predict the occurrence probability of aggregation, and the intervention can be made in advance. Both intervention measures are effective in reducing platelet aggregation, however, measure B has the advantages of improving the speed of blood collection, shortening the collection time, reducing the alarm frequency and the anticoagulant usage, and reducing the incidence of citrate reaction in blood donors.",not-bio-resource,0.99898773,0,1,0.7466,1,1,39192421,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
39694151.0,Large language models can accurately populate Vascular Quality Initiative procedural databases using narrative operative reports.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Participation in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) provides important resources to surgeons, but the ability to do so is often limited by time and data entry personnel. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) are examples of generative artificial intelligence products that may help bridge this gap. Trained on large volumes of data, the models are used for natural language processing and text generation. We evaluated the ability of LLMs to accurately populate VQI procedural databases using operative reports.<h4>Methods</h4>A single-center, retrospective study was performed using institutional VQI data from 2021 to 2023. The most recent procedures for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and infrainguinal lower extremity bypass (LEB) were analyzed using Versa, a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant institutional version of ChatGPT. We created an automated function to analyze operative reports and generate a shareable VQI file using two models: gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4. Application of the LLMs was accomplished with a cloud-based programming interface. The outputs of this model were compared with VQI data for accuracy. We defined a metric as ""unavailable"" to the LLM if it was discussed by surgeons in <20% of operative reports.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 150 operative notes were analyzed, including 50 CEA, 50 EVAR, and 50 LEB. These procedural VQI databases included 25, 179, and 51 metrics, respectively. For all fields, gpt-35-turbo had a median accuracy of 84.0% for CEA (interquartile range [IQR]: 80.0%-88.0%), 92.2% for EVAR (IQR: 87.2%-94.0%), and 84.3% for LEB (IQR: 80.2%-88.1%). A total of 3 of 25, 6 of 179, and 7 of 51 VQI variables were unavailable in the operative reports, respectively. Excluding metric information routinely unavailable in operative reports, the median accuracy rate was 95.5% for each CEA procedure (IQR: 90.9%-100.0%), 94.8% for EVAR (IQR: 92.2%-98.5%), and 93.2% for LEB (IQR: 90.2%-96.4%). Across procedures, gpt-4 did not meaningfully improve performance compared with gpt-35 (P = .97, .85, and .95 for CEA, EVAR, and LEB overall performance, respectively). The cost for 150 operative reports analyzed with gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4 was $0.12 and $3.39, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LLMs can accurately populate VQI procedural databases with both structured and unstructured data, while incurring only minor processing costs. Increased workflow efficiency may improve center ability to successfully participate in the VQI. Further work examining other VQI databases and methods to increase accuracy is needed.",not-bio-resource,0.9985366,0,1,0.7466,1,1,39694151,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3

The 22 isolates were randomly selected and subject to WGS determination. The genomes measured 1.991-2.517 Mbp, with G + C contents of 35.8-36.9%. We used ResFinder-ICEfinder (web-based applications) to search for the antimicrobial resistant genes and ICEs. ResFinder detected combined erm(B)-tet(O)-ant(6)-Ia at the identical contig in each WGS. ICEfinder detected ICEs belonging to the same contigs, which contained erm(B)-tet(O)-ant(6)-Ia complete or partial sequences. Detection of putative ICEs using comparative genomic analysis was performed with identification of other streptococcal ICE resembling S. uberis ICEs. Using comparative genomic analysis (a reference WGS in NZ01 strain), putative ICE base size in UB37 isolate was 77,386-bp that was identical in other 13 isolates. Another similar streptococcal ICE was S. suis ICEnsui78-tet(O)-erm(B) mobile element.

39911068.0,Evaluation of VLA-4 (Integrin α4β1) as a Shared Target for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy across Solid Tumors.,"Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) is a promising approach to treating solid tumors, but therapeutic advances are impeded by the lack of broadly expressed targets and shared molecular vulnerability across different tumor types. Here, we evaluate VLA-4 (integrin α4β1) as a potential target for RPT in solid tumors and use radiolabeled copper-64 ([64Cu]Cu-) and copper-67 ([67Cu]Cu-CB-TE1A1P-PEG4-LLP2A) LLP2A, a peptidomimetic ligand of VLA-4, for preclinical imaging and RPT testing. Expression of ITGA4, the gene encoding the alpha 4 subunit (CD49d) of VLA-4, was evaluated in a variety of cancer tissues from publicly available datasets. VLA-4 protein expression was determined by flow cytometry in 22 different human and murine cancer cell lines. We used orthotopic syngeneic (i.e., B16-F10, B78, 4T1, GL261, TH-MYCN, and E2A-PBX1) and human (i.e., SK-MEL-37, 143B, and IMR-5) cancer models for in vivo PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies. Selected models were used for dosimetry calculations with [64Cu]Cu-LLP2A. To assess in vivo tolerability and efficacy, we performed studies of [67Cu]Cu-LLP2A in tumor-free and B16-F10-bearing C57BL/6J mice (activity range, 0-74 MBq [0-2 mCi]), respectively. We found ITGA4 is overexpressed in hematological malignancies and a variety of solid tumors compared with healthy tissue. VLA-4 was expressed at medium to high levels in 17/22 (77%), at low levels in 4/22 (18%), and negative in 1/22 (5%) tested cell lines. PET/CT imaging with [64Cu]Cu-LLP2A showed tracer uptake in tumors and on-target off-tumor uptake in lymphoid tissues. [67Cu]Cu-LLP2A administered at an activity range of 37 to 74 MBq (1-2 mCi) was tolerated and did not cause long-term hematological or tissue toxicity, except for thymic atrophy. We observed tumor dose response to the activity administered to mice with B16-F10 melanoma. In summary, VLA-4 is broadly expressed across a variety of different cancer tissues and preclinical cancer cell lines, making it a promising target for [67Cu]Cu-LLP2A RPT. With proven on-target on-tumor effect, acceptable toxicity profile, and favorable dosimetry in preclinical models, further investigation of [67Cu]Cu-LLP2A as an RPT agent is warranted.",not-bio-resource,0.9984856,0,1,0.7466,1,1,39911068,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
39978248.0,Accuracy of cephalometric landmark identification by artificial intelligence platform versus expert orthodontist in unilateral cleft palate patients: A retrospective study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of automated artificial intelligence (AI) cephalometric landmark identification in cleft patients and compare it to landmarks identified by an expert orthodontist. The secondary objective was to compare cephalometric measurements obtained by both methods.<h4>Material and methods</h4>A total of 112 pre-treatment lateral cephalometric radiographs of unilateral cleft palate patients were collected from the archives of the Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University following screening of all the records of patients treated in the period January 2019-December 2022 for eligibility. For each of the acquired radiographs, cephalometric tracing was performed by fully automated WebCeph™ landmark detection process and by manual identification of the landmarks by an expert orthodontist using OnyxCeph™ software. The traced radiographs were then imported into Photoshop software for evaluation of the (x,y) coordinates, in mm, for each of the identified landmarks (Primary outcome). Moreover, linear and angular measurements generated using WebCeph™ and OnyxCeph™ software were compared (secondary outcomes).<h4>Results</h4>The coordinates of A-point, ANS, and Or showed statistically significant differences between both identification methods, with a mean difference between the two methods ranging between -0.86mm±2.15 and 3.15mm±6.07. None of the dental landmarks showed statistically significant differences between the two methods. None of the soft tissue landmarks showed statistically significant differences, except Ns y-coordinate. Several points showed clinically significant differences between both methods. The greatest mean differences in cephalometric measurements between the two methods were reported in nasolabial angle CotgSnLs (18.3±22.77̊) followed by Max1-NA (-8.86±17.46̊) and Max1-SN (-8.43±12.51̊).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The identification of cephalometric landmarks in cleft palate patients using the web-based AI platform is not as accurate as manual identification.

40096161.0,Circ_0022587 Regulates Tumor Properties of Human Breast Cancer Cells by Targeting miR-335-5p/Phosphoglycerate Kinase 1 Pathway.,"Increasing research indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) affect the development of breast cancer (BC) through specific molecular mechanisms. However, there is no data regarding the role of circ_0022587 in BC progression. This investigation aims to reveal the mechanism of circ_0022587 in regulating the malignant progression of BC. The study recruited 27 BC patients undergoing a surgical operation in Nantong First People's Hospital, Affiliated Hospital 2 of Nantong University. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and RNase R degradation assay were used to verify the circular structure of circ_0022587. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, flow cytometry analysis, transwell and tube formation assays were used to detect the viability, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and tumor angiogenesis of BC cells, respectively. Glycolysis was evaluated by glycolysis metabolism assays. The associations among miR-335-5p, circ_0022587 and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) were identified by dual-luciferase reporter assays and RNA immunoprecipitation. The effects of circ_0022587 knockdown on tumor growth were evaluated by xenograft nude mouse model assays. The positive expression rates of PGK1, nuclear proliferation marker and matrix metalloprotein 9 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry assays. The results showed that circ_0022587 expression was upregulated in BC tumor tissues and BC cells. Downregulation of circ_0022587 inhibited cell viability, proliferation, invasion ability, tube angiogenesis and glycolysis, and promoted cell apoptosis. Overexpression of circ_0022587 relieved the effect of glycolysis inhibitor (2-Deoxy-D-glucose, 2-DG) on glucose consumption, lactate production, and ATP/ADP ratios. In addition, circ_0022587 interacted with miR-335-5p, and miR-335-5p inhibitors attenuated circ_0022587 silencing-induced effects in BC cells. miR-335-5p bound to PGK1, and PGK1 overexpression relieved miR-335-5p mimics-induced effects in BC cells. Further, circ_0022587 knockdown inhibited tumor formation in vivo. The above results demonstrate that circ_0022587 regulates PGK1 expression by absorbing miR-335-5p, thereby affecting BC development, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for BC. The study's novelty and innovative potential lie in its discovery of a new regulatory mechanism involving circ_0022587 in the miR-335-5p/PGK1 pathway and its potential clinical relevance. These aspects contribute to the expanding knowledge base of breast cancer research and could potentially lead to improved therapeutic strategies in the future.",not-bio-resource,0.9983741,0,1,0.7466,1,1,40096161,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
40209205.0,Large Language Models in Biochemistry Education: Comparative Evaluation of Performance.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs), have started a new era of innovation across various fields, with medicine at the forefront of this technological revolution. Many studies indicated that at the current level of development, LLMs can pass different board exams. However, the ability to answer specific subject-related questions requires validation.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis comparing the performance of advanced LLM chatbots-Claude (Anthropic), GPT-4 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft)-against the academic results of medical students in the medical biochemistry course.<h4>Methods</h4>We used 200 USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination)-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) selected from the course exam database. They encompassed various complexity levels and were distributed across 23 distinctive topics. The questions with tables and images were not included in the study. The results of 5 successive attempts by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4-1106, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Copilot to answer this questionnaire set were evaluated based on accuracy in August 2024. Statistica 13.5.0.17 (TIBCO Software Inc) was used to analyze the data's basic statistics. Considering the binary nature of the data, the chi-square test was used to compare results among the different chatbots, with a statistical significance level of P<.05.<h4>Results</h4>On average, the selected chatbots correctly answered 81.1% (SD 12.8%) of the questions, surpassing the students' performance by 8.3% (P=.02). In this study, Claude showed the best performance in biochemistry MCQs, correctly answering 92.5% (185/200) of questions, followed by GPT-4 (170/200, 85%), Gemini (157/200, 78.5%), and Copilot (128/200, 64%). The chatbots demonstrated the best results in the following 4 topics: eicosanoids (mean 100%, SD 0%), bioenergetics and electron transport chain (mean 96.4%, SD 7.2%), hexose monophosphate pathway (mean 91.7%, SD 16.7%), and ketone bodies (mean 93.8%, SD 12.5%). The Pearson chi-square test indicated a statistically significant association between the answers of all 4 chatbots (P<.001 to P<.04).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study suggests that different AI models may have unique strengths in specific medical fields, which could be leveraged for targeted support in biochemistry courses. This performance highlights the potential of AI in medical education and assessment.",not-bio-resource,0.99867755,0,1,0.7466,1,1,40209205,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
40375066.0,A multi-tissue and -breed catalogue of chromatin conformations and their implications in gene regulation in pigs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Topologically associating domains (TADs) are functional units that organize chromosomes into 3D structures of interacting chromatin, and play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by constraining enhancer-promoter contacts. Evidence suggests that deletion of TAD boundaries can lead to aberrant expression of neighboring genes. In our study, we analyzed high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) datasets from publicly available sources, integrating 71 datasets across five tissues in six pig breeds.<h4>Results</h4>Our comprehensive analysis revealed 65,843 TADs in pigs, and we found that TAD boundaries are enriched for expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (sQTL), Loss-of-Function variants (LoFs), and other regulatory variants. Genes within conserved TADs are associated with fundamental biological functions, while those in dynamic TADs may have tissue-specific roles. Specifically, we observed differential expression of the NCOA2 gene within dynamic TADs. This gene is highly expressed in adipose tissue, where it plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism and maintaining energy homeostasis. Additionally, differential expression of the BMPER gene within dynamic TADs is associated with its role in modulating the activities of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)-critical growth factors involved in bone and cartilage development.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our investigations have shed light on the pivotal roles of TADs in governing gene expression and even influencing traits. Our study has unveiled a holistic interplay between chromatin interactions and gene regulation across various tissues and pig breeds. Furthermore, we anticipate that incorporating markers, such as structural variants (SVs), and phenotypes will enhance our understanding of their intricate interactions.",not-bio-resource,0.92242354,0,1,0.7466,1,1,40375066,-1.5,usage_kw=3,False,False,False,0,3
