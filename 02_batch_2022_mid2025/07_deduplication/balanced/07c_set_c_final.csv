37789571,Analyzing the cation-aromatic interactions in proteins: Cation-aromatic database V2.0.,"The cation-aromatic database (CAD) is a comprehensive repository of cation-aromatic motifs found in experimentally determined protein structures, first reported in 2007 [Proteins, 2007, 67, 1179]. The present article is an update of CAD that contains information of approximately 27.26 million cation-aromatic motifs. CAD uses three distance parameters (r, d1, and d2) to determine the position of the cation relative to the centroid of the aromatic residue and classifies the motifs as cation-π or cation-σ interactions. As of June 2023, about 193 936 protein structures were retrieved from Protein Data Bank, and this resulted in the identification of an impressive number of 27 255 817 cation-aromatic motifs. Among these motifs, spherical motifs constituted 94.09%, while cylindrical motifs made up the remaining 5.91%. When considering the interaction of metal ions with aromatic residues, 965 564 motifs are identified. Remarkably, 82.08% of these motifs involved the binding of metal ions to the amino acid HIS. Moreover, the analysis of binding preferences between cations and aromatic residues revealed that the HIS-HIS, PHE-ARG, and TRP-ARG pairs exhibited a preferential geometry. The motif pair HIS-HIS was the most prevalent, accounting for 19.87% of the total, closely followed by TYR-LYS at 10.17%. Conversely, the motif pair TRP-HIS had the lowest occurrence, representing only 4.20% of the total. The data generated help in revealing the characteristics and biological functions of cation-aromatic interactions in biological molecules.

36040109,G-DIRT: a web server for identification and removal of duplicate germplasms based on identity-by-state analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping data.,"Maintaining duplicate germplasms in genebanks hampers effective conservation and utilization of genebank resources. The redundant germplasm adds to the cost of germplasm conservation by requiring a large proportion of the genebank financial resources towards conservation rather than enriching the diversity. Besides, genome-wide-association analysis using an association panel with over-represented germplasms can be biased resulting in spurious marker-trait associations. The conventional methods of germplasm duplicate removal using passport information suffer from incomplete or missing passport information and data handling errors at various stages of germplasm enrichment. This limitation is less likely in the case of genotypic data. Therefore, we developed a web-based tool, Germplasm Duplicate Identification and Removal Tool (G-DIRT), which allows germplasm duplicate identification based on identity-by-state analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping information along with pre-processing of genotypic data. A homozygous genotypic difference threshold of 0.1% for germplasm duplicates has been determined using tetraploid wheat genotypic data with 94.97% of accuracy. Based on the genotypic difference, the tool also builds a dendrogram that can visually depict the relationship between genotypes. To overcome the constraint of high-dimensional genotypic data, an offline version of G-DIRT in the interface of R has also been developed. The G-DIRT is expected to help genebank curators, breeders and other researchers across the world in identifying germplasm duplicates from the global genebank collections by only using the easily sharable genotypic data instead of physically exchanging the seeds or propagating materials.

35148171,Genome Nexus: A Comprehensive Resource for the Annotation and Interpretation of Genomic Variants in Cancer.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Interpretation of genomic variants in tumor samples still presents a challenge in research and the clinical setting. A major issue is that information for variant interpretation is fragmented across disparate databases, and aggregation of information from these requires building extensive infrastructure. To this end, we have developed Genome Nexus, a one-stop shop for variant annotation with a user-friendly interface for cancer researchers and clinicians.<h4>Methods</h4>Genome Nexus (1) aggregates variant information from sources that are relevant to cancer research and clinical applications, (2) allows high-performance programmatic access to the aggregated data via a unified application programming interface, (3) provides a reference page for individual cancer variants, (4) provides user-friendly tools for annotating variants in patients, and (5) is freely available under an open source license and can be installed in a private cloud or local environment and integrated with local institutional resources.<h4>Results</h4>Genome Nexus is available at https://www.genomenexus.org. It displays annotations from more than a dozen resources including those that provide variant effect information (variant effect predictor), protein sequence annotation (Uniprot, Pfam, and dbPTM), functional consequence prediction (Polyphen-2, Mutation Assessor, and SIFT), population prevalences (gnomAD, dbSNP, and ExAC), cancer population prevalences (Cancer hotspots and SignalDB), and clinical actionability (OncoKB, CIViC, and ClinVar). We describe several use cases that demonstrate the utility of Genome Nexus to clinicians, researchers, and bioinformaticians. We cover single-variant annotation, cohort analysis, and programmatic use of the application programming interface. Genome Nexus is unique in providing a user-friendly interface specific to cancer that allows high-performance annotation of any variant including unknown ones.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Interpretation of cancer genomic variants is improved tremendously by having an integrated resource for annotations.

37114214,EccBase: A high-quality database for exploration and characterization of extrachromosomal circular DNAs in cancer.,"Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are widely observed in eukaryotes. Previous studies have demonstrated that eccDNAs are essential to cancer progression, and found that they can not only express in normal cells to regulate RNA, but also function differently in different tissues. It is of major interest to conduct computational or experiments assay to elucidate the mechanisms of eccDNA function, uncover key eccDNAs associated with diseases, and even develop related algorithms for liquid biopsy. Naturally, a comprehensive eccDNAs data resource is urgently needed to provide annotation and analysis more in-depth research. In this study, we constructed the eccBase (http://www.eccbase.net) in literature curation and database retrieval, which was the first database mainly collecting eccDNAs from Homo sapiens (n = 754,391) and Mus musculus (n = 481,381). Homo sapiens eccDNAs were taken from 50 kinds of cancer tissue and/or cell line, and 5 kinds of healthy tissues. The Mus musculus eccDNAs were sourced from 13 kinds of healthy tissue and/or cell line. We thoroughly annotated all eccDNA molecules in terms of basic information, genomic composition, regulatory elements, epigenetic modifications, and raw data. EccBase provided users with the ability to browse, search, download for targets of interest, as well as similarity alignment by the integrated BLAST. Further, comparative analysis suggested the cancer eccDNA is composed of nucleosomes and is prominently derived from the gene-dense regions. We also initially revealed that eccDNAs are strongly tissue-specific.

The DISEASES database aims to provide a comprehensive overview by systematically integrating and assigning confidence scores to evidence for disease-gene associations from curated databases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and automatic text mining of the biomedical literature. Here, we present a major update to this resource, which greatly increases the number of associations from all these sources. This is especially true for the text-mined associations, which have increased by at least 9-fold at all confidence cutoffs. We show that this dramatic increase is primarily due to adding full-text articles to the text corpus, secondarily due to improvements to both the disease and gene dictionaries used for named entity recognition, and only to a very small extent due to the growth in number of PubMed abstracts. DISEASES now also makes use of a new GWAS database, Target Illumination by GWAS Analytics, which considerably increased the number of GWAS-derived disease-gene associations.

Growing research has highlighted the critical importance of identifying and understanding the roles of chemicals in reproductive biology. However, the functions and mechanisms of chemicals in reproductive processes remain incomplete. We developed a comprehensive database called the Reproductive Chemical Database (RCDB) ( https://yu.life.sjtu.edu.cn/ChenLab/RCDB ) to facilitate research on chemicals in reproductive biology. This resource is founded on rigorous manual literature extraction and precise protein target prediction methodologies. This database focuses on the delineation of chemicals associated with phenotypes, diseases, or endpoints intricately associated with four important reproductive processes: female and male gamete generation, fertilization, and embryo development in human and mouse. The RCDB encompasses 93 sub-GO processes, and it revealed 1447 intricate chemical-biological process interactions. To date, the RCDB has meticulously cataloged and annotated 830 distinct chemicals, while also predicting 614 target proteins from a selection of 3800 potential candidates. Additionally, the RCDB offers an online predictive tool that empowers researchers to ascertain whether specific chemicals play discernible functional roles in these reproductive processes. The RCDB is an exhaustive, cross-platform, manually curated database, which provides a user-friendly interface to search, browse, and use reproductive processes modulators and their comprehensive related information.

35389344,Protist.guru: A Comparative Transcriptomics Database for Protists.,"During the last few decades, the study of microbial ecology has been enabled by molecular and genomic data. DNA sequencing has revealed the surprising extent of microbial diversity and how microbial processes run global ecosystems. However, significant gaps in our understanding of the microbial world remain, and one example is that microbial eukaryotes, or protists, are still largely neglected. To address this gap, we used gene expression data from 17 protist species to create protist.guru: an online database equipped with tools for identifying co-expressed genes, gene families, and co-expression clusters enriched for specific biological functions.

40996709,Gene Loss DB: a curated database for gene loss in mammals-the cetacean collection.,"Molecular databases are essential resources for both experimental and computational biologists. The rapid increase in high-quality genome assemblies has led to a surge in publications describing secondary gene loss events associated with lineage-specific adaptations across diverse vertebrate groups. This growing volume of information underscores the urgent need for organized, searchable, and curated resources that facilitate data discovery, allow detection of broad evolutionary patterns, and support downstream analyses. Currently, no existing database compiles manually curated and validated information on published secondary gene loss events. Here, we introduce the Gene Loss Database (Gene Loss DB), a platform designed to centralize and present these data in an easy-to-search and user-friendly format (https://geneloss.org/). Gene Loss DB compiles gene loss events alongside supporting evidence, including the inferred mechanism of gene loss (exon deletion, gene deletion, loss of function mutation), the type of data used to support inactivation (genomic, transcriptomic, single/multiple individual sequence reads, synteny maps) and, when available, whether the event is shared across all lineages within a taxon. Each entry also includes a short excerpt from the original publication to provide context. This information is structured in the database to be searchable by species, gene, taxa, or by gene ontology terms linked to the gene in question. The initial release of Gene Loss DB focuses on cetaceans, a lineage with numerous gene loss events linked to aquatic adaptations.

37181287,CRAC (Clinical Relevance of Alterations in Cancer): a Knowledge Base for the Selection of Molecularly Matched Therapy for Solid Tumors.,"Multigene testing using NGS (next-generation sequencing) provides a large amount of information and can detect multiple molecular alterations. Subsequent clinical interpretation is a time-consuming process necessary to select a treatment strategy. Existing databases often contain inconsistent information and are not regularly updated. The use of ESCAT levels of evidence requires a deep understanding of the nature of alterations and does not answer the question of which therapy option to select when multiple biomarkers with the same level of evidence are detected. To address these issues, we created the Clinical Relevance of Alterations in Cancer (CRAC) database on the relevance of detected alterations in specific genes, which are often analyzed as part of NGS panels. The team of oncologists and biologists assigned a CRAC score from 1 to 10 to each biomarker (a type of genomic alteration characteristic of specific genes) for 15 malignancies; an average score was entered into the database. CRAC scores are a numerical reflection of the following factors: therapy availability and the prospects of drug treatment with experimental drugs for patients with a particular type of tumor. A total of 134 genes and 15 of the most common tumor types have been selected for CRAC. The biomarker-nosology associations with CRAC scores in the range of 1-3 are the most frequent (n=2719 out of 3495; 77.8%), the least frequent ones (n=52 out of 3495; 1.5%) are with the highest CRAC scores 9 and 10. To estimate the practical effectiveness of the CRAC database, 208 reports on comprehensive molecular profiling were retrospectively analyzed; the applicability of CRAC was compared with the ESCAT level of evidence system. The highest CRAC scores corresponded to the ESCAT maximum levels of evidence: the range of scores 8-10 corresponded to evidence levels I and II. No biomarker within the same level of evidence was represented by the same CRAC score; the largest range of CRAC scores was observed for biomarkers of levels evidence IIIA and IV - from 2 to 10 and from 1 to 9, respectively. The use of CRAC scores allowed to identify additional 95 alterations with CRAC scores of 1-5 in the studied patients.

39910485,"sORFdb - a database for sORFs, small proteins, and small protein families in bacteria.","Small proteins with fewer than 100, particularly fewer than 50, amino acids are still largely unexplored. Nonetheless, they represent an essential part of bacteria's often neglected genetic repertoire. In recent years, the development of ribosome profiling protocols has led to the detection of an increasing number of previously unknown small proteins. Despite this, they are overlooked in many cases by automated genome annotation pipelines, and often, no functional descriptions can be assigned due to a lack of known homologs. To understand and overcome these limitations, the current abundance of small proteins in existing databases was evaluated, and a new dedicated database for small proteins and their potential functions, called 'sORFdb', was created. To this end, small proteins were extracted from annotated bacterial genomes in the GenBank database. Subsequently, they were quality-filtered, compared, and complemented with proteins from Swiss-Prot, UniProt, and SmProt to ensure reliable identification and characterization of small proteins. Families of similar small proteins were created using bidirectional best BLAST hits followed by Markov clustering. Analysis of small proteins in public databases revealed that their number is still limited due to historical and technical constraints. Additionally, functional descriptions were often missing despite the presence of potential homologs. As expected, a taxonomic bias was evident in over-represented clinically relevant bacteria. This new and comprehensive database is accessible via a feature-rich website providing specialized search features for sORFs and small proteins of high quality. Additionally, small protein families with Hidden Markov Models and information on taxonomic distribution and other physicochemical properties are available. In conclusion, the novel small protein database sORFdb is a specialized, taxonomy-independent database that improves the findability and classification of sORFs, small proteins, and their functions in bacteria, thereby supporting their future detection and consistent annotation.

38628370,KANPHOS: Kinase-associated neural phospho-signaling database for data-driven research.,"Protein phosphorylation, a key regulator of cellular processes, plays a central role in brain function and is implicated in neurological disorders. Information on protein phosphorylation is expected to be a clue for understanding various neuropsychiatric disorders and developing therapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, existing databases lack a specific focus on phosphorylation events in the brain, which are crucial for investigating the downstream pathway regulated by neurotransmitters. To overcome the gap, we have developed a web-based database named ""Kinase-Associated Neural PHOspho-Signaling (KANPHOS)."" This paper presents the design concept, detailed features, and a series of improvements for KANPHOS. KANPHOS is designed to support data-driven research by fulfilling three key objectives: (1) enabling the search for protein kinases and their substrates related to extracellular signals or diseases; (2) facilitating a consolidated search for information encompassing phosphorylated substrate genes, proteins, mutant mice, diseases, and more; and (3) offering integrated functionalities to support pathway and network analysis. KANPHOS is also equipped with API functionality to interact with external databases and analysis tools, enhancing its utility in data-driven investigations.

37183478,y-mtPTM: Yeast mitochondrial posttranslational modification database.,"One powerful strategy of how to increase the complexity of cellular proteomes is through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. Currently, there are ∼400 types of PTMs, the different combinations of which yield a large variety of protein isoforms with distinct biochemical properties. Although mitochondrial proteins undergoing PTMs were identified nearly 6 decades ago, studies on the roles and extent of PTMs on mitochondrial functions lagged behind the other cellular compartments. The application of mass spectrometry for the characterization of the mitochondrial proteome as well as for the detection of various PTMs resulted in the identification of thousands of amino acid positions that can be modified by different chemical groups. However, the data on mitochondrial PTMs are scattered in several data sets, and the available databases do not contain a complete list of modified residues. To integrate information on PTMs of the mitochondrial proteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we built the yeast mitochondrial posttranslational modification (y-mtPTM) database (http://compbio.fmph.uniba.sk/y-mtptm/). It lists nearly 20,000 positions on mitochondrial proteins affected by ∼20 various PTMs, with phosphorylated, succinylated, acetylated, and ubiquitylated sites being the most abundant. A simple search of a protein of interest reveals the modified amino acid residues, their position within the primary sequence as well as on its 3D structure, and links to the source reference(s).

"37716955, 37897355",A3DyDB: exploring structural aggregation propensities in the yeast proteome.,"<h4>Background</h4>The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is a well-established model system for studying protein aggregation due to the conservation of essential cellular structures and pathways found across eukaryotes. However, limited structural knowledge of its proteome has prevented a deeper understanding of yeast functionalities, interactions, and aggregation.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we introduce the A3D yeast database (A3DyDB), which offers an extensive catalog of aggregation propensity predictions for the S. cerevisiae proteome. We used Aggrescan 3D (A3D) and the newly released protein models from AlphaFold2 (AF2) to compute the structure-based aggregation predictions for 6039 yeast proteins. The A3D algorithm exploits the information from 3D protein structures to calculate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. To facilitate simple and intuitive data analysis, A3DyDB provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing information on aggregation predictions from yeast protein structures. The A3DyDB also allows for the evaluation of the influence of natural or engineered mutations on protein stability and solubility.

36698975,"CUCUME: An RNA methylation database integrating systemic mRNAs signals, GWAS and QTL genetic regulation and epigenetics in different tissues of <i>Cucurbitaceae</i>.","As an internal modification of transcripts, RNA methylation determines RNA fate by changing RNA-protein binding affinity. In plants, RNA methylation is ubiquitous and is involved in all aspects of RNA post-transcriptional regulation. For instance, long-distance mobile RNAs, strongly influenced by their methylation status, play important roles in plant growth, development and environmental adaptation. Cucumber/pumpkin heterografts are widely used to improve stress tolerance of cucumber and to study mobile RNA signals due to their strong developed vasculature system. Here, we developed the Cucume (Cucurbit RNA methylation, http://cucume.cn/) database for these two important vegetables, cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i> L.) and pumpkin (<i>Cucurbita moschata</i>) with high productivity worldwide. We identified mRNAs harboring 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) and N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) sites in pumpkin and cucumber at the whole genome level via Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) of different tissues and the vascular exudates. In addition to RNA methylation sites, the Cucume database includes graft-transmissible systemic mRNAs identified in previous studies using cucumber/pumpkin heterografts. The further integration of cucumber genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) allows the study of RNA methylation-related genetic and epigenetic regulation in cucurbits.

38662570,CORDAX web server: an online platform for the prediction and 3D visualization of aggregation motifs in protein sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteins, the molecular workhorses of biological systems, execute a multitude of critical functions dictated by their precise three-dimensional structures. In a complex and dynamic cellular environment, proteins can undergo misfolding, leading to the formation of aggregates that take up various forms, including amorphous and ordered aggregation in the shape of amyloid fibrils. This phenomenon is closely linked to a spectrum of widespread debilitating pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-II diabetes, and several other proteinopathies, but also hampers the engineering of soluble agents, as in the case of antibody development. As such, the accurate prediction of aggregation propensity within protein sequences has become pivotal due to profound implications in understanding disease mechanisms, as well as in improving biotechnological and therapeutic applications.<h4>Results</h4>We previously developed Cordax, a structure-based predictor that utilizes logistic regression to detect aggregation motifs in protein sequences based on their structural complementarity to the amyloid cross-beta architecture. Here, we present a dedicated web server interface for Cordax. This online platform combines several features including detailed scoring of sequence aggregation propensity, as well as 3D visualization with several customization options for topology models of the structural cores formed by predicted aggregation motifs.

In this study, in order to enhance our understanding of olfactory perception, Atomevo-Odor (http://cslodordatabase.7fx.cn/), a comprehensive database for odorants, ORs, and high-quality OR-odorant responses combining experimental data and artificial intelligence prediction, was constructed. Moreover, graph theory and unsupervised learning methods were employed to classify the odorants, and the relationship between odorant functional groups and fragrance types was examined, along with the recognition mechanism of ORs for different odorant functional groups. Furthermore, a CNN-based model was developed for the OR-odorant response prediction.

39407093,Be-dataHIVE: a base editing database.,"Base editing is an enhanced gene editing approach that enables the precise transformation of single nucleotides and has the potential to cure rare diseases. The design process of base editors is labour-intensive and outcomes are not easily predictable. For any clinical use, base editing has to be accurate and efficient. Thus, any bystander mutations have to be minimized. In recent years, computational models to predict base editing outcomes have been developed. However, the overall robustness and performance of those models is limited. One way to improve the performance is to train models on a diverse, feature-rich, and large dataset, which does not exist for the base editing field. Hence, we develop BE-dataHIVE, a mySQL database that covers over 460,000 gRNA target combinations. The current version of BE-dataHIVE consists of data from five studies and is enriched with melting temperatures and energy terms.

37143876,LDRGDb - Legumes disease resistance genes database.,"Legumes comprise one of the world's largest, most diverse, and economically important plant families, known for their nutritional and medicinal benefits. Legumes are susceptible to a wide range of diseases, similar to other agricultural crops. Diseases have a considerable impact on the production of legume crop species, resulting in large yield losses worldwide. Due to continuous interactions between plants and their pathogens in the environment and the evolution of new pathogens under high selection pressure; disease resistant genes emerge in plant cultivars in the field against those pathogens or disease. Thus, disease resistant genes play critical roles in plant resistance responses, and their discovery and subsequent use in breeding programmes aid in reducing yield loss. The genomic era, with its high-throughput and low-cost genomic tools, has revolutionised our understanding of the complex interactions between legumes and pathogens, resulting in the identification of several critical participants in both the resistant and susceptible relationships. However, a substantial amount of existing information about numerous legume species has been disseminated as text or is preserved across fractions in different databases, posing a challenge for researchers. As a result, the range, scope, and complexity of these resources pose challenges to those who manage and use them. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop tools and a single conjugate database to manage genetic information for the world's plant genetic resources, allowing for the rapid incorporation of essential resistance genes into breeding strategies. Here, developed the first comprehensive database of disease resistance genes named as LDRGDb - LEGUMES DISEASE RESISTANCE GENES DATABASE comprises 10 legumes [Pigeon pea (<i>Cajanus cajan</i>), Chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), Lentil (<i>Lens culinaris</i>), Alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>), Barrelclover (<i>Medicago truncatula</i>), Common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), Pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>),Faba bean (<i>Vicia faba</i>), and Cowpea (<i>Vigna unguiculata</i>)].

36300618,The protein common assembly database (ProtCAD)-a comprehensive structural resource of protein complexes.,"Proteins often act through oligomeric interactions with other proteins. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy provide detailed information on the structures of biological assemblies, defined as the most likely biologically relevant structures derived from experimental data. In crystal structures, the most relevant assembly may be ambiguously determined, since multiple assemblies observed in the crystal lattice may be plausible. It is estimated that 10-15% of PDB entries may have incorrect or ambiguous assembly annotations. Accurate assemblies are required for understanding functional data and training of deep learning methods for predicting assembly structures. As with any other kind of biological data, replication via multiple independent experiments provides important validation for the determination of biological assembly structures. Here we present the Protein Common Assembly Database (ProtCAD), which presents clusters of protein assembly structures observed in independent structure determinations of homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). ProtCAD is searchable by PDB entry, UniProt identifiers, or Pfam domain designations and provides downloads of coordinate files, PyMol scripts, and publicly available assembly annotations for each cluster of assemblies.

Recently, advances in a plethora of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based methods have accelerated the enormous genomic data generation associated with stress-induced transcripts such as microarray, RNAseq, Expressed Sequenced Tag (ESTs), etc. Many databases related to microarray and RNA-seq based transcripts have been developed and profusely utilized. However, an abundant amount of transcripts related to abiotic stresses in various cereal crops arising from EST technology are available but still remain underutilized in absence of a consolidated database. In this study, an attempt has been made with a primary goal to integrate, analyse, and characterise the available resources of ESTs responsive to abiotic stresses in major cereals. The developed CerealESTdb presents a customisable search in two different ways in the form of searchable content for easy access and potential use. This database comprises ESTs from four major cereal crops, namely rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.), wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.), sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolour</i> L.), and maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.), under a set of abiotic stresses. The current statistics of this cohesive database consists of 55,826 assembled EST sequences, 51,791 predicted genes models, and their 254,609 gene ontology terms including extensive information on 1,746 associated metabolic pathways. We anticipate that developed CerealESTdb will be helpful in deciphering the knowledge of complex biological phenomena under abiotic stresses to accelerate the molecular breeding programs towards the development of crop cultivars resilient to abiotic stresses.

40181386,Clc-db: an open-source online database of chiral ligands and catalysts.,"The design and optimization of chiral ligands and catalysts are fundamental to advancing asymmetric catalysis, a critical area in organic chemistry with wide-ranging impacts across scientific disciplines. Traditional experimental approaches, while essential, are often hindered by their slow pace and complexity. Recent advancements have demonstrated that computational methods, particularly machine learning, offer transformative potential by significantly accelerating these processes through enhanced prediction and modeling capabilities. However, limitations such as data scarcity and model inaccuracies continue to challenge their broader application. To address these issues, we present the Chiral Ligand and Catalyst Database (CLC-DB), the first open-source, comprehensive database specifically designed for chiral ligands and catalysts. CLC-DB contains 1,861 molecules spanning 32 distinctive chiral ligand and catalyst categories, with each entry annotated with 34 types of curated information, validated by chemical experts and linked to authoritative chemical databases.

34643709,Kincore: a web resource for structural classification of protein kinases and their inhibitors.,"The active form of kinases is shared across different family members, as are several commonly observed inactive forms. We previously performed a clustering of the conformation of the activation loop of all protein kinase structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) into eight classes based on the dihedral angles that place the Phe side chain of the DFG motif at the N-terminus of the activation loop. Our clusters are strongly associated with the placement of the activation loop, the C-helix, and other structural elements of kinases. We present Kincore, a web resource providing access to our conformational assignments for kinase structures in the PDB. While other available databases provide conformational states or drug type but not both, KinCore includes the conformational state and the inhibitor type (Type 1, 1.5, 2, 3, allosteric) for each kinase chain. The user can query and browse the database using these attributes or determine the conformational labels of a kinase structure using the web server or a standalone program. The database and labeled structure files can be downloaded from the server.

A prodrug is a chemical compound, which gets metabolized into a pharmacologically active form (drug) inside the body after its administration. In the current work, we report 'smProdrugs' (http://cheminfolab.in/databases/prodrug/), which is one of the first exclusive databases on small molecule prodrugs. It stores the structures, physicochemical properties and experimental ADMET data manually curated from literature. SmProdrugs lists 626 small molecule prodrugs and their active compounds with the above mentioned experimental data from 1808 research articles and 61 patents have been stored. The information page of each record gives the structures and properties of the prodrug and the active drug side by side which makes it easy for the user to instantly compare them. The structural modifications in the prodrug/active drugs are highlighted in a different colour for easy comparison. Experimental data has been curated from the downloaded PubMed and patent articles and were catalogued in a tabular form with more than 25 fields under sub-sections i) name and structures of the prodrugs and their active compounds, ii) mode of activation of the prodrug and enzyme/biocatalyst involved in the conversion, iii) indications/disease, iv) pharmacological target, v) experimental pharmacokinetic properties such as solubility, absorption, volume of distribution, half-life, clearance etc. and vi) information on the purpose/gain from the prodrug strategies.

38428997,AraLeTA: An Arabidopsis leaf expression atlas across diurnal and developmental scales.,"Mature plant leaves are a composite of distinct cell types, including epidermal, mesophyll, and vascular cells. Notably, the proportion of these cells and the relative transcript concentrations within different cell types may change over time. While gene expression data at a single-cell level can provide cell-type-specific expression values, it is often too expensive to obtain these data for high-resolution time series. Although bulk RNA-seq can be performed in a high-resolution time series, RNA-seq using whole leaves measures average gene expression values across all cell types in each sample. In this study, we combined single-cell RNA-seq data with time-series data from whole leaves to assemble an atlas of cell-type-specific changes in gene expression over time for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We inferred how the relative transcript concentrations of different cell types vary across diurnal and developmental timescales. Importantly, this analysis revealed 3 subgroups of mesophyll cells with distinct temporal profiles of expression. Finally, we developed tissue-specific gene networks that form a community resource: an Arabidopsis Leaf Time-dependent Atlas (AraLeTa). This allows users to extract gene networks that are confirmed by transcription factor-binding data and specific to certain cell types at certain times of day and at certain developmental stages.

In this context, reliable datasets are of utmost importance. We herein present CidalsDB a novel web server for AI-assisted DD against infectious pathogens, namely Leishmania parasites and Coronaviruses. We performed a literature search on molecules with validated anti-pathogen effects. Then, we consolidated these data with bioassays from PubChem. Finally, we constructed a database to store these datasets and make them accessible and ready-to-use for the scientific community through CidalsDB, a web-based interface. In a second step, we implemented and optimized four machine learning (ML) and three deep learning (DL) algorithms that optimally predicted the biological activity of molecules. Random Forests (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and ChemBERTa were the best classifiers of anti-Leishmania molecules, while Gradient Boosting (GB), Graph-Convolutional Network (GCN) and ChemBERTa achieved the best performances on the Coronaviruses dataset. All six models were optimized and deployed through CidalsDB as anti-pathogen activity prediction models.Scientific contributionCidalsDB is an open access web-based tool that allows browsing and access to ready-to-use datasets of anti-pathogen molecules, alongside best performing AI models for biological activity prediction.

38530613,DOTAD: A Database of Therapeutic Antibody Developability.,"The development of therapeutic antibodies is an important aspect of new drug discovery pipelines. The assessment of an antibody's developability-its suitability for large-scale production and therapeutic use-is a particularly important step in this process. Given that experimental assays to assess antibody developability in large scale are expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have been a more efficient alternative. However, the antibody research community faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of readily accessible data on antibody developability, which is essential for training and validating computational models. To address this gap, DOTAD (Database Of Therapeutic Antibody Developability) has been built as the first database dedicated exclusively to the curation of therapeutic antibody developability information. DOTAD aggregates all available therapeutic antibody sequence data along with various developability metrics from the scientific literature, offering researchers a robust platform for data storage, retrieval, exploration, and downloading. In addition to serving as a comprehensive repository, DOTAD enhances its utility by integrating a web-based interface that features state-of-the-art tools for the assessment of antibody developability. This ensures that users not only have access to critical data but also have the convenience of analyzing and interpreting this information.

35401578,MiRAGDB: A Knowledgebase of RAG Regulators.,"RAG1 and RAG2 genes generate diversity in immunoglobulin and TCR genes by initiating the process of V-D-J recombination. RAGs recognize specific sequences (heptamer-nonamer) to generate a diversity of immunoglobulins. RAG expression is limited to early B and T cell developmental stages. Aberrant expression of RAG can lead to double strand breaks and translocations as observed in leukemia and lymphoma. The expression of RAG is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This study aimed to identify and catalog RAG regulation by miRNA during normal development and cancer. NGS data from normal B-cell and T-cell developmental stages and blood cancer samples have been analyzed for the expression of miRNAs against RAG1 (1,173 against human RAG1 and 749 against mouse RAG1). The analyzed data has been organized to retrieve the miRNA and mRNA expression of various RAG regulators (10 transcription factors and interacting partners) in normal and diseased states.

37351774,Canis MitoSNP database: a functional tool useful for comparative analyses of human and canine mitochondrial genomes.,"Canis MitoSNP is a tool allowing assignment of each mitochondrial genomic position a corresponding position in the mitochondrial gene and in the structure of tRNA, rRNA, and protein. The main aim of this bioinformatic tool was to use data from other bioinformatic tools (TMHMM, SOPMA, tRNA-SCAN, RNAfold, ConSurf) for dog and human mitochondrial genes in order to shorten the time necessary for the analysis of the whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as well as amino acid and protein analyses. Each position in the canine mitochondrial genome is assigned a position in genes, in codons, an amino acid position in proteins, or a position in tRNA or rRNA molecules. Therefore, a user analysing changes in the canine and human mitochondrial genome does not need to extract the sequences of individual genes from the mitochondrial genome for analysis and there is no need to rewrite them into amino acid sequences to assess whether the change is synonymous or nonsynonymous. Canis mitoSNP allows the comparison between the human and canine mitochondrial genomes as well. The Clustal W alignment of the dog and human mitochondrial DNA reference sequences for each gene obtained from GenBank (NC_002008.4 dog, NC_012920.1 human) was performed in order to determine which position in the canine mitochondrial genome corresponds to the position in the human mitochondrial genome.

36828269,ProSeqAProDB: Prosequence Assisted Protein Database.,"In early 1990s, several proteins were shown to depend on additional stretches of polypeptide (termed as prosequence/prodomain) for their folding. These regions of the protein were often termed as IMCs (Intra Molecular Chaperones), since they would be cleaved from the mature folded protein eventually. Such proteins were hypothesized to face a kinetic barrier to their folding, which was probably lowered by the prosequences. In last three decades, numerous examples of such proteins have accumulated in literature. Yet, no study has been reported so far attempting to understand the evolutionary differences and similaritess of such proteins. Till date such proteins are continued to be treated as anomalous variants, rather than as representatives of any alternate protein folding strategy. Do such proteins have any distinctive structural facets OR typical biological roles, necessitating an unconventional strategy of protein folding? Do prosequences carry any unique or conserved features that are essential to their function? ProSeqAProDb: ProSequence Assisted Protein Database, (which can be accessed at https://proseqaprodb.mkulab.in) was built as a comprehensive database, to systematically study such proteins along with their pro-sequences.

EccDNA is emerging as a rising star because of its ubiquitous existence in cancers and its crucial role in oncogene amplification and tumor progression. In the present study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of cancer samples were downloaded from public repositories. Afterwards, eccDNAs were identified from WGS data via bioinformatic analyses. To leverage database coverage, eccDNAs were also collected by manual curation of literatures. Gene expression and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and CCLE and then used to investigate the roles of eccDNAs in cancers. Finally, the first integrated database of eccDNAs, eccDNAdb, was developed. eccDNAdb currently includes 1270 eccDNAs, which were identified in 480 samples (of 42 cancers) after analyzing a total number of 3395 tumor samples (of 57 cancers) including patient tissues, patient-derived xenografts, and cancer cell lines.

38048333,HybridDBRpred: improved sequence-based prediction of DNA-binding amino acids using annotations from structured complexes and disordered proteins.,"Current predictors of DNA-binding residues (DBRs) from protein sequences belong to two distinct groups, those trained on binding annotations extracted from structured protein-DNA complexes (structure-trained) vs. intrinsically disordered proteins (disorder-trained). We complete the first empirical analysis of predictive performance across the structure- and disorder-annotated proteins for a representative collection of ten predictors. Majority of the structure-trained tools perform well on the structure-annotated proteins while doing relatively poorly on the disorder-annotated proteins, and vice versa. Several methods make accurate predictions for the structure-annotated proteins or the disorder-annotated proteins, but none performs highly accurately for both annotation types. Moreover, most predictors make excessive cross-predictions for the disorder-annotated proteins, where residues that interact with non-DNA ligand types are predicted as DBRs. Motivated by these results, we design, validate and deploy an innovative meta-model, hybridDBRpred, that uses deep transformer network to combine predictions generated by three best current predictors. HybridDBRpred provides accurate predictions and low levels of cross-predictions across the two annotation types, and is statistically more accurate than each of the ten tools and baseline meta-predictors that rely on averaging and logistic regression.

For such annotations, these softwares calculate the <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values of the peptide/protein precursor and fragment ions, for which a database of protein sequences must be provided as an input file. The calculated <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values are stored as another database, which the user usually cannot view. Database Creator for Mass Analysis of Peptides and Proteins (DC-MAPP) is a novel standalone software that can create custom databases for ""viewing"" the calculated <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values of precursor and fragment ions, prior to the database search. It contains three modules. Peptide/Protein sequences as per user's choice can be entered as input to the first module for creating a custom database. In the second module, <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values must be queried-in, which are searched within the custom database to identify protein/peptide sequences. The third module is suited for peptide mass fingerprinting, which can be used to analyze both ESI and MALDI mass spectral data. The feature of ""viewing"" the custom database can be helpful not only for better understanding the search engine processes, but also for designing multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods. Post-translational modifications and protein isoforms can also be analyzed. Since, DC-MAPP relies on the protein/peptide ""sequences"" for creating custom databases, it may not be applicable for the searches involving spectral libraries.

39657145,Probe my Pathway (PmP): a portal to explore the chemical coverage of the human Reactome.,"Deciphering pathway-phenotype associations is critical for a system-wide understanding of cells and the chemistry of life. An approach to reach this goal is to systematically modulate pathways pharmacologically. The targeted and controlled regulation of an increasing number of proteins is becoming possible, thanks to the growing list of chemical probes and chemogenomic compounds available to cell biologists, but no resource is available that directly maps these chemical tools on cellular pathways. To fill this gap, we developed Probe my Pathway (PmP), a database where high-quality chemical probes and well-characterized sets of chemogenomic compounds are mapped on all the human pathways of the Reactome database. The web interface allows users to browse the data via icicle charts or search the data for compounds, proteins, or pathways. Chemists can rapidly find pathways with low chemical coverage or explore the structural chemistry of ligands targeting specific cellular machineries. Cell biologists can look for chemical probes targeting different proteins in the same pathway or find which pathways are targeted by chemical probes of interest.

37750380,PDB-BRE: A ligand-protein interaction binding residue extractor based on Protein Data Bank.,"Proteins typically exert their biological functions by interacting with other biomolecules or ligands. The study of ligand-protein interactions is crucial in elucidating the biological mechanisms of proteins. Most existing studies have focused on analyzing ligand-protein interactions, and they ignore the additional situational of inserted and modified residues. Besides, the resources often support only a single ligand type and cannot obtain satisfied results in analyzing novel complexes. Therefore, it is important to develop a general analytical tool to extract the binding residues of ligand-protein interactions in complexes fully. In this study, we propose a ligand-protein interaction binding residue extractor (PDB-BRE), which can be used to automatically extract interacting ligand or protein-binding residues from complex three-dimensional (3D) structures based on the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB). PDB-BRE offers a notable advantage in its comprehensive support for analyzing six distinct types of ligands, including proteins, peptides, DNA, RNA, mixed DNA and RNA entities, and non-polymeric entities. Moreover, it takes into account the consideration of inserted and modified residues within complexes.

Research on IBD has generated massive amounts of data, including literature, metagenomics, metabolomics, bioresources and databases. We aim to create an IBD Integrated Resources Portal (IBDIRP) that provides the most comprehensive resources for IBD. An integrated platform was developed that provides information on different aspects of IBD research resources, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes, transcriptome, microbiota, metabolomics, single cells and other resources. Valuable and comprehensive IBD-related data were collected from PubMed, Google, GMrepo, gutMega, gutMDisorder, Single Cell Portal and other sources. Then, the data were systematically sorted, and these resources were manually curated. We systematically sorted and cataloged more than 320 unique risk SNPs associated with IBD in the SNP section. We presented over 289 IBD-related genes based on the database collection in the gene section. We also obtained 153 manually curated IBD transcriptomics data, including 12 388 samples, on the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The sorted IBD-related microbiota data from three primary microbiome databases (GMrepo, gutMega and gutMDisorder) were available for download. We selected 23 149 IBD-related taxonomic records from these databases. Additionally, we collected 24 IBD metabolomics studies with 2896 participants in the metabolomics section. We introduced two interactive single-cell data plug-in units that provided data visualization based on cells and genes.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as effective mediators for the communication both within and between species. They can carry and transport molecular cargoes to transmit biological messages. Several databases (ExoBCD, ExoCarta, EVpedia, EV-TRACK, Vesiclepedia) complied the cargoes information including DNA, RNA, protein, lipid and metabolite associated with EVs. Databases that refer to the complete records on both donor and recipient information are warranted to facilitate the understanding of the interaction across cells and species. In this study, we developed a database that compiled the records equipped with a structured process of EV-mediated interaction. The sources of donor and recipient were classified by cell type, tissues/organs and species, thus providing an extended knowledge of cell-cell, species-species interaction. The isolation and identification methods were presented for assessing the quality of EVs. Information on functional cargoes was included, where microRNA was linked to a prediction server to broaden its potential effects. Physiological and pathological context was marked to show the environment where EVs functioned.

Numerous methods have been developed for handling class imbalance, but they are not readily accessible to users with limited computational experience. Moreover, there is no resource that enables users to easily evaluate the effect of different over-sampling algorithms.<h4>Results</h4>METAbolomics data Balancing with Over-sampling Algorithms (META-BOA) is a web-based application that enables users to select between four different methods for class balancing, followed by data visualization and classification of the sample to observe the augmentation effects. META-BOA outputs a newly balanced dataset, generating additional samples in the minority class, according to the user's choice of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Borderline-SMOTE (BSMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) or Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE). To present the effect of over-sampling on the data META-BOA further displays both principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding visualization of data pre- and post-over-sampling. Random forest classification is utilized to compare sample classification in both the original and balanced datasets, enabling users to select the most appropriate method for their further analyses.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>META-BOA is available at https://complimet.ca/meta-boa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,,meta-boa,16.99757975,ok,,metabolomics | balancing with over-sampling algorithms,meta | boa | eta-boa,v2,0.99757975,METAbolomics data Balancing with Over-sampling Algorithms,True,3.0,False,False,https://complimet.ca/meta-boa,https://complimet.ca/meta-boa,True,...y and implementation</h4>META-BOA is available at https://complimet.ca/meta-boa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
36988160,ProsmORF-pred: a machine learning-based method for the identification of small ORFs in prokaryotic genomes.,"Small open reading frames (smORFs) encoding proteins less than 100 amino acids (aa) are known to be important regulators of key cellular processes. However, their computational identification remains a challenge. Based on a comprehensive analysis of known prokaryotic small ORFs, we have developed the ProsmORF-pred resource which uses a machine learning (ML)-based method for prediction of smORFs in the prokaryotic genome sequences. ProsmORF-pred consists of two ML models, one for initiation site recognition in nucleic acid sequences upstream of putative start codons and the other uses translated amino acid sequences to decipher functional protein like sequences. The nucleotide sequence-based initiation site recognition model has been trained using longer ORFs (>100 aa) in the same genome while the ML model for identification of protein like sequences has been trained using annotated smORFs from Escherichia coli. Comprehensive benchmarking of ProsmORF-pred reveals that its performance is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches on the annotated smORF set derived from 32 prokaryotic genomes. Its performance is distinctly superior to other tools like PRODIGAL and RANSEPS for prediction of newly identified smORFs which have a length range of 10-30 aa, where prediction of smORFs has been a major challenge. Apart from identification of smORFs in genomic sequences, ProsmORF-pred can also aid in functional annotation of the predicted smORFs based on sequence similarity and genomic neighbourhood similarity searches in ProsmORFDB, a well-curated database of known smORFs.

37337236,The Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database (CAMHRED): tools and methods for local evidence mapping.,"<h4>Background</h4>Local evidence is important for contextualized knowledge translation. It can be used to adapt global recommendations, to identify future research priorities and inform local policy decisions. However, there are challenges in identifying local evidence in a systematic, comprehensive, and timely manner. There is limited guidance on how to map local evidence and provide it to users in an accessible and user-friendly way. In this study, we address these issues by describing the methods for the development of a centralized database of health research evidence for Cameroon and its applications for research prioritization and decision making.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched 10 electronic health databases and hand-searched the archives of non-indexed African and Cameroonian journals. We screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of peer reviewed journal articles published between 1999 and 2019 in English or French that assess health related outcomes in Cameroonian populations. We extracted relevant study characteristics based on a pre-established guide. We developed a coding scheme or taxonomy of content areas so that local evidence is mapped to corresponding domains and subdomains. Pairs of reviewers coded articles independently and resolved discrepancies by consensus. Moreover, we developed guidance on how to search the database, use search results to create evidence maps and conduct knowledge gap analyses.<h4>Results</h4>The Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database (CAMHRED) is a bilingual centralized online portal of local evidence on health in Cameroon from 1999 onwards. It currently includes 4384 studies categorized into content domains and study characteristics (design, setting, year and language of publication). The database is searchable by keywords or through a guided search. Results including abstracts, relevant study characteristics and bibliographic information are available for users to download. Upon request, guidance on how to optimize search results for applications like evidence maps and knowledge gap analyses is also available.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CAMHRED ( https://camhred.org/ ) is a systematic, comprehensive, and centralized resource for local evidence about health in Cameroon.

37953323,ncRNADrug: a database for validated and predicted ncRNAs associated with drug resistance and targeted by drugs.,"Drug resistance is a major barrier in cancer treatment and anticancer drug development. Growing evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play pivotal roles in cancer progression, therapy, and drug resistance. Furthermore, ncRNAs have been proven to be promising novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Reversing dysregulated ncRNAs by drugs holds significant potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for overcoming drug resistance. Therefore, we developed ncRNADrug, an integrated and comprehensive resource that records manually curated and computationally predicted ncRNAs associated with drug resistance, ncRNAs targeted by drugs, as well as potential drug combinations for the treatment of resistant cancer. Currently, ncRNADrug collects 29 551 experimentally validated entries involving 9195 ncRNAs (2248 miRNAs, 4145 lncRNAs and 2802 circRNAs) associated with the drug resistance of 266 drugs, and 32 969 entries involving 10 480 ncRNAs (4338 miRNAs, 6087 lncRNAs and 55 circRNAs) targeted by 965 drugs. In addition, ncRNADrug also contains associations between ncRNAs and drugs predicted from ncRNA expression profiles by differential expression analysis.

37154702,GTExVisualizer: a web platform for supporting ageing studies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Studying ageing effects on molecules is an important new topic for life science. To perform such studies, the need for data, models, algorithms, and tools arises to elucidate molecular mechanisms. GTEx (standing for Genotype-Tissue Expression) portal is a web-based data source allowing to retrieve patients' transcriptomics data annotated with tissues, gender, and age information. It represents the more complete data sources for ageing effects studies. Nevertheless, it lacks functionalities to query data at the sex/age level, as well as tools for protein interaction studies, thereby limiting ageing studies. As a result, users need to download query results to proceed to further analysis, such as retrieving the expression of a given gene on different age (or sex) classes in many tissues.<h4>Results</h4>We present the GTExVisualizer, a platform to query and analyse GTEx data. This tool contains a web interface able to: (i) graphically represent and study query results; (ii) analyse genes using sex/age expression patterns, also integrated with network-based modules; and (iii) report results as plot-based representation as well as (gene) networks.

38865432,IPAD-DB: a manually curated database for experimentally verified inhibitors of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a universal neurodegenerative disease with the feature of progressive dementia. Currently, there are only seven Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of AD, which merely offer temporary relief from symptom deterioration without reversing the underlying disease process. The identification of inhibitors capable of interacting with proteins associated with AD plays a pivotal role in the development of effective therapeutic interventions. However, a vast number of such inhibitors are dispersed throughout numerous published articles, rendering it inconvenient for researchers to explore potential drug candidates for AD. In light of this, we have manually compiled inhibitors targeting proteins associated with AD and constructed a comprehensive database known as IPAD-DB (Inhibitors of Proteins associated with Alzheimer's Disease Database). The curated inhibitors within this database encompass a diverse range of compounds, including natural compounds, synthetic compounds, drugs, natural extracts and nano-inhibitors. To date, the database has compiled >4800 entries, each representing a correspondent relationship between an inhibitor and its target protein. IPAD-DB offers a user-friendly interface that facilitates browsing, searching and downloading of its records.

In order to face this challenge, we have previously developed INSaFLU, a free web-based bioinformatics platform for virus next-generation sequencing data analysis. Here, we considerably expanded its genomic surveillance component and developed a new module (TELEVIR) for metagenomic virus identification.<h4>Results</h4>The routine genomic surveillance component was strengthened with new workflows and functionalities, including (i) a reference-based genome assembly pipeline for Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) data; (ii) automated SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification; (iii) Nextclade analysis; (iv) Nextstrain phylogeographic and temporal analysis (SARS-CoV-2, human and avian influenza, monkeypox, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A/B), as well as a ""generic"" build for other viruses); and (v) algn2pheno for screening mutations of interest. Both INSaFLU pipelines for reference-based consensus generation (Illumina and ONT) were benchmarked against commonly used command line bioinformatics workflows for SARS-CoV-2, and an INSaFLU snakemake version was released. In parallel, a new module (TELEVIR) for virus detection was developed, after extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art metagenomics software and following up-to-date recommendations and practices in the field. TELEVIR allows running complex workflows, covering several combinations of steps (e.g., with/without viral enrichment or host depletion), classification software (e.g., Kaiju, Kraken2, Centrifuge, FastViromeExplorer), and databases (RefSeq viral genome, Virosaurus, etc.), while culminating in user- and diagnosis-oriented reports.

35289353,HLA3D: an integrated structure-based computational toolkit for immunotherapy.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), also known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA), plays an important role in the adaptive immune system by presenting non-self-peptides to T cell receptors. The MHC region has been shown to be associated with a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation and tumours. However, structural analytic tools of HLA are still sparse compared to the number of identified HLA alleles, which hinders the disclosure of its pathogenic mechanism.<h4>Result</h4>To provide an integrative analysis of HLA, we first collected 1296 amino acid sequences, 256 protein data bank structures, 120 000 frequency data of HLA alleles in different populations, 73 000 publications and 39 000 disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism sites, as well as 212 modelled HLA heterodimer structures. Then, we put forward two new strategies for building up a toolkit for transplantation and tumour immunotherapy, designing risk alignment pipeline and antigenic peptide prediction pipeline by integrating different resources and bioinformatic tools. By integrating 100 000 calculated HLA conformation difference and online tools, risk alignment pipeline provides users with the functions of structural alignment, sequence alignment, residue visualization and risk report generation of mismatched HLA molecules. For tumour antigen prediction, we first predicted 370 000 immunogenic peptides based on the affinity between peptides and MHC to generate the neoantigen catalogue for 11 common tumours. We then designed an antigenic peptide prediction pipeline to provide the functions of mutation prediction, peptide prediction, immunogenicity assessment and docking simulation. We also present a case study of hepatitis B virus mutations associated with liver cancer that demonstrates the high legitimacy of our antigenic peptide prediction process.

37823705,FL-circAS: an integrative resource and analysis for full-length sequences and alternative splicing of circular RNAs with nanopore sequencing.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are RNA molecules with a continuous loop structure characterized by back-splice junctions (BSJs). While analyses of short-read RNA sequencing have identified millions of BSJ events, it is inherently challenging to determine exact full-length sequences and alternatively spliced (AS) isoforms of circRNAs. Recent advances in nanopore long-read sequencing with circRNA enrichment bring an unprecedented opportunity for investigating the issues. Here, we developed FL-circAS (https://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/FL-circAS/), which collected such long-read sequencing data of 20 cell lines/tissues and thereby identified 884 636 BSJs with 1 853 692 full-length circRNA isoforms in human and 115 173 BSJs with 135 617 full-length circRNA isoforms in mouse. FL-circAS also provides multiple circRNA features. For circRNA expression, FL-circAS calculates expression levels for each circRNA isoform, cell line/tissue specificity at both the BSJ and isoform levels, and AS entropy for each BSJ across samples. For circRNA biogenesis, FL-circAS identifies reverse complementary sequences and RNA binding protein (RBP) binding sites residing in flanking sequences of BSJs. For functional patterns, FL-circAS identifies potential microRNA/RBP binding sites and several types of evidence for circRNA translation on each full-length circRNA isoform.

40151429,Data resource profile: Scottish Linked Pregnancy and Baby Dataset (SLiPBD).,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Here we present the Scottish Linked Pregnancy and Baby Dataset (SLiPBD), a new national data resource held by Public Health Scotland (PHS).<h4>Methods</h4>SLiPBD comprises a population-based e-cohort of all fetuses and births (babies) from pregnancies to women in Scotland from 2000 onwards. It is updated monthly by linking and reconciling the following national datasets: antenatal booking records; general and maternity hospital discharge records; termination of pregnancy notifications; and statutory live and stillbirth registrations.<h4>Results</h4>Key information included on all babies in SLiPBD includes estimated date of conception, end of pregnancy date, gestation, multiple pregnancy status, pregnancy outcome, and maternal sociodemographic characteristics. For live births, additional information on the birth, the baby's sociodemographic characteristics, and subsequent infant deaths is included.Following the cohort refresh in January 2024, SLiPBD contained 1,770,226 babies from 1,750,830 pregnancies to 898,161 women. Of the 1,770,226 babies, 1,284,461 (73%) were live births, 5,731 (0.3%) stillbirths, and 316,897 (18%) and 114,840 (6%) came from a pregnancy ending a termination or early spontaneous loss respectively. 22,414 (1%) had an unknown pregnancy outcome, and for 25,883 (1%) the pregnancy was still ongoing. Data completeness for key sociodemographic characteristics except for ethnicity was very high, and variables showed expected patterns. Ethnicity data completeness is poor on historical records but improving over time. Completeness of unique patient identifiers was very high. External validation to source datasets was reassuring.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SLiPBD can be analysed standalone or linked to other national vital event and health datasets held by PHS. It supports longitudinal and intergenerational analyses, enabling epidemiological and health service surveillance and research on maternal and child health. Researchers interested in accessing pseudonymised extracts of SLiPBD through the Scottish NHS safe haven facility should contact Research Data Scotland.

37947313,AFRbase: a database of protein mutations responsible for antifungal resistance.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Fungal pathogens are known to cause life threatening invasive infections with rising global mortality rates. Besides, the indiscriminate use of antifungals in both clinics and agriculture has promoted antifungal drug resistance in the last decade. Fungi can show drug resistance by a variety of mechanisms. But primary driver in all these hitherto documented mechanisms is stable and heritable point mutations in the key proteins. Therefore, cataloguing mutations that can confer resistance is the first step toward understanding the mechanisms leading to the emergence of antifungal resistance.<h4>Results</h4>In the present, work we have described a database of all the mutations responsible for antifungal resistance. Named as antifungal resistance database (AFRbase), it is better than the existing databases of antifungal resistance namely, FunResDB and MARDy which have a limited scope and inadequate information. Data of AFRbase was collected using both text mining and manual curation. AFRbase provides a separate window for visualization of mutations in the 2D and 3D formats making it easy for researchers to analyze the mutation data and ensures interoperability with other standard molecular biology databases like NCBI and UniProtKB. We hope AFRbase can be useful to both clinicians and basic biomedical scientists as we envision it as an important resource for genotypic susceptibility testing of fungi and to study/predict the course of evolution of antifungal resistance. The current version of AFRbase contains manually curated 3691 unique mutations present in 29 proteins of 32 fungal species along with the information of drugs against which resistance is caused.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AFRbase is an open access database available at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/.",True,False,5.0,,,frbase,16.9949348,ok,,afrbase | antifungal resistance database | funresdb | uniprotkb,mardy,v2,0.9949348,AFRbase,True,5.0,False,False,http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/,http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/,True,...4>AFRbase is an open access database available at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/.,1

39660955,SG-ML-PLAP: A structure-guided machine learning-based scoring function for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.,"Computational methods to predict binding affinity of protein-ligand complex have been used extensively to design inhibitors for proteins selected as drug targets. In recent years machine learning (ML) is being increasingly used for design of drugs/inhibitors. However, ranking compounds as per their experimental binding affinity has remained a major challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to develop ML-based scoring function (MLSF) for predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. In this work, protein-ligand interaction features, namely, extended connectivity interaction fingerprints (ECIF), derived from the PDBbind dataset have been used to build ML models for binding affinity prediction. The benchmarking has been done on the Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions (CASF) dataset and also by predicting the binding affinity of unseen protein-ligand complexes which have structural features different from those present in the training dataset. Furthermore, an improvement in the performance of MLSF on the redocked CASF complexes generated by AutoDock Vina software was seen when the training set consisting of crystal structures was supplemented with redocked protein-ligand complexes. The MLSF trained on crystal structures alone using a combination of ECIF and VINA features also predicted binding affinities of crystal as well as docked complexes with high accuracy. Overall, the MLSF developed in this work shows improved performance compared to conventional SFs and several other MLSFs. It will be a valuable resource for identifying novel inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening protocols.

40996706,p53motifDB: integration of genomic information and tumour suppressor p53 binding motifs.,"The tumour suppressor gene TP53 encodes the DNA binding transcription factor p53 and is one of the most mutated genes in human cancer. Tumour suppressor activity requires binding of p53 to its DNA response elements and subsequent transcriptional activation of a diverse set of target genes. Despite decades of close study, the logic underlying p53 interactions with its numerous potential genomic binding sites and target genes is not yet fully understood. Here, we present a database of DNA and chromatin-based information focused on putative p53 binding sites in the human genome to allow users to generate and test new hypotheses related to p53 activity in the genome. Users can query genomic locations based on experimentally observed p53 binding, regulatory element activity, genetic variation, evolutionary conservation, chromatin modification state, and chromatin structure. We present multiple use cases demonstrating the utility of this database for generating novel biological hypotheses, such as chromatin-based determinants of p53 binding and potential cell type-specific p53 activity.

Notable progress has been made although the fragmented way data is reported has reduced their potential impact. Here, we introduce EstroGene2.0, an expanded database of its precursor 1.0 version. EstroGene2.0 focusses on response and resistance to endocrine therapies in breast cancer models. Incorporating multi-omic profiling of 361 experiments from 212 studies across 28 cell lines, a user-friendly browser offers comprehensive data visualization and metadata mining capabilities ( https://estrogeneii.web.app/ ).

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) typically target highly conserved sites on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), which mediate viral entry, and block the infection of diverse HIV-1 strains. But different mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs prevent robust application of bnAbs for therapeutic and preventive interventions.<h4>Results</h4>Here we report the development of a new database that provides data and computational tools to aid the discovery of resistant features and may assist in analysis of HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs. Bioinformatic tools allow identification of specific patterns in Env sequences of resistant strains and development of strategies to elucidate the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape; comparison of resistant and sensitive HIV-1 strains for each bnAb; identification of resistance and sensitivity signatures associated with specific bnAbs or groups of bnAbs; and visualization of antibody pairs on cross-sensitivity plots.

39569321,Exon nomenclature and classification of transcripts database (ENACTdb): a resource for analyzing alternative splicing mediated proteome diversity.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Gene transcripts are distinguished by the composition of their exons, and this different exon composition may contribute to advancing proteome complexity. Despite the availability of alternative splicing information documented in various databases, a ready association of exonic variations to the protein sequence remains a mammoth task.<h4>Results</h4>To associate exonic variation(s) with the protein systematically, we designed the Exon Nomenclature and Classification of Transcripts (ENACT) framework for uniquely annotating exons that tracks their loci in gene architecture context with encapsulating variations in splice site(s) and amino acid coding status. After ENACT annotation, predicted protein features (secondary structure/disorder/Pfam domains) are mapped to exon attributes. Thus, ENACTdb provides trackable exonic variation(s) association to isoform(s) and protein features, enabling the assessment of functional variation due to changes in exon composition. Such analyses can be readily performed through multiple views supported by the server. The exon-centric visualizations of ENACT annotated isoforms could provide insights on the functional repertoire of genes due to alternative splicing and its related processes and can serve as an important resource for the research community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The database is publicly available at https://www.iscbglab.in/enactdb/.

Recently, with the development of next-generation sequencing, a large number of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based gene expression profiles about physical activity have been shared in public resources; however, they are poorly curated and underutilized. To tackle this problem, we developed a data atlas of such data through comprehensive data collection, curation, and organization.<h4>Methods</h4>The data atlas, termed gene expression profiles of RNA-seq-based exercise responses (GEPREP), was built on a comprehensive collection of high-quality RNA-seq data on exercise responses. The metadata of each sample were manually curated. Data were uniformly processed and batch effects corrected. All the information was well organized in an easy-to-use website for free search, visualization, and download.<h4>Results</h4>GEPREP now includes 69 RNA-seq datasets of pre- and post-exercise, comprising 26 human datasets (1120 samples) and 43 mouse datasets (1006 samples).

36179089,CITEdb: a manually curated database of cell-cell interactions in human.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The interactions among various types of cells play critical roles in cell functions and the maintenance of the entire organism. While cell-cell interactions are traditionally revealed from experimental studies, recent developments in single-cell technologies combined with data mining methods have enabled computational prediction of cell-cell interactions, which have broadened our understanding of how cells work together, and have important implications in therapeutic interventions targeting cell-cell interactions for cancers and other diseases. Despite the importance, to our knowledge, there is no database for systematic documentation of high-quality cell-cell interactions at the cell type level, which hinders the development of computational approaches to identify cell-cell interactions.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a publicly accessible database, CITEdb (Cell-cell InTEraction database, https://citedb.cn/), which not only facilitates interactive exploration of cell-cell interactions in specific physiological contexts (e.g. a disease or an organ) but also provides a benchmark dataset to interpret and evaluate computationally derived cell-cell interactions from different tools.

39677536,The FAIR database: facilitating access to public health research literature.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>In public health, access to research literature is critical to informing decision-making and to identify knowledge gaps. However, identifying relevant research is not a straightforward task since public health interventions are often complex, can have positive and negative impacts on health inequalities and are applied in diverse and rapidly evolving settings. We developed a ""living"" database of public health research literature to facilitate access to this information using Natural Language Processing tools.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Classifiers were identified to identify the study design (eg, cohort study or clinical trial) and relationship to factors that may be relevant to inequalities using the PROGRESS-Plus classification scheme. Training data were obtained from existing MEDLINE labels and from a set of systematic reviews in which studies were annotated with PROGRESS-Plus categories.<h4>Results</h4>Evaluation of the classifiers showed that the study type classifier achieved average precision and recall of 0.803 and 0.930, respectively.

However, experimental identification of Nm sites is challenging and resource-intensive. While multiple computational tools have been developed to identify Nm sites, their predictive performance, particularly in terms of precision and generalization capability, remains deficient. We introduced Nmix, an advanced computational tool for precise prediction of Nm sites in human RNA. We constructed the largest, low-redundancy dataset of experimentally verified Nm sites and employed an innovative multi-feature fusion approach, combining one-hot, Z-curve and RNA secondary structure encoding. Nmix utilizes a meticulously designed hybrid deep learning architecture, integrating 1D/2D convolutional neural networks, self-attention mechanism and residual connection. We implemented asymmetric loss function and Bayesian optimization-based ensemble learning, substantially improving predictive performance on imbalanced datasets. Rigorous testing on two benchmark datasets revealed that Nmix significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, particularly in precision, with average improvements of 33.1% and 60.0%, and Matthews correlation coefficient, with average improvements of 24.7% and 51.1%. Notably, Nmix demonstrated exceptional cross-species generalization capability, accurately predicting 93.8% of experimentally verified Nm sites in rat RNA.

DBPs also play essential roles in different kinds of biological activities such as DNA replication, repair, transcription, and splicing. As experimental identification of DBPs is time-consuming and sometimes biased toward prediction, constructing an effective DBP model represents an urgent need, and computational methods that can accurately predict potential DBPs based on sequence information are highly desirable. In this paper, a novel predictor called DeepDNAbP has been developed to accurately predict DBPs from sequences using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. First, we perform three feature extraction methods, namely position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) and tripeptide composition (TPC), to represent protein sequence patterns. Secondly, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are employed to remove the redundant and irrelevant features for predicting DBPs. Finally, the best features are provided to the CNN classifier to construct the DeepDNAbP model for identifying DBPs. The final DeepDNAbP predictor achieves superior prediction performance in K-fold cross-validation tests and outperforms other existing predictors of DNA-protein binding methods.

38411627,PlantFUNCO: Integrative Functional Genomics Database Reveals Clues into Duplicates Divergence Evolution.,"Evolutionary epigenomics and, more generally, evolutionary functional genomics, are emerging fields that study how non-DNA-encoded alterations in gene expression regulation are an important form of plasticity and adaptation. Previous evidence analyzing plants' comparative functional genomics has mostly focused on comparing same assay-matched experiments, missing the power of heterogeneous datasets for conservation inference. To fill this gap, we developed PlantFUN(ctional)CO(nservation) database, which is constituted by several tools and two main resources: interspecies chromatin states and functional genomics conservation scores, presented and analyzed in this work for three well-established plant models (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Zea mays). Overall, PlantFUNCO elucidated evolutionary information in terms of cross-species functional agreement. Therefore, providing a new complementary comparative-genomics source for assessing evolutionary studies. To illustrate the potential applications of this database, we replicated two previously published models predicting genetic redundancy in A. thaliana and found that chromatin states are a determinant of paralogs degree of functional divergence. These predictions were validated based on the phenotypes of mitochondrial alternative oxidase knockout mutants under two different stressors. Taking all the above into account, PlantFUNCO aim to leverage data diversity and extrapolate molecular mechanisms findings from different model organisms to determine the extent of functional conservation, thus, deepening our understanding of how plants epigenome and functional noncoding genome have evolved.

40360995,GEDG: gene expression database of grape.,"<h4>Background</h4>Grapes are one of the oldest cultivated fruit species in the world, known for their high nutritional value. Grapes and grape products, including wine, are significant to many economies worldwide. Both abiotic and biotic stresses significantly impact the growth and reproduction of grapevines. RNA-Seq is a key tool for studying gene expression patterns under various conditions, such as stress responses, growth and developmental stages. In order to optimise the utilisation of these data for comprehensive research and analysis, and to enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a comprehensive database that provides gene expression profiles and traits in grapes.<h4>Description</h4>We have developed the gene expression database for grapes (GEDG), an online resource that encompasses data on 9 types of abiotic (including heat, cold, hormones, light, climate, nitrogen, frozen) and biotic (disease and pests) stresses and different developmental stages. A total of 32 datasets were related to stress, 20 to growth and development, and one to chromosomal ploidy. The primary objective of GEDG is to expand and utilize transcriptome data to better understand stress responses in grapes. GEDG is the comprehensive database to integrate transcriptome and traits on grape.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Gene Expression Database of Grape (GEDG) was created to serve as a free resource platform for researchers, offering a comprehensive collection of genetic expression profiles for grape varieties based on RNA-seq data.

37270525,ABPEPserver: a web application for documentation and analysis of substitutants.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cancer immunotherapy is implemented by identifying antigens that are presented on the cell surface of cancer cells and illicit T-cell response (Schumacher and Schreiber, Science 348:69-74, 2015; Waldman et al., Nat Rev Immunol 20:651-668, 2020; Zhang et al., Front Immunol 12:672,356, 2021b). Classical candidates of such antigens are the peptides resulting from genetic alterations and are named ""neoantigen"" (Schumacher and Schreiber, Science 348:69-74, 2015). Neoantigens have been widely catalogued across several human cancer types (Tan et al., Database (Oxford) 2020;2020b; Vigneron et al., Cancer Immun 13:15, 2013; Yi et al., iScience 24:103,107, 2021; Zhang et al., BMC Bioinformatics 22:40, 2021a). Recently, a new class of inducible antigens has been identified, namely Substitutants, that are produced as a result of aberrant protein translation (Pataskar et al., Nature 603:721-727, 2022). MAIN: Catalogues of Substitutant expression across human cancer types, their specificity and association to gene expression signatures remain elusive for the scientific community's access. As a solution, we present ABPEPserver, an online database and analytical platform that can visualize a large-scale tumour proteomics analysis of Substitutant expression across eight tumour types sourced from the CPTAC database (Edwards et al., J Proteome Res 14:2707-2713, 2015). Functionally, ABPEPserver offers the analysis of gene-association signatures of Substitutant peptides, a comparison of enrichment between tumour and tumour-adjacent normal tissues, and a list of peptides that serve as candidates for immunotherapy design. ABPEPserver will significantly enhance the exploration of aberrant protein production in human cancer, as exemplified in a case study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ABPEPserver is designed on an R SHINY platform to catalogue Substitutant peptides in human cancer.

34933331,TMNP: a transcriptome-based multi-scale network pharmacology platform for herbal medicine.,"One of the most difficult problems that hinder the development and application of herbal medicine is how to illuminate the global effects of herbs on the human body. Currently, the chemo-centric network pharmacology methodology regards herbs as a mixture of chemical ingredients and constructs the 'herb-compound-target-disease' connections based on bioinformatics methods, to explore the pharmacological effects of herbal medicine. However, this approach is severely affected by the complexity of the herbal composition. Alternatively, gene-expression profiles induced by herbal treatment reflect the overall biological effects of herbs and are suitable for studying the global effects of herbal medicine. Here, we develop an online transcriptome-based multi-scale network pharmacology platform (TMNP) for exploring the global effects of herbal medicine. Firstly, we build specific functional gene signatures for different biological scales from molecular to higher tissue levels. Then, specific algorithms are designed to measure the correlations of transcriptional profiles and types of gene signatures. Finally, TMNP uses pharmacotranscriptomics of herbal medicine as input and builds associations between herbs and different biological scales to explore the multi-scale effects of herb medicine. We applied TMNP to a single herb Astragalus membranaceus and Xuesaitong injection to demonstrate the power to reveal the multi-scale effects of herbal medicine. TMNP integrating herbal medicine and multiple biological scales into the same framework, will greatly extend the conventional network pharmacology model centering on the chemical components, and provide a window for systematically observing the complex interactions between herbal medicine and the human body.

34927675,CRPMKB: a knowledge base of cancer risk prediction models for systematic comparison and personalized applications.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>In the era of big data and precision medicine, accurate risk assessment is a prerequisite for the implementation of risk screening and preventive treatment. A large number of studies have focused on the risk of cancer, and related risk prediction models have been constructed, but there is a lack of effective resource integration for systematic comparison and personalized applications. Therefore, the establishment and analysis of the cancer risk prediction model knowledge base (CRPMKB) is of great significance.<h4>Results</h4>The current knowledge base contains 802 model data. The model comparison indicates that the accuracy of cancer risk prediction was greatly affected by regional differences, cancer types and model types. We divided the model variables into four categories: environment, behavioral lifestyle, biological genetics and clinical examination, and found that there are differences in the distribution of various variables among different cancer types. Taking 50 genes involved in the lung cancer risk prediction models as an example to perform pathway enrichment analyses and the results showed that these genes were significantly enriched in p53 Signaling and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling pathways which are associated with cancer and specific diseases. In addition, we verified the biological significance of overlapping lung cancer genes via STRING database. CRPMKB was established to provide researchers an online tool for the future personalized model application and developing. This study of CRPMKB suggests that developing more targeted models based on specific demographic characteristics and cancer types will further improve the accuracy of cancer risk model predictions.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>CRPMKB is freely available at http://www.sysbio.org.cn/CRPMKB/.

36548389,PTMint database of experimentally verified PTM regulation on protein-protein interaction.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Post-translational modification (PTM) is an important biochemical process. which includes six most well-studied types: phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation and glycosylation. PTM is involved in various cell signaling pathways and biological processes. Abnormal PTM status is closely associated with severe diseases (such as cancer and neurologic diseases) by regulating protein functions, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs). A set of databases was constructed separately for PTM sites and PPI; however, the resource of regulation for PTM on PPI is still unsolved.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we firstly constructed a public accessible database of PTMint (PTMs that are associated with PPIs) (https://ptmint.sjtu.edu.cn/) that contains manually curated complete experimental evidence of the PTM regulation on PPIs in multiple organisms, including Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Currently, the first version of PTMint encompassed 2477 non-redundant PTM sites in 1169 proteins affecting 2371 protein-protein pairs involving 357 diseases. Various annotations were systematically integrated, such as protein sequence, structure properties and protein complex analysis.

36991341,CellTrackVis: interactive browser-based visualization for analyzing cell trajectories and lineages.,"<h4>Background</h4>Automatic cell tracking methods enable practitioners to analyze cell behaviors efficiently. Notwithstanding the continuous development of relevant software, user-friendly visualization tools have room for further improvements. Typical visualization mostly comes with main cell tracking tools as a simple plug-in, or relies on specific software/platforms. Although some tools are standalone, limited visual interactivity is provided, or otherwise cell tracking outputs are partially visualized.<h4>Results</h4>This paper proposes a self-reliant visualization system, CellTrackVis, to support quick and easy analysis of cell behaviors. Interconnected views help users discover meaningful patterns of cell motions and divisions in common web browsers. Specifically, cell trajectory, lineage, and quantified information are respectively visualized in a coordinated interface. In particular, immediate interactions among modules enable the study of cell tracking outputs to be more effective, and also each component is highly customizable for various biological tasks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CellTrackVis is a standalone browser-based visualization tool.

37725369,pLM-BLAST: distant homology detection based on direct comparison of sequence representations from protein language models.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The detection of homology through sequence comparison is a typical first step in the study of protein function and evolution. In this work, we explore the applicability of protein language models to this task.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce pLM-BLAST, a tool inspired by BLAST, that detects distant homology by comparing single-sequence representations (embeddings) derived from a protein language model, ProtT5. Our benchmarks reveal that pLM-BLAST maintains a level of accuracy on par with HHsearch for both highly similar sequences (with >50% identity) and markedly divergent sequences (with <30% identity), while being significantly faster. Additionally, pLM-BLAST stands out among other embedding-based tools due to its ability to compute local alignments. We show that these local alignments, produced by pLM-BLAST, often connect highly divergent proteins, thereby highlighting its potential to uncover previously undiscovered homologous relationships and improve protein annotation.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>pLM-BLAST is accessible via the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit as a web server for searching precomputed databases (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/plmblast).

35489067,BusyBee Web: towards comprehensive and differential composition-based metagenomic binning.,"Despite recent methodology and reference database improvements for taxonomic profiling tools, metagenomic assembly and genomic binning remain important pillars of metagenomic analysis workflows. In case reference information is lacking, genomic binning is considered to be a state-of-the-art method in mixed culture metagenomic data analysis. In this light, our previously published tool BusyBee Web implements a composition-based binning method efficient enough to function as a rapid online utility. Handling assembled contigs and long nanopore generated reads alike, the webserver provides a wide range of supplementary annotations and visualizations. Half a decade after the initial publication, we revisited existing functionality, added comprehensive visualizations, and increased the number of data analysis customization options for further experimentation. The webserver now allows for visualization-supported differential analysis of samples, which is computationally expensive and typically only performed in coverage-based binning methods. Further, users may now optionally check their uploaded samples for plasmid sequences using PLSDB as a reference database.

35639928,Shiny GATOM: omics-based identification of regulated metabolic modules in atom transition networks.,"Multiple high-throughput omics techniques provide different angles on systematically quantifying and studying metabolic regulation of cellular processes. However, an unbiased analysis of such data and, in particular, integration of multiple types of data remains a challenge. Previously, for this purpose we developed GAM web-service for integrative metabolic network analysis. Here we describe an updated pipeline GATOM and the corresponding web-service Shiny GATOM, which takes as input transcriptional and/or metabolomic data and finds a metabolic subnetwork most regulated between the two conditions of interest. GATOM features a new metabolic network topology based on atom transition, which significantly improves interpretability of the analysis results. To address computational challenges arising with the new network topology, we introduce a new variant of the maximum weight connected subgraph problem and provide a corresponding exact solver. To make the used networks up-to-date we upgraded the KEGG-based network construction pipeline and developed one based on the Rhea database, which allows analysis of lipidomics data. Finally, we simplified local installation, providing R package mwcsr for solving relevant graph optimization problems and R package gatom, which implements the GATOM pipeline.

35697698,A database of anti-coronavirus peptides.,"Since 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) disease (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide epidemic. Anti-coronavirus peptides (ACovPs), a type of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have demonstrated excellent inhibitory effects on coronaviruses. However, state-of-the-art AMP databases contain only a small number of ACovPs. Additionally, the fields of these databases are not uniform, and the units or evaluation standards of the same field are inconsistent. Most of these databases have not included the target domains of ACovPs and description of in vitro and in vivo assays to measure the inhibitory effects of ACovPs. Here, we present a database focused on ACovPs (ACovPepDB), which contains comprehensive and precise ACovPs information of 518 entries with 214 unique ACovPs manually collected from public databases and published peer-reviewed articles. We believe that ACovPepDB is of great significance for facilitating the development of new peptides and improving treatment for coronavirus infection.

37391755,Meta-research on pragmatism of randomized trials: rationale and design of the PragMeta database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pragmatic trials provide decision-oriented, real-world evidence that is highly applicable and generalizable. The interest in real-world evidence is fueled by the assumption that effects in the ""real-world"" are different to effects obtained under artificial, controlled, research conditions as often used for traditional explanatory trials. However, it is unknown which features of pragmatism, generalizability, and applicability would be responsible for such differences. There is a need to provide empirical evidence and promote meta-research to answer these fundamental questions on the pragmatism of randomized trials and real-world evidence. Here, we describe the rationale and design of the PragMeta database which pursues this goal ( www.PragMeta.org ).<h4>Methods</h4>PragMeta is a non-commercial, open data platform and infrastructure to facilitate research on pragmatic trials. It collects and shares data from published randomized trials that either have a specific design feature or other characteristic related to pragmatism or they form clusters of trials addressing the same research question but having different aspects of pragmatism. This lays the foundation to determine the relationship of various features of pragmatism, generalizability, and applicability with intervention effects or other trial characteristics. The database contains trial data actively collected for PragMeta but also allows to import and link existing datasets of trials collected for other purposes, forming a large-scale meta-database. PragMeta captures data on (1) trial and design characteristics (e.g., sample size, population, intervention/comparison, outcome, longitudinal structure, blinding), (2) effects estimates, and (3) various determinants of pragmatism (e.g., the use of routinely collected data) and ratings from established tools used to determine pragmatism (e.g., the PRagmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary 2; PRECIS-2). PragMeta is continuously provided online, inviting the meta-research community to collaborate, contribute, and/or use the database. As of April 2023, PragMeta contains data from > 700 trials, mostly with assessments on pragmatism.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PragMeta will inform a better understanding of pragmatism and the generation and interpretation of real-world evidence.",True,False,4.0,,,h,16.9863058,ok,,pragmeta | a large-scale | pragmatic-explanatory continuum indicator summary 2 | ragmeta,,v2,0.9863058,Meta-research on pragmatism of randomized trials,True,5.0,False,False,http://www.PragMeta.org,http://www.PragMeta.org,True,,1
37308034,Multi-ethnic Imputation System (MI-System): A genotype imputation server for high-dimensional data.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Genotype imputation is a commonly used technique that infers un-typed variants into a study's genotype data, allowing better identification of causal variants in disease studies. However, due to overrepresentation of Caucasian studies, there's a lack of understanding of genetic basis of health-outcomes in other ethnic populations. Therefore, facilitating imputation of missing key-predictor-variants that can potentially improve a risk health-outcome prediction model, specifically for Asian ancestry, is of utmost relevance.<h4>Methods</h4>We aimed to construct an imputation and analysis web-platform, that primarily facilitates, but is not limited to genotype imputation on East-Asians.

This is the largest normative study conducted so far that relies on subjective ratings. Unlike the few existing normative studies, which mainly comprise face emojis, here we present a wide range of emoji categories. We also examine the correlations between the dimensions assessed. Our results show that, in terms of their affective properties, emojis are analogous to other stimuli, such as words, showing the expected U-shaped relationship between valence and arousal. The relationship between affective properties and other dimensions (e.g., between valence and familiarity) is also similar to the relationship observed in words, in the sense that positively valenced emojis are more familiar than negative ones. These findings suggest that emojis are suitable stimuli for studying affective processing.

36917599,AFTM: a database of transmembrane regions in the human proteome predicted by AlphaFold.,"Transmembrane proteins (TMPs), with diverse cellular functions, are difficult targets for structural determination. Predictions of TMPs and the locations of transmembrane segments using computational methods could be unreliable due to the potential for false positives and false negatives and show inconsistencies across different programs. Recent advances in protein structure prediction methods have made it possible to identify TMPs and their membrane-spanning regions using high-quality structural models. We developed the AlphaFold Transmembrane proteins (AFTM) database of candidate human TMPs by identifying transmembrane regions in AlphaFold structural models of human proteins and their domains using the positioning of proteins in membranes, version 3 program, followed by automatic corrections inspired by manual analysis of the results. We compared our results to annotations from the UniProt database and the Human Transmembrane Proteome (HTP) database. While AFTM did not identify transmembrane regions in some single-pass TMPs, it identified more transmembrane regions for multipass TMPs than UniProt and HTP. AFTM also showed more consistent results with experimental structures, as benchmarked against the Protein Data Bank Transmembrane proteins (PDBTM) database. In addition, some proteins previously annotated as TMPs were suggested to be non-TMPs by AFTM. We report the results of AFTM together with those of UniProt, HTP, TmAlphaFold, PDBTM and Membranome in the online AFTM database compiled as a comprehensive resource of candidate human TMPs with structural models.

38491365,NeuronBridge: an intuitive web application for neuronal morphology search across large data sets.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neuroscience research in Drosophila is benefiting from large-scale connectomics efforts using electron microscopy (EM) to reveal all the neurons in a brain and their connections. To exploit this knowledge base, researchers relate a connectome's structure to neuronal function, often by studying individual neuron cell types. Vast libraries of fly driver lines expressing fluorescent reporter genes in sets of neurons have been created and imaged using confocal light microscopy (LM), enabling the targeting of neurons for experimentation. However, creating a fly line for driving gene expression within a single neuron found in an EM connectome remains a challenge, as it typically requires identifying a pair of driver lines where only the neuron of interest is expressed in both. This task and other emerging scientific workflows require finding similar neurons across large data sets imaged using different modalities.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present NeuronBridge, a web application for easily and rapidly finding putative morphological matches between large data sets of neurons imaged using different modalities. We describe the functionality and construction of the NeuronBridge service, including its user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), extensible data model, serverless cloud architecture, and massively parallel image search engine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>NeuronBridge fills a critical gap in the Drosophila research workflow and is used by hundreds of neuroscience researchers around the world.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information's Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) is a public repository for scientific data sharing. To support curation of thousands of complex data sets, dbGaP has detailed submission instructions that investigators must follow when archiving their data.<h4>Results</h4>We developed dbGaPCheckup, an R package which implements a series of check, awareness, reporting, and utility functions to support data integrity and proper formatting of the subject phenotype data set and data dictionary prior to dbGaP submission. For example, as a tool, dbGaPCheckup ensures that the data dictionary contains all fields required by dbGaP, and additional fields required by dbGaPCheckup; the number and names of variables match between the data set and data dictionary; there are no duplicated variable names or descriptions; observed data values are not more extreme than the logical minimum and maximum values stated in the data dictionary; and more. The package also includes functions that implement a series of minor/scalable fixes when errors are detected (e.g., a function to reorder the variables in the data dictionary to match the order listed in the data set). Finally, we also include reporting functions that produce graphical and textual descriptives of the data to further reduce the likelihood of data integrity issues.

35306140,LTM-TCM: A comprehensive database for the linking of Traditional Chinese Medicine with modern medicine at molecular and phenotypic levels.,"Benefiting from the development of network pharmacology, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) shows great potential in modern drug discovery. Recently, more and more TCM-related databases have been established for both academic and industry research, but they are still insufficient in data standardization, integrity, and precision. To better accelerate the TCM research and overcome these shortcomings, we construct a web-based TCM platform, LTM-TCM, which is currently the most comprehensive TCM database that includes the following advantages: (1) High-quality data integration from fourteen TCM authoritative databases, especially with additional manual collected 41,025 clinical treatment records and 213 ancient Chinese medical books. (2) Accurate correction of multi-source TCM interactions (between symptoms, prescriptions, herbs, ingredients and targets) through in-house Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) approaches in more than 30 million articles. (3) Diverse cross-field pipelines (e.g., bioactive ingredients screening, targets prediction, and mechanism prediction, etc.) help integrating traditional medicine with modern science in common aspects at both the molecular and phenotypic levels. In summary, LTM-TCM contains 1928 symptoms, 48,126 prescriptions, 9122 plants, 34,967 ingredients, 13,109 targets and 1170,133 interactions among all TCM related components.

37925500,MCF2Chem: A manually curated knowledge base of biosynthetic compound production.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microbes have been used as cell factories to synthesize various chemical compounds. Recent advances in synthetic biological technologies have accelerated the increase in the number and capacity of microbial cell factories; the variety and number of synthetic compounds produced via these cell factories have also grown substantially. However, no database is available that provides detailed information on the microbial cell factories and the synthesized compounds.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we established MCF2Chem, a manually curated knowledge base on the production of biosynthetic compounds using microbial cell factories. It contains 8888 items of production records related to 1231 compounds that were synthesizable by 590 microbial cell factories, including the production data of compounds (titer, yield, productivity, and content), strain culture information (culture medium, carbon source/precursor/substrate), fermentation information (mode, vessel, scale, and condition), and other information (e.g., strain modification method). The database contains statistical analyses data of compounds and microbial species. The data statistics of MCF2Chem showed that bacteria accounted for 60% of the species and that ""fatty acids"", ""terpenoids"", and ""shikimates and phenylpropanoids"" accounted for the top three chemical products. Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Corynebacterium glutamicum synthesized 78% of these chemical compounds. Furthermore, we constructed a system to recommend microbial cell factories suitable for synthesizing target compounds and vice versa by combining MCF2Chem data, additional strain- and compound-related data, the phylogenetic relationships between strains, and compound similarities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MCF2Chem provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing detailed statistical information on microbial cell factories and their synthesizable compounds.

39493756,Idbview: a database and interactive platform for respiratory-associated disease.,"Public databases have become invaluable resources for disease research, particularly in the realm of identifying and validating biomarkers, thus playing a significant role in enhancing our understanding of respiratory diseases. To facilitate this understanding, the development of user-friendly analytical tools and advanced systematic models that leverage the growing omics data and clinical information datasets is essential. Despite the importance of such resources, the research progress related to respiratory diseases is hindered by the absence of a centralized platform housing easily accessible datasets and accompanying visualization tools. In an effort to streamline and standardize information sharing across diverse respiratory research initiatives, we introduce Idbview, a specialized digital database focusing on respiratory conditions, offering interactive visualization functionalities powered by both Vue and R Shiny applications. Idbview brings together clinical data and various omics datasets, serving as a centralized repository, while also providing users with a suite of interactive tools to analyze and visualize data from multiple perspectives.

Three pathway databases are now supported: KEGG, Reactome and MapMan, providing more comprehensive pathway knowledge for animals and plants. New metabolite analysis methods fill gaps in traditional pathway-based enrichment methods. The metabolite hub analysis selects compounds with a high number of significant genes in their neighbouring network, suggesting regulation by gene expression changes. The metabolite class activity analysis tests the hypothesis that a metabolic class has a higher-than-expected proportion of significant elements, indicating that these compounds are regulated in the experiment. Finally, PaintOmics 4 includes a regulatory omics module to analyse the contribution of trans-regulatory layers (microRNA and transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins) to regulate pathways.

36515985,"The injured sciatic nerve atlas (iSNAT), insights into the cellular and molecular basis of neural tissue degeneration and regeneration.","Upon trauma, the adult murine peripheral nervous system (PNS) displays a remarkable degree of spontaneous anatomical and functional regeneration. To explore extrinsic mechanisms of neural repair, we carried out single-cell analysis of naïve mouse sciatic nerve, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and crushed sciatic nerves at 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days following injury. During the first week, monocytes and macrophages (Mo/Mac) rapidly accumulate in the injured nerve and undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming. Proinflammatory Mo/Mac with a high glycolytic flux dominate the early injury response and rapidly give way to inflammation resolving Mac, programmed toward oxidative phosphorylation. Nerve crush injury causes partial leakiness of the blood-nerve barrier, proliferation of endoneurial and perineurial stromal cells, and entry of opsonizing serum proteins. Micro-dissection of the nerve injury site and distal nerve, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing, identified distinct immune compartments, triggered by mechanical nerve wounding and Wallerian degeneration, respectively. This finding was independently confirmed with <i>Sarm1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, in which Wallerian degeneration is greatly delayed. Experiments with chimeric mice showed that wildtype immune cells readily enter the injury site in <i>Sarm1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, but are sparse in the distal nerve, except for Mo. We used CellChat to explore intercellular communications in the naïve and injured PNS and report on hundreds of ligand-receptor interactions. Our longitudinal analysis represents a new resource for neural tissue regeneration, reveals location- specific immune microenvironments, and reports on large intercellular communication networks.

39372719,PotatoG-DKB: a potato gene-disease knowledge base mined from biological literature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Potato is the fourth largest food crop in the world, but potato cultivation faces serious threats from various diseases and pests. Despite significant advancements in research on potato disease resistance, these findings are scattered across numerous publications. For researchers, obtaining relevant knowledge by reading and organizing a large body of literature is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Therefore, systematically extracting and organizing the relationships between potato genes and diseases from the literature to establish a potato gene-disease knowledge base is particularly important. Unfortunately, there is currently no such gene-disease knowledge base available.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we constructed a Potato Gene-Disease Knowledge Base (PotatoG-DKB) using natural language processing techniques and large language models. We used PubMed as the data source and obtained 2,906 article abstracts related to potato biology, extracted entities and relationships between potato genes and related disease, and stored them in a Neo4j database.

Darling can detect sentence-based cooccurrences of biomedical entities such as genes, proteins, chemicals, functions, tissues, diseases, environments, and phenotypes from biomedical literature found in six disease-centric databases. In this version, we deploy additional query channels focusing on COVID-19, GWAS studies, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and cancer diseases. Compared to its predecessor, users now have extended query options including searches with PubMed identifiers, disease records, entity names, titles, single nucleotide polymorphisms, or the Entrez syntax. Furthermore, after applying named entity recognition, one can retrieve and mine the relevant literature from recognized terms for a free input text. Term associations are captured in customizable networks which can be further filtered by either term or co-occurrence frequency and visualized in 2D as weighted graphs or in 3D as multi-layered networks. The fetched terms are organized in searchable tables and clustered annotated documents. The reported genes can be further analyzed for functional enrichment using external applications called from within Darling.

34991446,ASAP 2: a pipeline and web server to analyze marker gene amplicon sequencing data automatically and consistently.,"<h4>Background</h4>Amplicon sequencing of marker genes such as 16S rDNA have been widely used to survey and characterize microbial community. However, the complex data analyses have required many interfering manual steps often leading to inconsistencies in results.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we have developed a pipeline, amplicon sequence analysis pipeline 2 (ASAP 2), to automate and glide through the processes without the usual manual inspections and user's interference, for instance, in the detection of barcode orientation, selection of high-quality region of reads, and determination of resampling depth and many more. The pipeline integrates all the analytical processes such as importing data, demultiplexing, summarizing read profiles, trimming quality, denoising, removing chimeric sequences and making the feature table among others. The pipeline accepts multiple file formats as input including multiplexed or demultiplexed, paired-end or single-end, barcode inside or outside and raw or intermediate data (e.g. feature table). The outputs include taxonomic classification, alpha/beta diversity, community composition, ordination analysis and statistical tests. ASAP 2 supports merging multiple sequencing runs which helps integrate and compare data from different sources (public databases and collaborators).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our pipeline minimizes hands-on interference and runs amplicon sequence variant (ASV)-based amplicon sequencing analysis automatically and consistently.

35230424,"DSDBASE 2.0: updated version of DiSulphide dataBASE, a database on disulphide bonds in proteins.","Disulphide bonds are stabilizing crosslinks in proteins and serve to enhance their thermal stability. In proteins that are small and rich in disulphide bonds, they could be the major determining factor for the choice of conformational state since their constraints on appropriate backbone conformation can be substantial. Such crosslinks and their positional conservation could itself enable protein family and functional association. Despite the importance of the field, there is no comprehensive database on disulphide crosslinks that is available to the public. Herein we provide information on disulphides in DSDBASE2.0, an updated and significantly expanded database that is freely available, fully annotated and manually curated database on native and modelled disulphides. The web interface also provides several useful computational tools that have been specifically developed for proteins containing disulphide crosslinks. The modelling of disulphide crosslinks is performed using stereochemical criteria, coded within our Modelling of Disulphides in Proteins (MODIP) algorithm. The inclusion of modelled disulphides potentially enhances the loop database substantially, thereby permitting the recognition of compatible polypeptide segments that could serve as templates for immediate modelling.

36764355,InParanoiDB 9: Ortholog Groups for Protein Domains and Full-Length Proteins.,"Prediction of orthologs is an important bioinformatics pursuit that is frequently used for inferring protein function and evolutionary analyses. The InParanoid database is a well known resource of ortholog predictions between a wide variety of organisms. Although orthologs have historically been inferred at the level of full-length protein sequences, many proteins consist of several independent protein domains that may be orthologous to domains in other proteins in a way that differs from the full-length protein case. To be able to capture all types of orthologous relations, conventional full-length protein orthologs can be complemented with orthologs inferred at the domain level. We here present InParanoiDB 9, covering 640 species and providing orthologs for both protein domains and full-length proteins. InParanoiDB 9 was built using the faster InParanoid-DIAMOND algorithm for orthology analysis, as well as Domainoid and Pfam to infer orthologous domains. InParanoiDB 9 is based on proteomes from 447 eukaryotes, 158 bacteria and 35 archaea, and includes over one billion predicted ortholog groups.

39788736,rRFtargetDB: a database of Ago1-mediated targets of ribosomal RNA fragments.,"rRNA-derived fragments (rRFs) are a class of emerging posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression likely binding to the transcripts of target genes. However, the lack of knowledge about such targets hinders our understanding of rRF functions or binding mechanisms. The paucity of resources supporting the identification of the targets of rRFs creates a bottleneck in the fast-developing field. We have previously analyzed chimeric reads in cross-linked Argonaute1-RNA complexes to help infer the guide-target pairs and binding mechanisms of multiple rRFs based on experimental data in human HEK293 cells. To efficiently disseminate these results to the research community, we designed a web-based database rRFtargetDB that preserves most of the experimental results after the removal of noise and has a user-friendly interface with flexible query options and filters allowing users to obtain comprehensive information on rRFs (or targets) of interest. rRFtargetDB is populated by ∼163,000 experimentally determined unique rRF-mRNA pairs (∼60,000 supported by ≥2 reads). Almost 30,000 rRF isoforms produced >385,000 (>156,000 with ≥2 reads) chimeras with all types of RNA targets (mRNAs and noncoding RNAs). Further analyses suggested hypothetical modes of interactions, supported by secondary structures of potential guide-target hybrids and binding motifs, essential for understanding the targeting mechanisms of rRFs. All these results (ranging from the weakest to the strongest experimental support) are presented in rRFtargetDB, whose goal is to provide a resource for building users' hypotheses on the potential roles of rRFs for experimental validation.

37924118,Annotation of cell types (ACT): a convenient web server for cell type annotation.,"<h4>Background</h4>The advancement of single-cell sequencing has progressed our ability to solve biological questions. Cell type annotation is of vital importance to this process, allowing for the analysis and interpretation of enormous single-cell datasets. At present, however, manual cell annotation which is the predominant approach remains limited by both speed and the requirement of expert knowledge.<h4>Methods</h4>To address these challenges, we constructed a hierarchically organized marker map through manually curating over 26,000 cell marker entries from about 7000 publications. We then developed WISE, a weighted and integrated gene set enrichment method, to integrate the prevalence of canonical markers and ordered differentially expressed genes of specific cell types in the marker map. Benchmarking analysis suggested that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods.<h4>Results</h4>By integrating the marker map and WISE, we developed a user-friendly and convenient web server, ACT ( http://xteam.xbio.top/ACT/ or http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/ACT/ ), which only takes a simple list of upregulated genes as input and provides interactive hierarchy maps, together with well-designed charts and statistical information, to accelerate the assignment of cell identities and made the results comparable to expert manual annotation. Besides, a pan-tissue marker map was constructed to assist in cell assignments in less-studied tissues. Applying ACT to three case studies showed that all cell clusters were quickly and accurately annotated, and multi-level and more refined cell types were identified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a knowledge-based resource and a corresponding method, together with an intuitive graphical web interface, for cell type annotation.

36652461,A modERN resource: identification of Drosophila transcription factor candidate target genes using RNAi.,"Transcription factors (TFs) play a key role in development and in cellular responses to the environment by activating or repressing the transcription of target genes in precise spatial and temporal patterns. In order to develop a catalog of target genes of Drosophila melanogaster TFs, the modERN consortium systematically knocked down the expression of TFs using RNAi in whole embryos followed by RNA-seq. We generated data for 45 TFs which have 18 different DNA-binding domains and are expressed in 15 of the 16 organ systems. The range of inactivation of the targeted TFs by RNAi ranged from log2fold change -3.52 to +0.49.

35164668,D3PM: a comprehensive database for protein motions ranging from residue to domain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Knowledge of protein motions is significant to understand its functions. While currently available databases for protein motions are mostly focused on overall domain motions, little attention is paid on local residue motions. Albeit with relatively small scale, the local residue motions, especially those residues in binding pockets, may play crucial roles in protein functioning and ligands binding.<h4>Results</h4>A comprehensive protein motion database, namely D3PM, was constructed in this study to facilitate the analysis of protein motions. The protein motions in the D3PM range from overall structural changes of macromolecule to local flip motions of binding pocket residues. Currently, the D3PM has collected 7679 proteins with overall motions and 3513 proteins with pocket residue motions. The motion patterns are classified into 4 types of overall structural changes and 5 types of pocket residue motions. Impressively, we found that less than 15% of protein pairs have obvious overall conformational adaptations induced by ligand binding, while more than 50% of protein pairs have significant structural changes in ligand binding sites, indicating that ligand-induced conformational changes are drastic and mainly confined around ligand binding sites. Based on the residue preference in binding pocket, we classified amino acids into ""pocketphilic"" and ""pocketphobic"" residues, which should be helpful for pocket prediction and drug design.<h4>Conclusion</h4>D3PM is a comprehensive database about protein motions ranging from residue to domain, which should be useful for exploring diverse protein motions and for understanding protein function and drug design.

36239113,NBLAST: a graphical user interface-based two-way BLAST software with a dot plot viewer.,"BLAST, a basic bioinformatics tool for searching local sequence similarity, has been one of the most widely used bioinformatics programs since its introduction in 1990. Users generally use the web-based NCBI-BLAST program for BLAST analysis. However, users with large sequence data are often faced with a problem of upload size limitation while using the web-based BLAST program. This proves inconvenient as scientists often want to run BLAST on their own data, such as transcriptome or whole genome sequences. To overcome this issue, we developed NBLAST, a graphical user interface-based BLAST program that employs a two-way system, allowing the use of input sequences either as ""query"" or ""target"" in the BLAST analysis. NBLAST is also equipped with a dot plot viewer, thus allowing researchers to create custom database for BLAST and run a dot plot similarity analysis within a single program.

However, conventional formulation studies still strongly rely on personal experiences by trial-and-error experiments, resulting in a labor-consuming, tedious and costly pipeline. Thus, it is highly required to develop intelligent and efficient methods for formulation development to keep pace with the progress of the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we developed a comprehensive web-based platform (FormulationAI) for in silico formulation design. First, the most comprehensive datasets of six widely used drug formulation systems in the pharmaceutical industry were collected over 10 years, including cyclodextrin formulation, solid dispersion, phospholipid complex, nanocrystals, self-emulsifying and liposome systems. Then, intelligent prediction and evaluation of 16 important properties from the six systems were investigated and implemented by systematic study and comparison of different AI algorithms and molecular representations. Finally, an efficient prediction platform was established and validated, which enables the formulation design just by inputting basic information of drugs and excipients.

40584559,"KSGP 3.1: improved taxonomic annotation of Archaea communities using LotuS2, the genome taxonomy database and RNAseq data.","Taxonomic annotation is a substantial challenge for Archaea metabarcoding. A limited number of reference sequences are available; a substantial fraction of phylogenetic diversity is not fully characterized; widely used databases do not reflect current archaeal taxonomy and contain mislabelled sequences. We address these gaps with a systematic and tractable approach based around the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) combined with the eukaryote PR2 and MIDORI mitochondrial databases. After removing incongruent, chimeric and duplicate SSU sequences, this combination (<i>GTDB+</i>) provides a small improvement in annotation of a set of estuarine Archaea Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) compared to SILVA. We add to this a collection of near full length rRNA sequences and the prokaryote SSU sequences in SILVA, creating a new reference database, KSGP ( <b><i>K</i></b> arst, <b><i>S</i></b> ilva, <b><i>G</i></b> TDB, and <b>P</b>R2). The additional sequences are (re-)annotated using three different approaches. The most conservative, using lowest common ancestor, gives a further small improvement. Annotation using SINTAX increases Class and Order assignments by 2.7 and 4.2 times over SILVA, although this may include some ""lumping"" of un-named and named clades. Still further improvement can be made using similarity based clustering to group database sequences into putative taxa at all taxonomic levels, assigning 60% and 41% of Archaea OTUs to putative family and genus level taxa respectively.

38063081,"MLOsMetaDB, a meta-database to centralize the information on liquid-liquid phase separation proteins and membraneless organelles.","Over the past few years, there has been a focus on proteins that create separate liquid phases in the intracellular liquid environment, known as membraneless organelles (MLOs). These organelles allow for the spatiotemporal associations of macromolecules that dynamically exchange within the cellular milieu. They provide a form of compartmentalization crucial for organizing key functions in many cells. Metabolic processes and signaling pathways in both the cytoplasm and nucleus are among the functions performed by MLOs, which are facilitated by diverse combinations of proteins and nucleic acids. However, disruptions in these liquid-liquid phase separation processes (LLPS) may lead to several diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, among others. To foster the study of this process and MLO function, we present MLOsMetaDB (http://mlos.leloir.org.ar), a comprehensive resource of information on MLO- and LLPS-related proteins. Our database integrates and centralizes available information for every protein involved in MLOs, which is otherwise disseminated across a plethora of different databases. Our manuscript outlines the development and features of MLOsMetaDB, which provides an interactive and user-friendly environment with modern biological visualizations and easy and quick access to proteins based on LLPS role, MLO location, and organisms. In addition, it offers an advanced search for making complex queries to generate customized information.

39215721,AnnoDUF: A Web-Based Tool for Annotating Functions of Proteins Having Domains of Unknown Function.,"The rapid expansion of biological sequence databases due to high-throughput genomic and proteomic sequencing methods has left a considerable number of identified protein sequences with unclear or incomplete functional annotations. Domains of unknown function (DUFs) are protein domains that lack functional annotations but are present in numerous proteins. To address the challenge of finding functional annotations for DUFs, we have developed a computational method that efficiently identifies and annotates these enigmatic protein domains by utilizing the position-specific iterative basic local alignment search tool (PSI-BLAST) and data mining techniques. Our pipeline identifies putative potential functionalities of DUFs, thereby decreasing the gap between known sequences and functions. The tool can also take user input sequences to annotate. We executed our pipeline on 5111 unique DUF sequences obtained from Pfam, resulting in putative annotations for 2007 of these. These annotations were subsequently incorporated into a comprehensive database and interfaced with a web-based server named ""AnnoDUF"". AnnoDUF is freely accessible to both academic and industrial users, via the World Wide Web at the link http://bts.ibab.ac.in/annoduf.php.

38709889,SHAPEwarp-web: sequence-agnostic search for structurally homologous RNA regions across databases of chemical probing data.,"RNA molecules perform a variety of functions in cells, many of which rely on their secondary and tertiary structures. Chemical probing methods coupled with high-throughput sequencing have significantly accelerated the mapping of RNA structures, and increasingly large datasets of transcriptome-wide RNA chemical probing data are becoming available. Analogously to what has been done for decades in the protein world, this RNA structural information can be leveraged to aid the discovery of structural similarity to a known RNA (or RNA family), which, in turn, can inform about the function of transcripts. We have previously developed SHAPEwarp, a sequence-agnostic method for the search of structurally homologous RNA segments in a database of reactivity profiles derived from chemical probing experiments. In its original implementation, however, SHAPEwarp required substantial computational resources, even for moderately sized databases, as well as significant Linux command line know-how. To address these limitations, we introduce here SHAPEwarp-web, a user-friendly web interface to rapidly query large databases of RNA chemical probing data for structurally similar RNAs.

However, utilizing these data resources is challenging for wet-lab researchers. A comprehensive platform for exploring single-cell multi-omics data related to reproduction is urgently needed. Here, we introduce the single-cell multi-omics atlas of reproduction (SMARTdb), an integrative and user-friendly platform for exploring molecular dynamics of reproductive development, aging, and disease, which covers multi-omics, multi-species, and multi-stage data. We curated and analyzed single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data of over 2.0 million cells from 6 species across the entire lifespan. A series of powerful functionalities are provided, such as ""Query gene expression"", ""DIY expression plot"", ""DNA methylation plot"", and ""Epigenome browser"". With SMARTdb, we found that the male germ cell-specific expression pattern of RPL39L and RPL10L is conserved between human and other model animals. Moreover, DNA hypomethylation and open chromatin may collectively regulate the specific expression pattern of RPL39L in both male and female germ cells.

39066515,"CO-19 PDB 2.0: A Comprehensive COVID-19 Database with Global Auto-Alerts, Statistical Analysis, and Cancer Correlations.","Biological databases serve as critical basics for modern research, and amid the dynamic landscape of biology, the COVID-19 database has emerged as an indispensable resource. The global outbreak of Covid-19, commencing in December 2019, necessitates comprehensive databases to unravel the intricate connections between this novel virus and cancer. Despite existing databases, a crucial need persists for a centralized and accessible method to acquire precise information within the research community. The main aim of the work is to develop a database which has all the COVID-19-related data available in just one click with auto global notifications. This gap is addressed by the meticulously designed COVID-19 Pandemic Database (CO-19 PDB 2.0), positioned as a comprehensive resource for researchers navigating the complexities of COVID-19 and cancer. Between December 2019 and June 2024, the CO-19 PDB 2.0 systematically collected and organized 120 datasets into six distinct categories, each catering to specific functionalities. These categories encompass a chemical structure database, a digital image database, a visualization tool database, a genomic database, a social science database, and a literature database. Functionalities range from image analysis and gene sequence information to data visualization and updates on environmental events. CO-19 PDB 2.0 has the option to choose either the search page for the database or the autonotification page, providing a seamless retrieval of information. The dedicated page introduces six predefined charts, providing insights into crucial criteria such as the number of cases and deaths', country-wise distribution, 'new cases and recovery', and rates of death and recovery. The global impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients has led to extensive collaboration among research institutions, producing numerous articles and computational studies published in international journals. A key feature of this initiative is auto daily notifications for standardized information updates. Users can easily navigate based on different categories or use a direct search option. The study offers up-to-date COVID-19 datasets and global statistics on COVID-19 and cancer, highlighting the top 10 cancers diagnosed in the USA in 2022.

38532317,COSAP: Comparative Sequencing Analysis Platform.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent improvements in sequencing technologies enabled detailed profiling of genomic features. These technologies mostly rely on short reads which are merged and compared to reference genome for variant identification. These operations should be done with computers due to the size and complexity of the data. The need for analysis software resulted in many programs for mapping, variant calling and annotation steps. Currently, most programs are either expensive enterprise software with proprietary code which makes access and verification very difficult or open-access programs that are mostly based on command-line operations without user interfaces and extensive documentation. Moreover, a high level of disagreement is observed among popular mapping and variant calling algorithms in multiple studies, which makes relying on a single algorithm unreliable. User-friendly open-source software tools that offer comparative analysis are an important need considering the growth of sequencing technologies.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we propose Comparative Sequencing Analysis Platform (COSAP), an open-source platform that provides popular sequencing algorithms for SNV, indel, structural variant calling, copy number variation, microsatellite instability and fusion analysis and their annotations. COSAP is packed with a fully functional user-friendly web interface and a backend server which allows full independent deployment for both individual and institutional scales. COSAP is developed as a workflow management system and designed to enhance cooperation among scientists with different backgrounds.

35609985,enrichMiR predicts functionally relevant microRNAs based on target collections.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are among the main post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. A number of data collections and prediction tools have gathered putative or confirmed targets of these regulators. It is often useful, for discovery and validation, to harness such collections to perform target enrichment analysis in given transcriptional signatures or gene-sets in order to predict involved miRNAs. While several methods have been proposed to this end, a flexible and user-friendly interface for such analyses using various approaches and collections is lacking. enrichMiR (https://ethz-ins.org/enrichMiR/) addresses this gap by enabling users to perform a series of enrichment tests, based on several target collections, to rank miRNAs according to their likely involvement in the control of a given transcriptional signature or gene-set. enrichMiR results can furthermore be visualised through interactive and publication-ready plots.

Recent studies have indicated that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can not only reverse the resistance to cancer therapy but also are crucial biomarkers for the evaluation and prediction of CTRR. Herein, we developed CTRR-ncRNA, a knowledgebase of CTRR-associated ncRNAs, aiming to provide an accurate and comprehensive resource for research involving the association between CTRR and ncRNAs. Compared to most of the existing cancer databases, CTRR-ncRNA is focused on the clinical characterization of cancers, including cancer subtypes, as well as survival outcomes and responses to personalized therapy of cancer patients. Information pertaining to biomarker ncRNAs has also been documented for the development of personalized CTRR prediction. A user-friendly interface and several functional modules have been incorporated into the database. Based on the preliminary analysis of genotype-phenotype relationships, universal ncRNAs have been found to be potential biomarkers for CTRR.

We conducted nearly 1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) ε4/ε4, and TREM2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400 cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in AD.<h4>Results</h4>All results are integrated into TACA (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive visualization tools for AD.<h4>Discussion</h4>We envision that TACA will be a highly valuable resource for both basic and translational research in AD, as it provides abundant information for AD pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for drug discovery.<h4>Highlights</h4>We compiled an Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain cell atlas consisting of more than 1.1 million cells/nuclei transcriptomes from 26 data sets, covering major brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and cell types (e.g., neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia).We conducted over 1400 differential expression (DE) comparisons to identify cell type-specific gene expression alterations.

36412325,Acinetobase: the comprehensive database and repository of Acinetobacter strains.,"Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most problematic nosocomial pathogens that can efficiently thrive within hospital settings, mainly due to resistances toward antibiotics, desiccation, disinfectants, human serum and oxidative stress. Recently, increased resistance against last-resort antibiotics earns this bacterium the highest priority concern classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. An obvious hallmark of this bacterium is the high heterogeneity observed among A. baumannii isolates, with a limited core genome. This feature complexifies the study of A. baumannii bacteria as an entity, subsequently reflected in a diversity of phenotypes of not only antimicrobial and environmental resistance but also virulence. A high degree of genome plasticity, along with the use of a limited subset of established strains, can lead to strain-specific observations, decreasing the global understanding of this pathogenic agent. Phenotypic variability of A. baumannii strains is easily observable such as with the macrocolony morphologies, in vitro and in vivo virulence, natural competence level, production of different capsular polysaccharide structures and cellular densities. Some strains encode an extensive amount of virulence factors, while others, including the established strains, lack several key ones. The lack/excess of genes or specific physiological processes might interfere with in vivo and in vitro experiments, thus providing a limited impact on the global understanding of Acinetobacter bacteria. As an answer to the high heterogeneity among A. baumannii strains, we propose a first comprehensive database that includes the bacterial strains and the associated phenotypic and genetic data.

35614210,MRA Toolbox v. 1.0: a web-based toolbox for predicting mixture toxicity of chemical substances in chemical products.,"The chemical risk assessment paradigm is shifting from ""substance-based"" to ""product/mixture-based"" and from ""animal testing"" to ""alternative testing"" under chemical regulations. Organisms and the environment may be exposed to mixtures rather than a single substance. Conducting toxicity tests for all possible combinations is impractical due to the enormous combinatorial complexity. This study highlights the development and application case studies of Mixture Risk Assessment Toolbox, a novel web-based platform that supports mixture risk assessment through the use of different prediction models and public databases. This integrated framework provides new functional values for assessors to easily screen and compare the toxicity of mixture products using different computational techniques and find strategic solutions to reduce the mixture toxicity in the product development process.

36477806,The conserved domain database in 2023.,"NLM's conserved domain database (CDD) is a collection of protein domain and protein family models constructed as multiple sequence alignments. Its main purpose is to provide annotation for protein and translated nucleotide sequences with the location of domain footprints and associated functional sites, and to define protein domain architecture as a basis for assigning gene product names and putative/predicted function. CDD has been available publicly for over 20 years and has grown substantially during that time. Maintaining an archive of pre-computed annotation continues to be a challenge and has slowed down the cadence of CDD releases. CDD curation staff builds hierarchical classifications of large protein domain families, adds models for novel domain families via surveillance of the protein 'dark matter' that currently lacks annotation, and now spends considerable effort on providing names and attribution for conserved domain architectures.

38192372,Deep-HPI-pred: An R-Shiny applet for network-based classification and prediction of Host-Pathogen protein-protein interactions.,"Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) are vital in numerous biological activities and are intrinsically linked to the onset and progression of infectious diseases. HPIs are pivotal in the entire lifecycle of diseases: from the onset of pathogen introduction, navigating through the mechanisms that bypass host cellular defenses, to its subsequent proliferation inside the host. At the heart of these stages lies the synergy of proteins from both the host and the pathogen. By understanding these interlinking protein dynamics, we can gain crucial insights into how diseases progress and pave the way for stronger plant defenses and the swift formulation of countermeasures. In the framework of current study, we developed a web-based R/Shiny app, Deep-HPI-pred, that uses network-driven feature learning method to predict the yet unmapped interactions between pathogen and host proteins. Leveraging citrus and <i>C</i>Las bacteria training datasets as case study, we spotlight the effectiveness of Deep-HPI-pred in discerning Protein-protein interaction (PPIs) between them. Deep-HPI-pred use Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models for HPI prediction, which is based on a comprehensive evaluation of topological features and neural network architectures. When subjected to independent validation datasets, the predicted models consistently surpassed a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.80 in host-pathogen interactions. Remarkably, the use of Eigenvector Centrality as the leading topological feature further enhanced this performance. Further, Deep-HPI-pred also offers relevant gene ontology (GO) term information for each pathogen and host protein within the system. This protein annotation data contributes an additional layer to our understanding of the intricate dynamics within host-pathogen interactions. In the additional benchmarking studies, the Deep-HPI-pred model has proven its robustness by consistently delivering reliable results across different host-pathogen systems, including plant-pathogens (accuracy of 98.4% and 97.9%), human-virus (accuracy of 94.3%), and animal-bacteria (accuracy of 96.6%) interactomes. These results not only demonstrate the model's versatility but also pave the way for gaining comprehensive insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex host-pathogen interactions.

It comprises two types, esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), with Barrett's esophagus (BE) being the only known precursor. Recent research has revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the development, prognosis and treatment of EC and are involved in various human diseases. Biological databases have become essential for cancer research as they provide information on genes, proteins, pathways and their interactions. These databases collect, store and manage large amounts of molecular data, which can be used to identify patterns, predict outcomes and generate hypotheses. However, no comprehensive database exists for EC and miRNA relationships. To address this gap, we developed a dynamic database named 'ESOMIR (miRNA in esophageal cancer) (https://esomir.dqweilab-sjtu.com)', which includes information about targeted genes and miRNAs associated with EC. The database uses analysis and prediction methods, including experimentally endorsed miRNA(s) information.

A key topic discussed was the frequent variability in results obtained between different microbial WGS-related AMR gene prediction workflows. Further, comparative benchmarking studies are difficult to perform due to differences in AMR gene prediction accuracy and a lack of agreement in the naming of AMR genes (semantic conformity) for the results obtained. To illustrate this problem, and as a capacity-building exercise to encourage stakeholder involvement, a comparative Galaxy-based BenchAMRking platform was developed and validated using datasets from bacterial species with PCR-verified AMR gene presence or absence information from abritAMR.<h4>Results</h4>The Galaxy-based BenchAMRking platform ( https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/benchAMRking/ ) specifically focusses on the steps involved in identifying AMR genes from raw reads and sequence assemblies.

We now introduce BEAGLE 2.0, a web server designed to facilitate the search for structural similarities between user-provided RNA molecules and an expanded collection of RNA secondary structure datasets. These datasets include structures derived from SHAPE experiments in Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It also incorporates predicted structures from the NONCODE database for a wide range of animals and plants, as well as a dataset of structures based on constraints derived from conserved positions within the families present in Rfam. Users can input RNA sequences or a combination of sequences and secondary structures in either dot-bracket or BEAR format. BEAGLE 2.0 outputs pairwise alignments with measures of structural similarity and statistical significance. Additionally, it offers a visual representation of the secondary structures, with structural elements highlighted in different colors. Overall, BEAGLE 2.0 enables searches in RNA structure datasets leveraging experimentally supported data, to identify structural similarities in RNAs of interest.

36950105,COVID-19Base v3: Update of the knowledgebase for drugs and biomedical entities linked to COVID-19.,"COVID-19 has taken a huge toll on our lives over the last 3 years. Global initiatives put forward by all stakeholders are still in place to combat this pandemic and help us learn lessons for future ones. While the vaccine rollout was not able to curb the spread of the disease for all strains, the research community is still trying to develop effective therapeutics for COVID-19. Although Paxlovid and remdesivir have been approved by the FDA against COVID-19, they are not free of side effects. Therefore, the search for a therapeutic solution with high efficacy continues in the research community. To support this effort, in this latest version (v3) of COVID-19Base, we have summarized the biomedical entities linked to COVID-19 that have been highlighted in the scientific literature after the vaccine rollout. Eight different topic-specific dictionaries, i.e., gene, miRNA, lncRNA, PDB entries, disease, alternative medicines registered under clinical trials, drugs, and the side effects of drugs, were used to build this knowledgebase. We have introduced a BLSTM-based deep-learning model to predict the drug-disease associations that outperforms the existing model for the same purpose proposed in the earlier version of COVID-19Base. For the very first time, we have incorporated disease-gene, disease-miRNA, disease-lncRNA, and drug-PDB associations covering the largest number of biomedical entities related to COVID-19.

However, data-dependent acquisition (DDA) remains the most widespread acquisition mode for untargeted LC-MS/MS-based lipidomics. Here, we present LipidMS 3.0, an R package that not only adds DDA and new lipid classes to its pipeline but also the required functionalities to cover the whole data analysis workflow from pre-processing (i.e. peak-peaking, alignment and grouping) to lipid annotation.<h4>Results</h4>We applied the new workflow in the data analysis of a commercial human serum pool spiked with 68 representative lipid standards acquired in full scan, DDA and DIA modes. When focusing on the detected lipid standard features and total identified lipids, LipidMS 3.0 data pre-processing performance is similar to XCMS, whereas it complements the annotations returned by MS-DIAL, providing a higher level of structural information and a lower number of incorrect annotations.

39704703,ssMutPA: single-sample mutation-based pathway analysis approach for cancer precision medicine.,"<h4>Background</h4>Single-sample pathway enrichment analysis is an effective approach for identifying cancer subtypes and pathway biomarkers, facilitating the development of precision medicine. However, the existing approaches focused on investigating the changes in gene expression levels but neglected somatic mutations, which play a crucial role in cancer development.<h4>Findings</h4>In this study, we proposed a novel single-sample mutation-based pathway analysis approach (ssMutPA) to infer individualized pathway activities by integrating somatic mutation data and the protein-protein interaction network. For each sample, ssMutPA first uses local and global weighted strategies to evaluate the effects of genes from mutations according to the network topology and then calculates a single-sample mutation-based pathway enrichment score (ssMutPES) to reflect the accumulated effect of mutations of each pathway. To illustrate the performance of ssMutPA, we applied it to 33 cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and revealed patient stratification with significantly different prognosis in each cancer type based on the ssMutPES profiles. We also found that the identified characteristic pathways with high overlap across different cancers could be used as potential prognosis biomarkers. Moreover, we applied ssMutPA to 2 melanoma cohorts with immunotherapy and identified a subgroup of patients who may benefit from therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We provided evidence that ssMutPA could infer mutation-based individualized pathway activity profiles and complement the current individualized pathway analysis approaches focused on gene expression data, which may offer the potential for the development of precision medicine. ssMutPA is available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssMutPA.",True,False,3.0,,ssmutpa,,16.95346546,ok,,the cancer genome atlas,smutpa,v2,0.95346546,ssMutPA,False,0.0,True,False,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssMutPA,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssMutPA,True,...nt of precision medicine. ssMutPA is available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ssMutPA.,1

Here we introduce CODD-Pred (COmprehensive Drug Design Predictor), an online web server with well-curated data sets from the GOSTAR database, which is designed with a dual purpose of predicting potential protein drug targets and computing bioactivity values of small molecules. We first designed a double molecular graph perception (DMGP) framework for target prediction based on a large library of 646 498 small molecules interacting with 640 human targets. The framework achieved a top-5 accuracy of over 80% for hitting at least one target on both external validation sets. Additionally, its performance on the external validation set comprising 200 molecules surpassed that of four existing target prediction servers. Second, we collected 56 targets closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer, metabolic diseases, and inflammatory immune diseases and developed a multi-model self-validation activity prediction (MSAP) framework that enables accurate bioactivity quantification predictions for small-molecule ligands of these 56 targets. CODD-Pred is a handy tool for rapid evaluation and optimization of small molecules with specific target activity.

38868513,CBD2: A functional biomarker database for colorectal cancer.,"The rapidly evolving landscape of biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) necessitates an integrative, updated repository. In response, we constructed the Colorectal Cancer Biomarker Database (CBD), which collected and displayed the curated biomedicine information for 870 CRC biomarkers in the previous study. Building on CBD, we have now developed CBD2, which includes information on 1569 newly reported biomarkers derived from different biological sources (DNA, RNA, protein, and others) and clinical applications (diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis). CBD2 also incorporates information on nonbiomarkers that have been identified as unsuitable for use as biomarkers in CRC. A key new feature of CBD2 is its network analysis function, by which users can investigate the visible and topological network between biomarkers and identify their relevant pathways. CBD2 also allows users to query a series of chemicals, drug combinations, or multiple targets, to enable multidrug, multitarget, multipathway analyses, toward facilitating the design of polypharmacological treatments for CRC.

The data update contains Allosteric Signalling Maps (ASMs) and Allosteric Probing Maps (APMs) quantifying allosteric effects of mutations and of small probe binding, respectively. To ensure quality of the ASMs and APMs, we performed careful and accurate selection of protein sets containing high-quality predicted structures in both databases for each organism/structure, and the data is available for browsing and download. The data for remaining structures are available for download and should be used at user's discretion and responsibility. We believe these massive data can facilitate both diagnostics and drug design within the precision medicine paradigm. Specifically, it can be instrumental in the analysis of allosteric effects of pathological and rescue mutations, providing starting points for fragment-based design of allosteric effectors.

Previously, we introduced FlyPhoneDB, a tool designed to explore CCC in <i>Drosophila</i> single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. The core algorithm of FlyPhoneDB infers tissue-specific signaling events between cell types by calculating cell-cell interaction scores based on curated ligand-receptor (L-R) expression across major signaling pathways. However, the utility of FlyPhoneDB was limited by the relatively small number of available L-R pairs. Here, we present FlyPhoneDB2, a major upgrade featuring a significantly expanded knowledgebase that includes a greater number of L-R pairs, incorporating annotations from mammalian species and structural predictions from AlphaFold-Multimer. In addition, the algorithm has been optimized for improved performance and more effective noise filtering. New functionalities have also been introduced, such as the addition of downstream reporter genes to evaluate pathway activity, multi-sample CCC comparison, and enhanced visualizations summarizing communication at a network level. We demonstrate the utility of FlyPhoneDB2 by analyzing whole-body single-nuclei RNA-seq datasets from flies with gut tumors induced by the Yorkie oncogene. We show that FlyPhoneDB2 not only recapitulates established biological insights into the <i>Drosophila</i> Yorkie tumor model, but also identifies novel potential L-R pairs that may play important roles in tumor-induced cachexia.

38204359,piOxi database: a web resource of germline and somatic tissue piRNAs identified by chemical oxidation.,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that are highly expressed and extensively studied from the germline. piRNAs associate with PIWI proteins to maintain DNA methylation for transposon silencing and transcriptional gene regulation for genomic stability. Mature germline piRNAs have distinct characteristics including a 24- to 32-nucleotide length and a 2'-O-methylation signature at the 3' end. Although recent studies have identified piRNAs in somatic tissues, they remain poorly characterized. For example, we recently demonstrated notable expression of piRNA in the murine soma, and while overall expression was lower than that of the germline, unique characteristics suggested tissue-specific functions of this class. While currently available databases commonly use length and association with PIWI proteins to identify piRNA, few have included a chemical oxidation method that detects piRNA based on its 3' modification. This method leads to reproducible and rigorous data processing when coupled with next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Here, we introduce piOxi DB, a user-friendly web resource that provides a comprehensive analysis of piRNA, generated exclusively through sodium periodate treatment of small RNA. The current version of piOxi DB includes 435 749 germline and 9828 somatic piRNA sequences robustly identified from M. musculus, M. fascicularis and H. sapiens.

Millions of high-confidence RNA editing sites have been identified and integrated into various RNA databases, providing a convenient platform for the rapid identification of key drivers of cancer and potential therapeutic targets. However, the available database for integration of RNA editing in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic malignancies is still lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 29 leukemia patients and 19 healthy donors from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and RNA-seq data of 12 mouse hematopoietic cell populations obtained from our previous research were also used. We performed sequence alignment, identified RNA editing sites, and obtained characteristic editing sites related to normal hematopoietic development and abnormal editing sites associated with hematologic diseases.<h4>Results</h4>We established a new database, ""REDH"", represents RNA editome in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancy.

35025997,LLPSDB v2.0: an updated database of proteins undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Emerging evidences have suggested that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins plays a vital role both in a wide range of biological processes and in related diseases. Whether a protein undergoes phase separation not only is determined by the chemical and physical properties of biomolecule themselves, but also is regulated by environmental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, pH, as well as volume excluded by other macromolecules. A web accessible database LLPSDB was developed recently by our group, in which all the proteins involved in LLPS in vitro as well as corresponding experimental conditions were curated comprehensively from published literatures. With the rapid increase of investigations in biomolecular LLPS and growing popularity of LLPSDB, we updated the database, and developed a new version LLPSDB v2.0. In comparison of the previously released version, more than double contents of data are curated, and a new class 'Ambiguous system' is added. In addition, the web interface is improved, such as that users can search the database by selecting option 'phase separation status' alone or combined with other options.

39163546,GMMID: genetically modified mice information database.,"Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are vital for elucidating gene function and disease mechanisms. An overwhelming number of GEMM lines have been generated, but endeavors to collect and organize the information of these GEMMs are seriously lagging behind. Only a few databases are developed for the information of current GEMMs, and these databases lack biological descriptions of allele compositions, which poses a challenge for nonexperts in mouse genetics to interpret the genetic information of these mice. Moreover, these databases usually do not provide information on human diseases related to the GEMM, which hinders the dissemination of the insights the GEMM provides as a human disease model. To address these issues, we developed an algorithm to annotate all the allele compositions that have been reported with Python programming and have developed the genetically modified mice information database (GMMID; http://www.gmmid.cn), a user-friendly database that integrates information on GEMMs and related diseases from various databases, including National Center for Biotechnology Information, Mouse Genome Informatics, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, and Jax lab. GMMID provides comprehensive genetic information on >70 055 alleles, 65 520 allele compositions, and ∼4000 diseases, along with biologically meaningful descriptions of alleles and allele combinations.

39237205,CAPRI-Q: The CAPRI resource evaluating the quality of predicted structures of protein complexes.,"Protein interactions are essential for cellular processes. In recent years there has been significant progress in computational prediction of 3D structures of individual protein chains, with the best-performing algorithms reaching sub-Ångström accuracy. These techniques are now finding their way into the prediction of protein interactions, adding to the existing modeling approaches. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) has been a catalyst for the development of procedures for the structural modeling of protein assemblies by organizing blind prediction experiments. The predicted structures are assessed against unpublished experimentally determined structures using a set of metrics with proven robustness that have been established in the CAPRI community. In addition, several advanced benchmarking databases provide targets against which users can test docking and assembly modeling software. These include the Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark, the CAPRI Scoreset, and the Dockground database, all developed by members of the CAPRI community. Here we present CAPRI-Q, a stand-alone model quality assessment tool, which can be freely downloaded or used via a publicly available web server. This tool applies the CAPRI metrics to assess the quality of query structures against given target structures, along with other popular quality metrics such as DockQ, TM-score and l-DDT, and classifies the models according to the CAPRI model quality criteria. The tool can handle a variety of protein complex types including those involving peptides, nucleic acids, and oligosaccharides.

DHARANI features 5132 Nissl, hematoxylin and eosin stained, 20 µm coronal and sagittal sections, postmortem MRI, and a neuroanatomical atlas with 466 annotated sections covering ∼500 brain structures. It is accessible online at https://brainportal.humanbrain.in/publicview/index.html. The 3D reconstruction enables a volumetric view of the fetal brain, allowing visualization in all three planes akin to MRI, previously unachievable with histological datasets from the fetal brain. This allowed qualitative assessment of the growth of brain regions and layers throughout the second trimester. ""DHARANI"" documents the initiation of sulci, with the lateral fissure, calcarine, parieto-occipital, and cingulate sulci, at 14 GW. The central and postcentral sulci appear by 24 GW; however, cytoarchitectonic boundaries become visible before sulcal patterns. Cortical plate (CP) lamination begins at 24 GW in the parietal and occipital cortices. The frontal cortex lacks lamination at 24 GW, although putative Betz cells are already visible and show early patterning in the intermediate zone. The cell-sparse layer between the CP and subplate, containing late migratory neurons, begins in the orbital cortex at 14 GW and reaches the frontal cortex by 17 GW. The appearance of the honeycomb pattern in the occipital and parietal cortex occurs after 14 GW.

39380205,Nphos: Database and Predictor of Protein N-phosphorylation.,"Protein N-phosphorylation is widely present in nature and participates in various biological processes. However, current knowledge on N-phosphorylation is extremely limited compared to that on O-phosphorylation. In this study, we collected 11,710 experimentally verified N-phosphosites of 7344 proteins from 39 species and subsequently constructed the database Nphos to share up-to-date information on protein N-phosphorylation. Upon these substantial data, we characterized the sequential and structural features of protein N-phosphorylation. Moreover, after comparing hundreds of learning models, we chose and optimized gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models to predict three types of human N-phosphorylation, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 90.56%, 91.24%, and 92.01% for pHis, pLys, and pArg, respectively. Meanwhile, we discovered 488,825 distinct N-phosphosites in the human proteome. The models were also deployed in Nphos for interactive N-phosphosite prediction. In summary, this work provides new insights and points for both flexible and focused investigations of N-phosphorylation. It will also facilitate a deeper and more systematic understanding of protein N-phosphorylation modification by providing a data and technical foundation.

39673440,MOLGENIS Armadillo: a lightweight server for federated analysis using DataSHIELD.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Extensive human health data from cohort studies, national registries, and biobanks can reveal lifecourse risk factors impacting health. Combining these sources offers increased statistical power, rare outcome detection, replication of findings, and extended study periods. Traditionally, this required data transfer to a central location or separate partner analyses with pooled summary statistics, posing ethical, legal, and time constraints. Federated analysis-which involves remote data analysis without sharing individual-level data-is a promising alternative. One promising solution is DataSHIELD (https://datashield.org/), an open-source R based implementation. To enable federated analysis, data owners need a user-friendly way to install the federated infrastructure and manage users and data. Here, we present MOLGENIS Armadillo: a lightweight server for federated analysis solutions such as DataSHIELD.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Armadillo is implemented as a collection of three packages freely available under the open source licence LGPLv3: two R packages downloadable from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (""MolgenisArmadillo"" and ""DSMolgenisArmdillo"") and one Java application (""ArmadilloService"") as jar and docker images via Github (https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-service-armadillo).",True,False,5.0,,rmadillo,,16.94493157,ok,,datashield | comprehensive r archive network | molgenisarmadillo | armadilloservice | https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-service-armadillo | molgenis armadillo,molgenis,v2,0.94493157,MOLGENIS Armadillo,True,5.0,False,False,https://datashield.org/,https://datashield.org/,True,"...lternative.

36806692,MGnify Genomes: A Resource for Biome-specific Microbial Genome Catalogues.,"An increasingly common output arising from the analysis of shotgun metagenomic datasets is the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), with tens of thousands of MAGs now described in the literature. However, the discovery and comparison of these MAG collections is hampered by the lack of uniformity in their generation, annotation and storage. To address this, we have developed MGnify Genomes, a growing collection of biome-specific non-redundant microbial genome catalogues generated using MAGs and publicly available isolate genomes. Genomes within a biome-specific catalogue are organised into species clusters. For species that contain multiple conspecific genomes, the highest quality genome is selected as the representative, always prioritising an isolate genome over a MAG. The species representative sequences and annotations can be visualised on the MGnify website and the full catalogue and associated analysis outputs can be downloaded from MGnify servers. A suite of online search tools is provided allowing users to compare their own sequences, ranging from a gene to sets of genomes, against the catalogues. Seven biomes are available currently, comprising over 300,000 genomes that represent 11,048 non-redundant species, and include 36 taxonomic classes not currently represented by cultured genomes.

40135505,MUTATE: a human genetic atlas of multiorgan artificial intelligence endophenotypes using genome-wide association summary statistics.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into imaging genetics to provide intermediate phenotypes (i.e. endophenotypes) that bridge the genetics and clinical manifestations of human disease. However, the genetic architecture of these AI endophenotypes remains largely unexplored in the context of human multiorgan system diseases. Using publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UK Biobank (UKBB), FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we comprehensively depicted the genetic architecture of 2024 multiorgan AI endophenotypes (MAEs). We comparatively assessed the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability, polygenicity, and natural selection signatures of 2024 MAEs using methods commonly used in the field. Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses reveal both within-organ relationships and cross-organ interconnections. Bi-directional causal relationships were established between chronic human diseases and MAEs across multiple organ systems, including Alzheimer's disease for the brain, diabetes for the metabolic system, asthma for the pulmonary system, and hypertension for the cardiovascular system. Finally, we derived polygenic risk scores for the 2024 MAEs for individuals not used to calculate MAEs and returned these to the UKBB. Our findings underscore the promise of the MAEs as new instruments to ameliorate overall human health.

35610055,Dali server: structural unification of protein families.,"Protein structure is key to understanding biological function. Structure comparison deciphers deep phylogenies, providing insight into functional conservation and functional shifts during evolution. Until recently, structural coverage of the protein universe was limited by the cost and labour involved in experimental structure determination. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning revolutionized structural bioinformatics by providing accurate structural models of numerous protein families for which no structural information existed. The Dali server for 3D protein structure comparison is widely used by crystallographers to relate new structures to pre-existing ones. Here, we report two most recent upgrades to the web server: (i) the foldomes of key organisms in the AlphaFold Database (version 1) are searchable by Dali, (ii) structural alignments are annotated with protein families. Using these new features, we discovered a novel functionally diverse subgroup within the WRKY/GCM1 clan. This was accomplished by linking the structurally characterized SWI/SNF and NAM families as well as the structural models of the CG-1 family and uncharacterized proteins to the structure of Gti1/Pac2, a previously known member of the WRKY/GCM1 clan.

38330823,Deciphering the comprehensive knowledgebase landscape featuring infertility with IDDB Xtra.,"Infertility affects ∼15% of couples globally and half of cases are related to genetic disorders. Despite growing data and unprecedented improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies, accumulated fertility-related issues concerning genetic diagnosis and potential treatment are urgent to be solved. However, there is a lack of comprehensive platforms that characterise various infertility-related records to provide research applications for exploring infertility in-depth and genetic counselling of infertility couple. To solve this problem, we provide IDDB Xtra by further integrating phenotypic manifestations, genomic datasets, epigenetics, modulators in collaboration with numerous interactive tools into our previous infertility database, IDDB. IDDB Xtra houses manually-curated 2369 genes of human and nine model organisms, 273 chromosomal abnormalities, 884 phenotypes, 60 genomic datasets, 464 epigenetic records, 1144 modulators relevant to infertility diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, IDDB Xtra incorporated customized graphical applications for researchers and clinicians to decipher in-depth disease mechanisms from the perspectives of developmental atlas, mutation effects, and clinical manifestations. Users can browse genes across developmental stages of human and mouse, filter candidate genes, mine potential variants and retrieve infertility biomedical network in an intuitive web interface. In summary, IDDB Xtra not only captures valuable research and data, but also provides useful applications to facilitate the genetic counselling and drug discovery of infertility.

36401317,MarineMetagenomeDB: a public repository for curated and standardized metadata for marine metagenomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metagenomics is an expanding field within microbial ecology, microbiology, and related disciplines. The number of metagenomes deposited in major public repositories such as Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and Metagenomic Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) is rising exponentially. However, data mining and interpretation can be challenging due to mis-annotated and misleading metadata entries. In this study, we describe the Marine Metagenome Metadata Database (MarineMetagenomeDB) to help researchers identify marine metagenomes of interest for re-analysis and meta-analysis. To this end, we have manually curated the associated metadata of several thousands of microbial metagenomes currently deposited at SRA and MG-RAST.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 125 terms were curated according to 17 different classes (e.g., biome, material, oceanic zone, geographic feature and oceanographic phenomena). Other standardized features include sample attributes (e.g., salinity, depth), sample location (e.g., latitude, longitude), and sequencing features (e.g., sequencing platform, sequence count). MarineMetagenomeDB version 1.0 contains 11,449 marine metagenomes from SRA and MG-RAST distributed across all oceans and several seas. Most samples were sequenced using Illumina sequencing technology (84.33%). More than 55% of the samples were collected from the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. About 40% of the samples had their biomes assigned as 'ocean'. The 'Quick Search' and 'Advanced Search' tabs allow users to use different filters to select samples of interest dynamically in the web app. The interactive map allows the visualization of samples based on their location on the world map. The web app is also equipped with a novel download tool (on both Windows and Linux operating systems), that allows easy download of raw sequence data of selected samples from their respective repositories. As a use case, we demonstrated how to use the MarineMetagenomeDB web app to select estuarine metagenomes for potential large-scale microbial biogeography studies.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The MarineMetagenomeDB is a powerful resource for non-bioinformaticians to find marine metagenome samples with curated metadata and stimulate meta-studies involving marine microbiomes.

40056431,Pipeline to explore information on genome editing using large language models and genome editing meta-database.,"Genome editing (GE) is widely recognized as an effective and valuable technology in life sciences research. However, certain genes are difficult to edit depending on some factors such as the type of species, sequences, and GE tools. Therefore, confirming the presence or absence of GE practices in previous publications is crucial for the effective designing and establishment of research using GE. Although the Genome Editing Meta-database (GEM: https://bonohu.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/gem/) aims to provide as comprehensive GE information as possible, it does not indicate how each registered gene is involved in GE. In this study, we developed a systematic method for extracting essential GE information using large language models from the information based on GEM and GE-related articles. This approach allows for a systematic and efficient investigation of GE information that cannot be achieved using the current GEM alone. In addition, by converting the extracted GE information into metrics, we propose a potential application of this method to prioritize genes for future research. The extracted GE information and novel GE-related scores are expected to facilitate the efficient selection of target genes for GE and support the design of research using GE.

36503126,iHypoxia: An Integrative Database of Protein Expression Dynamics in Response to Hypoxia in Animals.,"Mammals have evolved mechanisms to sense hypoxia and induce hypoxic responses. Recently, high-throughput techniques have greatly promoted global studies of protein expression changes during hypoxia and the identification of candidate genes associated with hypoxia-adaptive evolution, which have contributed to the understanding of the complex regulatory networks of hypoxia. In this study, we developed an integrated resource for the expression dynamics of proteins in response to hypoxia (iHypoxia), and this database contains 2589 expression events of 1944 proteins identified by low-throughput experiments (LTEs) and 422,553 quantitative expression events of 33,559 proteins identified by high-throughput experiments from five mammals that exhibit a response to hypoxia. Various experimental details, such as the hypoxic experimental conditions, expression patterns, and sample types, were carefully collected and integrated. Furthermore, 8788 candidate genes from diverse species inhabiting low-oxygen environments were also integrated. In addition, we conducted an orthologous search and computationally identified 394,141 proteins that may respond to hypoxia among 48 animals. An enrichment analysis of human proteins identified from LTEs shows that these proteins are enriched in certain drug targets and cancer genes. Annotation of known posttranslational modification (PTM) sites in the proteins identified by LTEs reveals that these proteins undergo extensive PTMs, particularly phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation. iHypoxia provides a convenient and user-friendly method for users to obtain hypoxia-related information of interest.

36266726,CASA: a comprehensive database resource for the COVID-19 Alternative Splicing Atlas.,"<h4>Background</h4>As a key process in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, alternative splicing (AS) plays a crucial role in maintaining the diversity of RNA and protein expression, and mediates the immune response in infectious diseases, especially for the COVID-19. Therefore, urgent data gathering and more research of AS profiles in microbe-infected human cells are needed to improve understanding of COVID-19 and related infectious diseases. Herein, we have created CASA, the COVID-19 Alternative Splicing Atlas to provide a convenient computing platform for studies of AS in COVID-19 and COVID-19-related infectious diseases.<h4>Methods</h4>In CASA, we reanalyzed thousands of RNA-seq datasets generated from 65 different tissues, organoids and cell lines to systematically obtain quantitative data on AS events under different conditions. A total of 262,994 AS events from various infectious diseases with differing severity were detected and visualized in this database. In order to explore the potential function of dynamics AS events, we performed analysis of functional annotations and drug-target interactions affected by AS in each dataset. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which may regulate these dynamic AS events are also provided for users in this database.<h4>Results</h4>CASA displays microbe-induced alterations of the host cell splicing landscape across different virus families and helps users identify condition-specific splicing patterns, as well as their potential regulators.

39240325,SAAMBE-MEM: a sequence-based method for predicting binding free energy change upon mutation in membrane protein-protein complexes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mutations in protein-protein interactions can affect the corresponding complexes, impacting function and potentially leading to disease. Given the abundance of membrane proteins, it is crucial to assess the impact of mutations on the binding affinity of these proteins. Although several methods exist to predict the binding free energy change due to mutations in protein-protein complexes, most require structural information of the protein complex and are primarily trained on the SKEMPI database, which is composed mainly of soluble proteins.<h4>Results</h4>A novel sequence-based method (SAAMBE-MEM) for predicting binding free energy changes (ΔΔG) in membrane protein-protein complexes due to mutations has been developed. This method utilized the MPAD database, which contains binding affinities for wild-type and mutant membrane protein complexes. A machine learning model was developed to predict ΔΔG by leveraging features such as amino acid indices and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM). Through extensive dataset curation and feature extraction, SAAMBE-MEM was trained and validated using the XGBoost regression algorithm. The optimal feature set, including PSSM-related features, achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.64, outperforming existing methods trained on the SKEMPI database. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that SAAMBE-MEM performs much better when utilizing evolution-based features in contrast to physicochemical features.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method is accessible via a web server and standalone code at http://compbio.clemson.edu/SAAMBE-MEM/.

38172657,ReUseData: an R/Bioconductor tool for reusable and reproducible genomic data management.,"<h4>Background</h4>The increasing volume and complexity of genomic data pose significant challenges for effective data management and reuse. Public genomic data often undergo similar preprocessing across projects, leading to redundant or inconsistent datasets and inefficient use of computing resources. This is especially pertinent for bioinformaticians engaged in multiple projects. Tools have been created to address challenges in managing and accessing curated genomic datasets, however, the practical utility of such tools becomes especially beneficial for users who seek to work with specific types of data or are technically inclined toward a particular programming language. Currently, there exists a gap in the availability of an R-specific solution for efficient data management and versatile data reuse.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present ReUseData, an R software tool that overcomes some of the limitations of existing solutions and provides a versatile and reproducible approach to effective data management within R. ReUseData facilitates the transformation of ad hoc scripts for data preprocessing into Common Workflow Language (CWL)-based data recipes, allowing for the reproducible generation of curated data files in their generic formats. The data recipes are standardized and self-contained, enabling them to be easily portable and reproducible across various computing platforms. ReUseData also streamlines the reuse of curated data files and their integration into downstream analysis tools and workflows with different frameworks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ReUseData provides a reliable and reproducible approach for genomic data management within the R environment to enhance the accessibility and reusability of genomic data.

39875867,Marigold: a machine learning-based web app for zebrafish pose tracking.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput behavioral analysis is important for drug discovery, toxicological studies, and the modeling of neurological disorders such as autism and epilepsy. Zebrafish embryos and larvae are ideal for such applications because they are spawned in large clutches, develop rapidly, feature a relatively simple nervous system, and have orthologs to many human disease genes. However, existing software for video-based behavioral analysis can be incompatible with recordings that contain dynamic backgrounds or foreign objects, lack support for multiwell formats, require expensive hardware, and/or demand considerable programming expertise. Here, we introduce Marigold, a free and open source web app for high-throughput behavioral analysis of embryonic and larval zebrafish.<h4>Results</h4>Marigold features an intuitive graphical user interface, tracks up to 10 user-defined keypoints, supports both single- and multiwell formats, and exports a range of kinematic parameters in addition to publication-quality data visualizations. By leveraging a highly efficient, custom-designed neural network architecture, Marigold achieves reasonable training and inference speeds even on modestly powered computers lacking a discrete graphics processing unit. Notably, as a web app, Marigold does not require any installation and runs within popular web browsers on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. To demonstrate Marigold's utility, we used two sets of biological experiments. First, we examined novel aspects of the touch-evoked escape response in techno trousers (tnt) mutant embryos, which contain a previously described loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Eaat2b, a glial glutamate transporter. We identified differences and interactions between touch location (head vs. tail) and genotype. Second, we investigated the effects of feeding on larval visuomotor behavior at 5 and 7 days post-fertilization (dpf). We found differences in the number and vigor of swimming bouts between fed and unfed fish at both time points, as well as interactions between developmental stage and feeding regimen.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In both biological experiments presented here, the use of Marigold facilitated novel behavioral findings. Marigold's ease of use, robust pose tracking, amenability to diverse experimental paradigms, and flexibility regarding hardware requirements make it a powerful tool for analyzing zebrafish behavior, especially in low-resource settings such as course-based undergraduate research experiences.

36257484,Ori-Finder 2022: A Comprehensive Web Server for Prediction and Analysis of Bacterial Replication Origins.,"The replication of DNA is a complex biological process that is essential for life. Bacterial DNA replication is initiated at genomic loci referred to as replication origins (oriCs). Integrating the Z-curve method, DnaA box distribution, and comparative genomic analysis, we developed a web server to predict bacterial oriCs in 2008 called Ori-Finder, which is helpful to clarify the characteristics of bacterial oriCs. The oriCs of hundreds of sequenced bacterial genomes have been annotated in the genome reports using Ori-Finder and the predicted results have been deposited in DoriC, a manually curated database of oriCs. This has facilitated large-scale data mining of functional elements in oriCs and strand-biased analysis. Here, we describe Ori-Finder 2022 with updated prediction framework, interactive visualization module, new analysis module, and user-friendly interface. More species-specific indicator genes and functional elements of oriCs are integrated into the updated framework, which has also been redesigned to predict oriCs in draft genomes. The interactive visualization module displays more genomic information related to oriCs and their functional elements.

38862427,Q-BioLiP: A Comprehensive Resource for Quaternary Structure-based Protein-ligand Interactions.,"Since its establishment in 2013, BioLiP has become one of the widely used resources for protein-ligand interactions. Nevertheless, several known issues occurred with it over the past decade. For example, the protein-ligand interactions are represented in the form of single chain-based tertiary structures, which may be inappropriate as many interactions involve multiple protein chains (known as quaternary structures). We sought to address these issues, resulting in Q-BioLiP, a comprehensive resource for quaternary structure-based protein-ligand interactions. The major features of Q-BioLiP include: (1) representing protein structures in the form of quaternary structures rather than single chain-based tertiary structures; (2) pairing DNA/RNA chains properly rather than separation; (3) providing both experimental and predicted binding affinities; (4) retaining both biologically relevant and irrelevant interactions to alleviate the wrong justification of ligands' biological relevance; and (5) developing a new quaternary structure-based algorithm for the modelling of protein-ligand complex structure. With these new features, Q-BioLiP is expected to be a valuable resource for studying biomolecule interactions, including protein-small molecule interaction, protein-metal ion interaction, protein-peptide interaction, protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA/RNA interaction, and RNA-small molecule interaction.

37871106,A web-based platform for the annotation and analysis of NAR-published databases.,"Biological databases are essential resources for life science research, but finding and selecting the most relevant and up-to-date databases can be challenging due to the large number and diversity of available databases. The Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) journal publishes annual database issues that provide a comprehensive list of databases in the molecular biology domain. However, the information provided by NAR is limited and sometimes does not reflect the current status and quality of the databases. In this article, we present a web-based platform for the annotation and analysis of NAR-published databases. The platform allows users to manually curate and enrich the NAR entries with additional information such as availability, downloadability, source code links, cross-references, and duplicates. Statistics and visualizations on various aspects of the database landscape, such as recency, status, category, and curation history are also provided.

39487448,The Amphibian Genomics Consortium: advancing genomic and genetic resources for amphibian research and conservation.,"Amphibians represent a diverse group of tetrapods, marked by deep divergence times between their three systematic orders and families. Studying amphibian biology through the genomics lens increases our understanding of the features of this animal class and that of other terrestrial vertebrates. The need for amphibian genomic resources is more urgent than ever due to the increasing threats to this group. Amphibians are one of the most imperiled taxonomic groups, with approximately 41% of species threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, changes in land use patterns, disease, climate change, and their synergistic effects. Amphibian genomic resources have provided a better understanding of ontogenetic diversity, tissue regeneration, diverse life history and reproductive modes, anti-predator strategies, and resilience and adaptive responses. They also serve as essential models for studying broad genomic traits, such as evolutionary genome expansions and contractions, as they exhibit the widest range of genome sizes among all animal taxa and possess multiple mechanisms of genetic sex determination. Despite these features, genome sequencing of amphibians has significantly lagged behind that of other vertebrates, primarily due to the challenges of assembling their large, repeat-rich genomes and the relative lack of societal support. The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, combined with advanced molecular and computational techniques that improve scaffolding and reduce computational workloads, is now making it possible to address some of these challenges. To promote and accelerate the production and use of amphibian genomics research through international coordination and collaboration, we launched the Amphibian Genomics Consortium (AGC, https://mvs.unimelb.edu.au/amphibian-genomics-consortium ) in early 2023. This burgeoning community already has more than 282 members from 41 countries. The AGC aims to leverage the diverse capabilities of its members to advance genomic resources for amphibians and bridge the implementation gap between biologists, bioinformaticians, and conservation practitioners.

38894604,FP-Zernike: An Open-source Structural Database Construction Toolkit for Fast Structure Retrieval.,"The release of AlphaFold2 has sparked a rapid expansion in protein model databases. Efficient protein structure retrieval is crucial for the analysis of structure models, while measuring the similarity between structures is the key challenge in structural retrieval. Although existing structure alignment algorithms can address this challenge, they are often time-consuming. Currently, the state-of-the-art approach involves converting protein structures into three-dimensional (3D) Zernike descriptors and assessing similarity using Euclidean distance. However, the methods for computing 3D Zernike descriptors mainly rely on structural surfaces and are predominantly web-based, thus limiting their application in studying custom datasets. To overcome this limitation, we developed FP-Zernike, a user-friendly toolkit for computing different types of Zernike descriptors based on feature points. Users simply need to enter a single line of command to calculate the Zernike descriptors of all structures in customized datasets. FP-Zernike outperforms the leading method in terms of retrieval accuracy and binary classification accuracy across diverse benchmark datasets. In addition, we showed the application of FP-Zernike in the construction of the descriptor database and the protocol used for the Protein Data Bank (PDB) dataset to facilitate the local deployment of this tool for interested readers. Our demonstration contained 590,685 structures, and at this scale, our system required only 4-9 s to complete a retrieval. The experiments confirmed that it achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy level. FP-Zernike is an open-source toolkit, with the source code and related data accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/BT007365/releases/0.1, as well as through a webserver at http://www.structbioinfo.cn/.",True,False,5.0,,fp-zernike,,16.9247425,ok,,structural database construction toolkit for fast structure retrieval,pdb,v2,0.9247425,FP-Zernike,True,5.0,True,True,https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/BT007365/releases/0.1 | http://www.structbioinfo.cn/,https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/BT007365/releases/0.1,True,"...th the source code and related data accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/biocode/tools/BT007365/releases/0.1, as well as through a webserver at http://www.str...",1
34935889,geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever: a bioinformatics tool to easily identify cancer prognostic datasets on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).,"<h4>Summary</h4>Having multiple datasets is a key aspect of robust bioinformatics analyses, because it allows researchers to find possible confirmation of the discoveries made on multiple cohorts. For this purpose, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) can be a useful database, since it provides hundreds of thousands of microarray gene expression datasets freely available for download and usage. Despite this large availability, collecting prognostic datasets of a specific cancer type from GEO can be a long, time-consuming and energy-consuming activity for any bioinformatician, who needs to execute it manually by first performing a search on the GEO website and then by checking all the datasets found one by one. To solve this problem, we present here geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever, a Perl 5 application which reads a cancer type and a list of microarray platforms, searches for prognostic gene expression datasets of that cancer type and based on those platforms available on GEO, and returns the GEO accession codes of those datasets, if found. Our bioinformatics tool can easily generate in a few minutes a list of cancer prognostic datasets that otherwise would require numerous hours of manual work to any bioinformatician. geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever can handily retrieve multiple prognostic datasets of gene expression of any cancer type, laying the foundations for numerous bioinformatics studies and meta-analyses that can have a strong impact on oncology research.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever is freely available under the GPLv2 license on the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at https://metacpan.org/pod/App::geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever and on GitHub at https://github.com/AbbasAlameer/geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.5,,eocancerprognosticdatasetsretriever,,16.9238925,ok,geo | gene expression omnibus,gene expression omnibus | geocancerprognosticdatasetsretriever,geo | eo,v2,0.9238925,geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever,False,0.0,False,False,https://metacpan.org/pod/App::geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever,https://metacpan.org/pod/App::geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever,True,...the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) at https://metacpan.org/pod/App::geoCancerPrognosticDatasetsRetriever and on GitHub at https://github.com/AbbasAlameer/...,1
38412834,Decomprolute is a benchmarking platform designed for multiomics-based tumor deconvolution.,"Tumor deconvolution enables the identification of diverse cell types that comprise solid tumors. To date, however, both the algorithms developed to deconvolve tumor samples, and the gold-standard datasets used to assess the algorithms are geared toward the analysis of gene expression (e.g., RNA sequencing) rather than protein levels. Despite the popularity of gene expression datasets, protein levels often provide a more accurate view of rare cell types. To facilitate the use, development, and reproducibility of multiomic deconvolution algorithms, we introduce Decomprolute, a Common Workflow Language framework that leverages containerization to compare tumor deconvolution algorithms across multiomic datasets. Decomprolute incorporates the large-scale multiomic datasets produced by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), which include matched mRNA expression and proteomic data from thousands of tumors across multiple cancer types to build a fully open-source, containerized proteogenomic tumor deconvolution benchmarking platform. http://pnnl-compbio.github.io/decomprolute.",True,False,3.0,,decomprolute,,16.92251146,ok,,,,v2,0.92251146,,False,0.0,False,False,http://pnnl-compbio.github.io/decomprolute,http://pnnl-compbio.github.io/decomprolute,True,...enomic tumor deconvolution benchmarking platform. http://pnnl-compbio.github.io/decomprolute.,1

38506570,Development of marine biodiversity database (BISMaL) to enable estimations past habitat conditions for marine life in the northwestern Pacific.,"Global activities involving the collection of marine biodiversity information have provided a large amount of biological observation records that cover various spatiotemporal areas. To predict biological responses or distribution changes in response to environmental changes by using these observation records, it is essential to analyze not only the current marine physicochemical environmental conditions but also the past conditions when the organisms were observed. We developed a new function to estimate the past marine environmental conditions for the observation records in our marine biodiversity database (Biological Information System for Marine Life: BISMaL) and examine whether the database can reliably estimate thermal habitats for both benthic and planktonic marine organisms. For the benthic squat lobster Shinkaia crosnieri, the estimated and observed in situ temperatures were similar to each other. For the planktonic chaetognaths Krohnitta pacifica and K. subtilis, the estimated temperatures showed clear seasonal changes specific to their distribution areas. These results indicated that BISMaL can reliably provide past habitat conditions regardless of planktonic or benthic lifestyles. BISMaL, which provides both biological observations and estimated past environmental conditions through web services, could lower the barrier to data access and use and make data-driven science available not only for data scientists but also for various marine scientists, such as taxonomists, ecologists and field scientists.

However, pathway and functional information for genes and metabolites are distributed among many siloed resources, limiting the scope of analyses that rely on a single knowledge source.<h4>Results</h4>RaMP-DB 2.0 is a web interface, relational database, API and R package designed for straightforward and comprehensive functional interpretation of metabolomic and multi-omic data. RaMP-DB 2.0 has been upgraded with an expanded breadth and depth of functional and chemical annotations (ClassyFire, LIPID MAPS, SMILES, InChIs, etc.), with new data types related to metabolites and lipids incorporated. To streamline entity resolution across multiple source databases, we have implemented a new semi-automated process, thereby lessening the burden of harmonization and supporting more frequent updates. The associated RaMP-DB 2.0 R package now supports queries on pathways, common reactions (e.g. metabolite-enzyme relationship), chemical functional ontologies, chemical classes and chemical structures, as well as enrichment analyses on pathways (multi-omic) and chemical classes. Lastly, the RaMP-DB web interface has been completely redesigned using the Angular framework.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code used to build all components of RaMP-DB 2.0 are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/ncats/ramp-db, https://github.com/ncats/RaMP-Client/ and https://github.com/ncats/RaMP-Backend.

40123802,BGMDB: A curated database linking gut microbiota dysbiosis to brain disorders.,"The gut microbiota is a fundamental component of human health and has been increasingly implicated in the etiology of neurological disorders. Neurotransmitters, acting as key mediators of gut-brain communication, are closely associated with both the progression and therapeutic modulation of brain diseases. Despite significant advancements in microbiome research, the complex interplay between gut microbiota and neurological disorders remains poorly understood, and a comprehensive resource integrating these associations is lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed the Brain Disease Gut Microbiota Database (BGMDB), a rigorously curated repository documenting experimentally validated relationships between gut microbiota and brain diseases. BGMDB encompasses 1419 associations involving 609 gut microbiota taxa and 43 brain disorders, along with 184 tripartite interactions linking brain diseases, neurotransmitters, and microbiota across six neurotransmitter systems. Additionally, BGMDB integrates genetic data from the gutMGene database, allowing users to explore microbiota-mediated genetic associations with brain disease pathology and neuroanatomical alterations. A user-friendly interface enables researchers to navigate relevant information through graphical query tools, comprehensive browsing functionalities, and data retrieval options.

39994572,MARSweb: a fully automated web service for set-based association testing.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite the successes in GWAS, there is still a large gap between the known heritability and the part explained by the SNPs identified by GWAS. Set-based analysis is one of the approaches that has tried to identify associations between multiple variants in a locus a trait, leveraging allelic heterogeneity to increase power in association testing. MARS is a set-based analysis method that integrates likelihood ratio test with a recently developed fine mapping technique to accurately account for causal status of variants in a risk locus. Unfortunately, due to its complex running process, time complexity, and the requirement of high-performance computing resources, it is not widely used.<h4>Results</h4>To address these issues, we proposed a fully automated web-based analysis service, MARSweb. By providing a web service, we minimized the effort required for initial configuration. Additionally, users can perform analyses by simply uploading their data without needing to familiarize themselves with intricate analysis procedures. Furthermore, it facilitates easier interpretation of results by integrating advanced visualization tools. We confirmed the performance of MARSweb by detecting eGenes and performing pathway analysis of the genes using a Yeast Dataset.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MARSweb is a web-based analysis service that fully automates set-based analysis. It offers an intuitive user interface, making complex analyses more accessible while significantly reducing processing time for enhanced efficiency.

38653491,CovEpiAb: a comprehensive database and analysis resource for immune epitopes and antibodies of human coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses have threatened humans repeatedly, especially COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has posed a substantial threat to global public health. SARS-CoV-2 continuously evolves through random mutation, resulting in a significant decrease in the efficacy of existing vaccines and neutralizing antibody drugs. It is critical to assess immune escape caused by viral mutations and develop broad-spectrum vaccines and neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes. Thus, we constructed CovEpiAb, a comprehensive database and analysis resource of human coronavirus (HCoVs) immune epitopes and antibodies. CovEpiAb contains information on over 60 000 experimentally validated epitopes and over 12 000 antibodies for HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The database is unique in (1) classifying and annotating cross-reactive epitopes from different viruses and variants; (2) providing molecular and experimental interaction profiles of antibodies, including structure-based binding sites and around 70 000 data on binding affinity and neutralizing activity; (3) providing virological characteristics of current and past circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and in vitro activity of various therapeutics; and (4) offering site-level annotations of key functional features, including antibody binding, immunological epitopes, SARS-CoV-2 mutations and conservation across HCoVs.

35643191,dbDEMC 3.0: Functional Exploration of Differentially Expressed miRNAs in Cancers of Human and Model Organisms.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators in gene expression. The dysregulation of miRNA expression is widely reported in the transformation from physiological to pathological states of cells. A large number of differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) have been identified in various human cancers by using high-throughput technologies, such as microarray and miRNA-seq. Through mining of published studies with high-throughput experiment information, the database of DEMs in human cancers (dbDEMC) was constructed with the aim of providing a systematic resource for the storage and query of the DEMs. Here we report an update of the dbDEMC to version 3.0, which contains two-fold more data entries than the second version and now includes also data from mice and rats. The dbDEMC 3.0 contains 3268 unique DEMs in 40 different cancer types. The current datasets for differential expression analysis have expanded to 9 generalized categories. Moreover, the current release integrates functional annotations of DEMs obtained by using experimentally validated targets. The annotations can be of great benefit to the intensive analysis of the roles of DEMs in cancer.

The Spatial Omics Database (SODB) was established to offer a unified format for data storage and interactive visualization modules. Here we detail the use of Pysodb, a Python-based tool designed to enable the efficient exploration and loading of spatial datasets from SODB within a Python environment. We present seven case studies using Pysodb, detailing the interaction with various computational methods, ensuring reproducibility of experimental data and facilitating the integration of new data and alternative applications in SODB. The approach offers a reference for method developers by outlining label and metadata availability in representative spatial data that can be loaded by Pysodb.

However, the complex ingredients of TCM and their interactions with the human body make elucidating molecular mechanisms challenging, which greatly hinders the modernization of TCM. In 2016, we developed BATMAN-TCM 1.0, which is an integrated database of TCM ingredient-target protein interaction (TTI) for pharmacology research. Here, to address the growing need for a higher coverage TTI dataset, and using omics data to screen active TCM ingredients or herbs for complex disease treatment, we updated BATMAN-TCM to version 2.0 (http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/batman-tcm/). Using the same protocol as version 1.0, we collected 17 068 known TTIs by manual curation (with a 62.3-fold increase), and predicted ∼2.3 million high-confidence TTIs. In addition, we incorporated three new features into the updated version: (i) it enables simultaneous exploration of the target of TCM ingredient for pharmacology research and TCM ingredients binding to target proteins for drug discovery; (ii) it has significantly expanded TTI coverage; and (iii) the website was redesigned for better user experience and higher speed.

36300631,PROTAC-DB 2.0: an updated database of PROTACs.,"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which harness the ubiquitin-proteasome system to selectively induce targeted protein degradation, represent an emerging therapeutic technology with the potential to modulate traditional undruggable targets. Over the past few years, this technology has moved from academia to industry and more than 10 PROTACs have been advanced into clinical trials. However, designing potent PROTACs with desirable drug-like properties still remains a great challenge. Here, we report an updated online database, PROTAC-DB 2.0, which is a repository of structural and experimental data about PROTACs. In this 2nd release, we expanded the number of PROTACs to 3270, which corresponds to a 96% expansion over the first version. Meanwhile, the numbers of warheads (small molecules targeting the proteins of interest), linkers, and E3 ligands (small molecules recruiting E3 ligases) have increased to over 360, 1500 and 80, respectively. In addition, given the importance and the limited number of the crystal target-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex structures, we provide the predicted ternary complex structures for PROTACs with good degradation capability using our PROTAC-Model method.

35950764,The HPV Induced Cancer Resource (THInCR): a Suite of Tools for Investigating HPV-Dependent Human Carcinogenesis.,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are highly infectious and cause the most common sexually transmitted viral infections. They induce hyperproliferation of squamous epithelial tissue, often forming warts. Virally encoded proteins reprogram gene expression and cell growth to create an optimal environment for viral replication. In addition to their normal roles in infection, functional alterations induced by viral proteins establish conditions that frequently contribute to human carcinogenesis. In fact, ~5% of human cancers are caused by HPVs, with virtually all cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CESC) and an increasing number of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSC) attributed to HPV infection. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecularly characterized thousands of primary human cancer samples in many cancer types, including CESC and HNSC, and created a comprehensive atlas of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data. This publicly available genome-wide information provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the knowledge of the role that HPV plays in human carcinogenesis. While many tools exist to mine these data, few, if any, focus on the comparison of HPV-positive cancers with their HPV-negative counterparts or adjacent normal control tissue. We have constructed a suite of web-based tools, The HPV Induced Cancer Resource (THInCR), to utilize TCGA data for research related to HPV-induced CESC and HNSC. These tools allow investigators to gain greater biological and medical insights by exploring the impacts of HPV on cellular gene expression (mRNA and microRNA), altered gene methylation, and associations with patient survival and immune landscape features. These tools are accessible at https://thincr.ca/. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The suite of analytical tools of THInCR provides the opportunity to investigate the roles that candidate target genes identified in cell lines or other model systems contribute to in actual HPV-dependent human cancers and is based on large-scale TCGA data sets. Expression of target genes, including both mRNA and microRNA, can be correlated with HPV gene expression, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation, patient survival, and numerous immune features, like leukocyte infiltration, interferon gamma response, T cell response, etc. Data from these analyses may immediately provide evidence to validate <i>in vitro</i> observations, reveal insights into mechanisms of virus-mediated alterations in cell growth, behavior, gene expression, and innate and adaptive immunity and may help hypothesis generation for further investigations.",True,False,3.0,,hpv induced cancer resource,,16.900201199999998,ok,tcga | the cancer genome atlas,the hpv induced cancer resource | the cancer genome atlas,thincr | cesc | tcga,v2,0.9002012,HPV Induced Cancer Resource,True,3.0,True,True,https://thincr.ca/,https://thincr.ca/,True,...landscape features.

Advances in instrumentation and data acquisition modes, such as the recently developed real-time database search (RTS), can reduce interference. However, interference persists as does the need to benchmark upstream sample preparation and data acquisition strategies. Here, we present an updated Triple yeast KnockOut (TKO) standard as well as corresponding upgrades to the TKO viewing tool (TVT2.5, http://tko.hms.harvard.edu/). Specifically, we expand the TKO standard to incorporate the TMTpro18-plex reagents (TKO18). We also construct a variant thereof which has been digested only with LysC (TKO18L). We compare proteome coverage and interference levels of TKO18 and TKO18L data that are acquired under different data acquisition modes and analyzed using TVT2.5. Our data illustrate that RTS reduces interference while improving proteome coverage and suggest that digesting with LysC alone only modestly reduces interference, albeit at the expense of proteome depth.

36271888,"EV-ADD, a database for EV-associated DNA in human liquid biopsy samples.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cellular communication both in physiological conditions and in pathologies such as cancer. Emerging evidence has shown that EVs are active carriers of molecular cargo (e.g. protein and nucleic acids) and a powerful source of biomarkers and targets. While recent studies on EV-associated DNA (EV-DNA) in human biofluids have generated a large amount of data, there is currently no database that catalogues information on EV-DNA. To fill this gap, we have manually curated a database of EV-DNA data derived from human biofluids (liquid biopsy) and in-vitro studies, called the Extracellular Vesicle-Associated DNA Database (EV-ADD). This database contains validated experimental details and data extracted from peer-reviewed published literature. It can be easily queried to search for EV isolation methods and characterization, EV-DNA isolation techniques, quality validation, DNA fragment size, volume of starting material, gene names and disease context. Currently, our database contains samples representing 23 diseases, with 13 different types of EV isolation techniques applied on eight different human biofluids (e.g. blood, saliva). In addition, EV-ADD encompasses EV-DNA data both representing the whole genome and specifically including oncogenes, such as KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, MYC, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). An EV-ADD data metric system was also integrated to assign a compliancy score to the MISEV guidelines based on experimental parameters reported in each study. While currently available databases document the presence of proteins, lipids, RNA and metabolites in EVs (e.g. Vesiclepedia, ExoCarta, ExoBCD, EVpedia, and EV-TRACK), to the best of our knowledge, EV-ADD is the first of its kind to compile all available EV-DNA datasets derived from human biofluid samples. We believe that this database provides an important reference resource on EV-DNA-based liquid biopsy research, serving as a learning tool and to showcase the latest developments in the EV-DNA field.

36525367,NcPath: a novel platform for visualization and enrichment analysis of human non-coding RNA and KEGG signaling pathways.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Non-coding RNAs play important roles in transcriptional processes and participate in the regulation of various biological functions, in particular miRNAs and lncRNAs. Despite their importance for several biological functions, the existing signaling pathway databases do not include information on miRNA and lncRNA. Here, we redesigned a novel pathway database named NcPath by integrating and visualizing a total of 178 308 human experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions (MTIs), 32 282 experimentally verified lncRNA-target interactions (LTIs) and 4837 experimentally validated human ceRNA networks across 222 KEGG pathways (including 27 sub-categories). To expand the application potential of the redesigned NcPath database, we identified 556 798 reliable lncRNA-protein-coding genes (PCG) interaction pairs by integrating co-expression relations, ceRNA relations, co-TF-binding interactions, co-histone-modification interactions, cis-regulation relations and lncPro Tool predictions between lncRNAs and PCG. In addition, to determine the pathways in which miRNA/lncRNA targets are involved, we performed a KEGG enrichment analysis using a hypergeometric test. The NcPath database also provides information on MTIs/LTIs/ceRNA networks, PubMed IDs, gene annotations and the experimental verification method used. In summary, the NcPath database will serve as an important and continually updated platform that provides annotation and visualization of the pathways on which non-coding RNAs (miRNA and lncRNA) are involved, and provide support to multimodal non-coding RNAs enrichment analysis.

37855663,Ribocentre-switch: a database of riboswitches.,"Riboswitches are regulatory elements found in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain mRNA molecules. They typically comprise two distinct domains: an aptamer domain that can bind to specific small molecules, and an expression platform that controls gene expression. Riboswitches work by undergoing a conformational change upon binding to their specific ligand, thus activating or repressing the genes downstream. This mechanism allows gene expression regulation in response to metabolites or small molecules. To systematically summarise riboswitch structures and their related ligand binding functions, we present Ribocentre-switch, a comprehensive database of riboswitches, including the information as follows: sequences, structures, functions, ligand binding pockets and biological applications. It encompasses 56 riboswitches and 26 orphan riboswitches from over 430 references, with a total of 89 591 sequences.

The top-level ortholog table is now constructed from 1,812 genus-level pan-genomes, 6,268 species-level pan-genomes, and 34,079 genomes in total. To support analyses of newly sequenced genomes, MBGD updates MyMBGD functionality, which offers two analysis modes: assignment mode and clustering mode. Assignment mode rapidly classifies genes in the query genomes into existing MBGD ortholog groups, while clustering mode performs de novo clustering of query genomes using the DomClust program. In assignment mode, users can evaluate the presence of genomic functions, as defined in the KEGG Module database, in each query genome using the Genomaple software and compare the results across multiple genomes. To enhance this analysis, we developed a method to subdivide MBGD ortholog groups as needed to improve cross-references to the KEGG Orthology groups. Another notable feature is the phylogenetic profile search interface, which enables users to specify a set of organisms in which orthologs are present or absent (i.e., a phylogenetic profile), and search for ortholog groups with similar phylogenetic profiles. To construct a phylogenetic profile, users can search organisms by specifying phenotype, environment, taxonomy, or a particular ortholog group.

In this second version, the annotation was implemented to 51 photosynthetic species covering the whole phylogenetic tree of photosynthetic organisms, from the most basal group of Archeplastida, the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa, to various land plants. tRNA genes from lower photosynthetic organisms such as streptophyte algae or lycophytes as well as extremophile photosynthetic species such as Eutrema parvulum were incorporated in the database. As a whole, about 37 000 tRNA genes were accurately annotated. In the frame of the tRNA genes annotation from the genome of the Rhodophyte Chondrus crispus, non-canonical splicing sites in the D- or T-regions of tRNA molecules were identified and experimentally validated.

37106367,PlaASDB: a comprehensive database of plant alternative splicing events in response to stress.,"<h4>Background</h4>Alternative splicing (AS) is a co-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of plants in response to environmental stress. However, the role of AS in biotic and abiotic stress responses remains largely unknown. To speed up our understanding of plant AS patterns under different stress responses, development of informative and comprehensive plant AS databases is highly demanded.<h4>Description</h4>In this study, we first collected 3,255 RNA-seq data under biotic and abiotic stresses from two important model plants (Arabidopsis and rice). Then, we conducted AS event detection and gene expression analysis, and established a user-friendly plant AS database termed PlaASDB. By using representative samples from this highly integrated database resource, we compared AS patterns between Arabidopsis and rice under abiotic and biotic stresses, and further investigated the corresponding difference between AS and gene expression. Specifically, we found that differentially spliced genes (DSGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEG) share very limited overlapping under all kinds of stresses, suggesting that gene expression regulation and AS seemed to play independent roles in response to stresses. Compared with gene expression, Arabidopsis and rice were more inclined to have conserved AS patterns under stress conditions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PlaASDB is a comprehensive plant-specific AS database that mainly integrates the AS and gene expression data of Arabidopsis and rice in stress response. Through large-scale comparative analyses, the global landscape of AS events in Arabidopsis and rice was observed. We believe that PlaASDB could help researchers understand the regulatory mechanisms of AS in plants under stresses more conveniently.

40293718,PICRUSt2-SC: an update to the reference database used for functional prediction within PICRUSt2.,"<h4>Summary</h4>PICRUSt2 is a bioinformatic tool that predicts microbial functions in amplicon sequencing data using a database of annotated reference genomes. We have constructed an updated database for PICRUSt2 that has substantially increased the number of bacterial (19,493 to 26,868) and archaeal (406 to 1,002) genomes as well as the number of functional annotations present. The previous PICRUSt2 database relied on many timely and computationally intensive manual processes that made it difficult to update. We constructed a new streamlined process to allow regular upgrades to the PICRUSt2 database on an ongoing basis, and used this process to create a new database, PICRUSt2-SC (Sugar-Coated). Additionally, we have shown that this updated database contains genomes that more closely match study sequences from a range of different environments. The genomes contained in the database therefore better represent these environments and this leads to an improvement in the predicted functional annotations obtained from PICRUSt2.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PICRUSt2 source code is freely available at https://github.com/picrust/picrust2 and at https://anaconda.org/bioconda/picrust2.

35799352,HARIBOSS: a curated database of RNA-small molecules structures to aid rational drug design.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA molecules are implicated in numerous fundamental biological processes and many human pathologies, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, muscular diseases and bacterial infections. Modulating the mode of action of disease-implicated RNA molecules can lead to the discovery of new therapeutical agents and even address pathologies linked to 'undruggable' protein targets. This modulation can be achieved by direct targeting of RNA with small molecules. As of today, only a few RNA-targeting small molecules are used clinically. One of the main obstacles that have hampered the development of a rational drug design protocol to target RNA with small molecules is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of RNA-small molecule (RNA-SM) recognition.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Harnessing RIBOnucleic acid-Small molecule Structures (HARIBOSS), a curated collection of RNA-SM structures determined by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy.

39924294,AtSubP-2.0: An integrated web server for the annotation of Arabidopsis proteome subcellular localization using deep learning.,"The organization of subcellular components in a cell is critical for its function and studying cellular processes, protein-protein interactions, identifying potential drug targets, network analysis, and other systems biology mechanisms. Determining protein localization experimentally is time-consuming and expensive. Due to the need for meticulous experimentation, validation, and data analysis, computational methods provide a quick and accurate alternative. Arabidopsis thaliana, a beneficial model organism in plant biology, facilitates experimentation and applies to other plants. Predicting its proteins' subcellular localization can improve our understanding of cellular processes and have applications in crop improvement and biotechnology. We propose AtSubP-2.0, an extension of our previously developed and widely used AtSubP v1.0 tool for annotating the Arabidopsis proteome. For precise protein subcellular localization prediction, AtSubP-2.0 employs a four-phase strategy. The first phase differentiates between single and dual localization with accuracy (97.66% in fivefold training/testing, 98.10% on independent data) and high Matthews correlation coefficient (0.88 training, 0.90 independent). Single localized proteins are classified into 12 locations at the second phase, with accuracy (98.37% in fivefold training/testing, 97.43% on independent data) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.94 training, 0.91 independent). The third phase categorizes dual location proteins into nine classes with accuracy (99.65% in fivefold training/testing, 98.16% on independent data) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.92 training, 0.87 independent). We also employed a fourth phase that classifies the membrane type proteins predicted in phase I into single-pass and multi-pass membrane with accuracy (98% in fivefold training/testing, 98.55% on independent data) and a high Matthews correlation coefficient (0.95 training, 0.97 independent).

37329484,DSP: database of disease susceptibility genes in plants.,"Host-pathogen interaction is the most crucial factor that evokes the host immune system to fight against pathogens. In contrast to specialized immune cells present in humans and animals, plants have disease resistance (R-) and disease susceptibility (S-) genes. R-genes confer disease resistance and are generally introgressed from wild crop relatives to cultivated crops. S-genes, on the other hand, assist pathogens in establishing contact, displaying counter-defense measures, and spreading the infection. To achieve resistance in a variety of crops, researchers are now focusing on the identification, silencing, editing, or elimination of crucial S-genes. To aid in this field, we created the first curated database of disease susceptibility genes in plants (DSP), with the simple and advanced search tool that allows researchers to restrict the query and mining of specified hits. SSR marker identification and primer designing could be performed with the help of MISA and Primer3 software, respectively.

37620754,GMMAD: a comprehensive database of human gut microbial metabolite associations with diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>The natural products, metabolites, of gut microbes are crucial effect factors on diseases. Comprehensive identification and annotation of relationships among disease, metabolites, and microbes can provide efficient and targeted solutions towards understanding the mechanism of complex disease and development of new markers and drugs.<h4>Results</h4>We developed Gut Microbial Metabolite Association with Disease (GMMAD), a manually curated database of associations among human diseases, gut microbes, and metabolites of gut microbes. Here, this initial release (i) contains 3,836 disease-microbe associations and 879,263 microbe-metabolite associations, which were extracted from literatures and available resources and then experienced our manual curation; (ii) defines an association strength score and a confidence score. With these two scores, GMMAD predicted 220,690 disease-metabolite associations, where the metabolites all belong to the gut microbes. We think that the positive effective (with both scores higher than suggested thresholds) associations will help identify disease marker and understand the pathogenic mechanism from the sense of gut microbes. The negative effective associations would be taken as biomarkers and have the potential as drug candidates. Literature proofs supported our proposal with experimental consistence; (iii) provides a user-friendly web interface that allows users to browse, search, and download information on associations among diseases, metabolites, and microbes.

When enzymatic reactions are disrupted by gene, protein, or metabolite dysfunctions in diseases, it becomes crucial to visualize the resulting perturbed enzymatic reaction-induced multi-omics network. Multi-omics network visualization aids in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the functionality and regulatory mechanisms within biological systems.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we designed PhenoMultiOmics, an enzymatic reaction-based multi-omics web server designed to explore the scope of the multi-omics network across various cancer types.

39237879,Cortexa: a comprehensive resource for studying gene expression and alternative splicing in the murine brain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene expression and alternative splicing are strictly regulated processes that shape brain development and determine the cellular identity of differentiated neural cell populations. Despite the availability of multiple valuable datasets, many functional implications, especially those related to alternative splicing, remain poorly understood. Moreover, neuroscientists working primarily experimentally often lack the bioinformatics expertise required to process alternative splicing data and produce meaningful and interpretable results. Notably, re-analyzing publicly available datasets and integrating them with in-house data can provide substantial novel insights. However, such analyses necessitate developing harmonized data handling and processing pipelines which in turn require considerable computational resources and in-depth bioinformatics expertise.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Cortexa-a comprehensive web portal that incorporates RNA-sequencing datasets from the mouse cerebral cortex (longitudinal or cell-specific) and the hippocampus. Cortexa facilitates understandable visualization of the expression and alternative splicing patterns of individual genes. Our platform provides SplicePCA-a tool that allows users to integrate their alternative splicing dataset and compare it to cell-specific or developmental neocortical splicing patterns. All standardized gene expression and alternative splicing datasets can be downloaded for further in-depth downstream analysis without the need for extensive preprocessing.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Cortexa provides a robust and readily available resource for unraveling the complexity of gene expression and alternative splicing regulatory processes in the mouse brain.

Numerous factors, including lifestyle, diet, and physical fitness, are known to shape the composition of the human microbiome. However, a significant challenge in elucidating the relationships between these factors and the gut microbiome lies in needing a comprehensive database that integrates diverse human microbiome profiles with extensive sample metadata. To address this issue, we developed an extensive human microbiome database for healthy individuals. This initiative led to the establishment of the NIBN Japan Microbiome Database (NIBN JMD), one of the largest resources of its kind, encompassing up to 1,000 metadata points and more than 2,000 microbiome samples, including data from longitudinal studies.

EchinoDB is a database of genomic and transcriptomic data on echinoderms. The initial database consisted of groups of 749,397 orthologous and paralogous transcripts arranged in orthoclusters by sequence similarity.<h4>Results</h4>The updated version of EchinoDB includes two new major datasets: the RNA-Seq data of the brittle star Ophioderma brevispinum and the high-quality genomic assembly data of the green sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. In addition, we enabled keyword searches for annotated data and installed an updated version of Sequenceserver to allow Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches. The data are downloadable in FASTA format. The first version of EchinoDB appeared in 2016 and was implemented in GO on a local server. The new version has been updated using R Shiny to include new features and improvements in the application. Furthermore, EchinoDB now runs entirely in the cloud for increased reliability and scaling.<h4>Conclusion</h4>EchinoDB serves a user base drawn from the fields of phylogenetics, developmental biology, genomics, physiology, neurobiology, and regeneration. As use cases, we illustrate the function of EchinoDB in retrieving components of signaling pathways involved in the tissue regeneration process of different echinoderms, including the emerging model species Ophioderma brevispinum. Moreover, we use EchinoDB to shed light on the conservation of the molecular components involved in two echinoderm-specific phenomena: spicule matrix proteins involved in the formation of stereom endoskeleton and the tensilin protein that contributes to the capacity of the connective tissues to quickly change its mechanical properties. The genes involved in the former had been previously studied in echinoids, while gene sequences involved in the latter had been previously described in holothuroids. Specifically, we ask (a) if the biomineralization-related proteins previously reported only in sea urchins are also present in other, non-echinoid, echinoderms and (b) if tensilin, the protein responsible for the control of stiffness of the mutable collagenous tissue, previously described in sea cucumbers, is conserved across the phylum.",False,True,,0.71924114,chinodb,,16.8592423,ok,,echinodb,,v2,0.8592423,EchinoDB,True,1.0,False,False,https://echinodb.uncc.edu,https://echinodb.uncc.edu,True,"...elease a new version of EchinoDB, EchinoDB v2.0 ( https://echinodb.uncc.edu ).

40504102,Pra-GE-ATLAS: Empowering Pinus radiata stress and breeding research through a multi-omics database.,"In recent decades, research on model organisms has significantly increased our understanding of core biological processes in plant science. However, this focus has created a substantial knowledge bottleneck due to the limited phylogenetic and ecological spectrum covered. Gymnosperms, especially conifers, represent a molecular and ecological diversity hotspot among seed plants. Despite their importance, research on these species is notably underrepresented, primarily due to a slower pace of investigation resulting from a lack of community-based resources and databases. To fill this gap, we developed the P(inus)ra(diata)-G(ene)E(xpression) (Pra-GE)-ATLAS, which consists of several tools and two main modules: transcriptomics and proteomics, presented in this work for the forestry commercial and stress-sensitive species Pinus radiata. We have summarized and centralized all the available information to provide a comprehensive view of the gene expression landscape. To illustrate how applications of the database lead to new biological insights, we have integrated multiple regulatory layers across tissues and stressors. While stress favors the retention of small introns, harmonized alternative splicing analyses reveal that genes with conifers' iconic large introns tend to be under constitutive regulation. Furthermore, the degree of convergence between stressors differed between regulatory layers, with proteomic responses remaining highly distinctive even through intergenerational memory tolerance. Overall, the Pra-GE-ATLAS aims to narrow the distance between angiosperms and gymnosperms resources, deepening our understanding of how characteristic pine features have evolved.

38835776,MONET: a database for prediction of neoantigens derived from microsatellite loci.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microsatellite instability (MSI) secondary to mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is characterized by insertions and deletions (indels) in short DNA sequences across the genome. These indels can generate neoantigens, which are ideal targets for precision immune interception. However, current neoantigen databases lack information on neoantigens arising from coding microsatellites. To address this gap, we introduce The MicrOsatellite Neoantigen Discovery Tool (MONET).<h4>Method</h4>MONET identifies potential mutated tumor-specific neoantigens (neoAgs) by predicting frameshift mutations in coding microsatellite sequences of the human genome.

40133792,"Heligeom: A web resource to generate, analyze, and visualize filament architectures based on pairwise association geometries of biological macromolecules.","At the subcellular level, macromolecules self-assemble to form molecular machinery in which the assembly modes play critical roles: the structural integrity of cell walls that allows mechanical growth, the maintenance and repair of the genetic material, membrane flow control, protein chaperoning, and ATP production, to cite just a few examples. As molecular modeling expands its scope to such systems, structural biologists are faced with the difficulty of understanding the structure and dynamics of these supramolecular assemblies. We present Heligeom, a webserver that offers a simple and efficient means for analyzing and constructing oligomeric assemblies based on user-provided structures of two interacting units. The input 3D coordinates may result from structure determination, simulations, docking trials, or deep-learning tools such as AlphaFold. For a given interface, Heligeom outputs the mathematical helical parameters of the corresponding oligomeric form, including axis, pitch, handedness, number of monomers per turn, etc. The server also allows leveraging these parameters to construct oligomers of specified size, visualizing them interactively, and downloading them as PDB files. For subunits (protomers) having multiple interaction geometries, the different interfaces and their global assembly geometry can be visualized and compared. Heligeom thus allows explicitly linking protomer-protomer interfaces to the oligomeric architecture, illuminating possible sources of plasticity in protein filaments such as mutations or thermal, mechanical, or chemical perturbations. Heligeom thus constitutes an intuitive tool to accompany integrative modeling of oligomeric filamentous assemblies. Examples of its application at different structural levels are presented.

A common goal of these studies is to identify microbial species or genes that contribute to differences in metabolite levels across samples. Previous work indicated that integrating these datasets with reference knowledge on microbial metabolic capacities may enable more precise and confident inference of microbe-metabolite links.<h4>Results</h4>We present MIMOSA2, an R package and web application for model-based integrative analysis of microbiome-metabolome datasets. MIMOSA2 uses genomic and metabolic reference databases to construct a community metabolic model based on microbiome data and uses this model to predict differences in metabolite levels across samples. These predictions are compared with metabolomics data to identify putative microbiome-governed metabolites and taxonomic contributors to metabolite variation.

38312948,HIVseqDB: a portable resource for NGS and sample metadata integration for HIV-1 drug resistance analysis.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a public health threat, with drug resistance being a major concern in HIV treatment. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for identifying low-abundance drug resistance mutations (LA-DRMs) that conventional Sanger sequencing cannot reliably detect. To fully understand the significance of LA-DRMs, it is necessary to integrate NGS data with clinical and demographic data. However, freely available tools for NGS-based HIV-1 drug resistance analysis do not integrate these data. This poses a challenge in interpretation of the impact of LA-DRMs, mainly for resource-limited settings due to the shortage of bioinformatics expertise. To address this challenge, we present HIVseqDB, a portable, secure, and user-friendly resource for integrating NGS data with associated clinical and demographic data for analysis of HIV drug resistance. HIVseqDB currently supports uploading of NGS data and associated sample data, HIV-1 drug resistance data analysis, browsing of uploaded data, and browsing and visualizing of analysis results. Each function of HIVseqDB corresponds to an individual Django application. This ensures efficient incorporation of additional features with minimal effort. HIVseqDB can be deployed on various computing environments, such as on-premises high-performance computing facilities and cloud-based platforms.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>HIVseqDB is available at https://github.com/AlfredUg/HIVseqDB.

38109500,Drying without dying: A genome database for desiccation-tolerant plants and evolution of desiccation tolerance.,"Desiccation is typically fatal, but a small number of land plants have evolved vegetative desiccation tolerance (VDT), allowing them to dry without dying through a process called anhydrobiosis. Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the investigation of genomes for desiccation-tolerant plants over the past decade. However, a dedicated and integrated database for these valuable genomic resources has been lacking. Our prolonged interest in VDT plant genomes motivated us to create the ""Drying without Dying"" database, which contains a total of 16 VDT-related plant genomes (including 10 mosses) and incorporates 10 genomes that are closely related to VDT plants. The database features bioinformatic tools, such as blast and homologous cluster search, sequence retrieval, Gene Ontology term and metabolic pathway enrichment statistics, expression profiling, co-expression network extraction, and JBrowser exploration for each genome. To demonstrate its utility, we conducted tailored PFAM family statistical analyses, and we discovered that the drought-responsive ABA transporter AWPM-19 family is significantly tandemly duplicated in all bryophytes but rarely so in tracheophytes. Transcriptomic investigations also revealed that response patterns following desiccation diverged between bryophytes and angiosperms. Combined, the analyses provided genomic and transcriptomic evidence supporting a possible divergence and lineage-specific evolution of VDT in plants.

35762265,metaPR<sup>2</sup> : A database of eukaryotic 18S rRNA metabarcodes with an emphasis on protists.,"In recent years, metabarcoding has become the method of choice for investigating the composition and assembly of microbial eukaryotic communities. The number of environmental data sets published has increased very rapidly. Although unprocessed sequence files are often publicly available, processed data, in particular clustered sequences, are rarely available in a usable format. Clustered sequences are reported as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with different similarity levels or more recently as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). This hampers comparative studies between different environments and data sets, for example examining the biogeographical patterns of specific groups/species, as well analysing the genetic microdiversity within these groups. Here, we present a newly-assembled database of processed 18S rRNA metabarcodes that are annotated with the PR<sup>2</sup> reference sequence database.

Since regenerative capacity declines with age, promoting regeneration is heralded as a potential strategy for delaying aging. On this premise, mechanisms that regulate regeneration have been extensively studied across species and in different tissues. However, an open and comprehensive database collecting and standardizing the abundant data generated in regeneration research, such as high-throughput sequencing data, remains to be developed. In this work, we constructed Regeneration Roadmap to systematically and comprehensively collect such information over 2.38 million data entries across 11 species and 36 tissues, including regeneration-related genes, bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, and pharmacogenomics data.

The Portal displays the data in multiple tools (PDX Finder, cBioPortal, and GenomeCruzer in future), which are populated from a common database displaying strictly mutually consistent views.<h4>(short) conclusion</h4>EurOPDX Data Portal is an entry point to the EurOPDX Research Infrastructure offering PDX mice models for collaborative research, (meta)data describing their features and deep molecular data analysis according to users' interests.",True,False,4.5,,,uropdx,16.81687737,ok,,europdx | cbioportal,,v2,0.81687737,EurOPDX Data Portal,True,5.0,False,False,https://dataportal.europdx.eu/,https://dataportal.europdx.eu/,True,"...be the main features of the EurOPDX Data Portal ( https://dataportal.europdx.eu/ ), its architecture and possible utilization by r...",1
37889037,SLKB: synthetic lethality knowledge base.,"Emerging CRISPR-Cas9 technology permits synthetic lethality (SL) screening of large number of gene pairs from gene combination double knockout (CDKO) experiments. However, the poor integration and annotation of CDKO SL data in current SL databases limit their utility, and diverse methods of calculating SL scores prohibit their comparison. To overcome these shortcomings, we have developed SL knowledge base (SLKB) that incorporates data of 11 CDKO experiments in 22 cell lines, 16,059 SL gene pairs and 264,424 non-SL gene pairs. Additionally, within SLKB, we have implemented five SL calculation methods: median score with and without background control normalization (Median-B/NB), sgRNA-derived score (sgRNA-B/NB), Horlbeck score, GEMINI score and MAGeCK score. The five scores have demonstrated a mere 1.21% overlap among their top 10% SL gene pairs, reflecting high diversity. Users can browse SL networks and assess the impact of scoring methods using Venn diagrams. The SL network generated from all data in SLKB shows a greater likelihood of SL gene pair connectivity with other SL gene pairs than non-SL pairs.

39101783,Deciphering cancer genomes with GenomeSpy: a grammar-based visualization toolkit.,"<h4>Background</h4>Visualization is an indispensable facet of genomic data analysis. Despite the abundance of specialized visualization tools, there remains a distinct need for tailored solutions. However, their implementation typically requires extensive programming expertise from bioinformaticians and software developers, especially when building interactive applications. Toolkits based on visualization grammars offer a more accessible, declarative way to author new visualizations. Yet, current grammar-based solutions fall short in adequately supporting the interactive analysis of large datasets with extensive sample collections, a pivotal task often encountered in cancer research.<h4>Findings</h4>We present GenomeSpy, a grammar-based toolkit for authoring tailored, interactive visualizations for genomic data analysis. By using combinatorial building blocks and a declarative language, users can implement new visualization designs easily and embed them in web pages or end-user-oriented applications. A distinctive element of GenomeSpy's architecture is its effective use of the graphics processing unit in all rendering, enabling a high frame rate and smoothly animated interactions, such as navigation within a genome. We demonstrate the utility of GenomeSpy by characterizing the genomic landscape of 753 ovarian cancer samples from patients in the DECIDER clinical trial. Our results expand the understanding of the genomic architecture in ovarian cancer, particularly the diversity of chromosomal instability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GenomeSpy is a visualization toolkit applicable to a wide range of tasks pertinent to genome analysis.

39827990,ExerGeneDB: A physical exercise-regulated differential gene expression database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Exercise induces molecular changes that involve multiple organs and tissues. Moreover, these changes are modulated by various exercise parameters-such as intensity, frequency, mode, and duration-as well as by clinical features like gender, age, and body mass index (BMI), each eliciting distinct biological effects. To assist exercise researchers in understanding these changes from a comprehensive perspective that includes multiple organs, diverse exercise regimens, and a range of clinical features, we developed Exercise Regulated Genes Database (ExerGeneDB), a database of exercise-regulated differential genes.<h4>Methods</h4>ExerGeneDB aggregated publicly available exercise-related sequencing datasets and subjected them to uniform quality control and preprocessing. The data, encompassing a variety of types, were organized into a specialized database of exercise-regulated genes. Notably, ExerGeneDB conducted differential analyses on this collected data, leveraging curated clinical information and accounting for important factors such as gender, age, and BMI.<h4>Results</h4>ExerGeneDB has assembled 1692 samples from rats and mice as well as 4492 human samples.

39395186,ELiAH: the atlas of E3 ligases in human tissues for targeted protein degradation with reduced off-target effect.,"The development of therapeutic agents has mainly focused on designing small molecules to modulate target proteins or genes which are conventionally druggable. Therefore, targeted protein degradation (TPD) for undruggable cases has emerged as promising pharmaceutical approach. TPD, often referred PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras), uses a linker to degrade target proteins by hijacking the ubiquitination system. Therefore, unravel the relationship including reversal and co-expression between E3 ligands and other possible target genes in various human tissues is essential to mitigate off-target effects of TPD. Here, we developed the atlas of E3 ligases in human tissues (ELiAH), to prioritize E3 ligase-target gene pairs for TPD. Leveraging over 2900 of RNA-seq profiles consisting of 11 human tissues from the GTEx (genotype-tissue expression) consortium, users of ELiAH can identify tissue-specific genes and E3 ligases (FDR P-value of Mann-Whitney test < .05). ELiAH unravels 933 830 relationships consisting of 614 E3 ligases and 20 924 of expressed genes considering degree of tissue specificity, which are indispensable for ubiquitination based TPD development. In addition, docking properties of those relationships are also modeled using RosettaDock.

Hundreds of Variant Impact Predictors (VIPs), also known as Variant Effect Predictors (VEPs), have been developed for this purpose, with a variety of methodologies and goals. To facilitate the exploration of available VIP options, we have created the Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb).<h4>Results</h4>The Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb) version 2 presents a collection of VIPs developed over the past three decades, summarizing their characteristics, ClinGen calibrated scores, CAGI assessment results, publication details, access information, and citation patterns. We previously summarized 217 VIPs and their features in VIPdb in 2019. Building upon this foundation, we identified and categorized an additional 190 VIPs, resulting in a total of 407 VIPs in VIPdb version 2. The majority of the VIPs have the capacity to predict the impacts of single nucleotide variants and nonsynonymous variants. More VIPs tailored to predict the impacts of insertions and deletions have been developed since the 2010s. In contrast, relatively few VIPs are dedicated to the prediction of splicing, structural, synonymous, and regulatory variants. The increasing rate of citations to VIPs reflects the ongoing growth in their use, and the evolving trends in citations reveal development in the field and individual methods.<h4>Conclusions</h4>VIPdb version 2 summarizes 407 VIPs and their features, potentially facilitating VIP exploration for various variant interpretation applications. VIPdb is available at  https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb.",True,False,4.5,,,ipdb,16.80551934,ok,,of variant impact predictors | variant impact predictor database | vipdb).<h4 | the variant impact predictor database | clingen | vipdb).<h,vipdb,v2,0.80551934,"Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb), version",True,6.0,False,False,https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb,https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb,True,...terpretation applications. VIPdb is available at  https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb.,1
36350676,FAVOR: functional annotation of variants online resource and annotator for variation across the human genome.,"Large biobank-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies are rapidly identifying a multitude of coding and non-coding variants. They provide an unprecedented resource for illuminating the genetic basis of human diseases. Variant functional annotations play a critical role in WGS analysis, result interpretation, and prioritization of disease- or trait-associated causal variants. Existing functional annotation databases have limited scope to perform online queries and functionally annotate the genotype data of large biobank-scale WGS studies.

However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive evaluation and guidance for available reference-based deconvolution methods in cell-type deconvolution analysis. In this study, we introduce Deconvolution Evaluator (Deconer), a comprehensive toolkit for the evaluation of reference-based deconvolution methods. Deconer provides various simulated and real gene expression datasets, including both bulk and single-cell sequencing data, and offers multiple visualization interfaces.

38491529,OralExplorer: a web server for exploring the mechanisms of oral inflammatory diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Oral inflammatory diseases are localized infectious diseases primarily caused by oral pathogens with the potential for serious systemic complications. However, publicly available datasets for these diseases are underutilized. To address this issue, a web tool called OralExplorer was developed. This tool integrates the available data and provides comprehensive online bioinformatic analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>Human oral inflammatory disease-related datasets were obtained from the GEO database and normalized using a standardized process. Transcriptome data were then subjected to differential gene expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, correlation analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and visualization. The single-cell sequencing data was visualized as cluster plot, feature plot, and heatmaps. The web platform was primarily built using Shiny. The biomarkers identified in OralExplorer were validated using local clinical samples through qPCR and IHC.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 35 human oral inflammatory disease-related datasets, covering 6 main disease types and 901 samples, were included in the study to identify potential molecular signatures of the mechanisms of oral diseases. OralExplorer consists of 5 main analysis modules (differential gene expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, correlation analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and single-cell analysis), with multiple visualization options. The platform offers a simple and intuitive interface, high-quality images for visualization, and detailed analysis results tables for easy access by users. Six markers (IL1β, SRGN, CXCR1, FGR, ARHGEF2, and PTAFR) were identified by OralExplorer. qPCR- and IHC-based experimental validation showed significantly higher levels of these genes in the periodontitis group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OralExplorer is a comprehensive analytical platform for oral inflammatory diseases.

37484460,The <i>Viscum album</i> Gene Space database.,"The hemiparasitic flowering plant <i>Viscum album</i> (European mistletoe) is known for its very special life cycle, extraordinary biochemical properties, and extremely large genome. The size of its genome is estimated to be 30 times larger than the human genome and 600 times larger than the genome of the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. To achieve insights into the Gene Space of the genome, which is defined as the space including and surrounding protein-coding regions, a transcriptome project based on PacBio sequencing has recently been conducted. A database resulting from this project contains sequences of 39,092 different open reading frames encoding 32,064 distinct proteins. Based on 'Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs' (BUSCO) analysis, the completeness of the database was estimated to be in the range of 78%. To further develop this database, we performed a transcriptome project of <i>V. album</i> organs harvested in summer and winter based on Illumina sequencing. Data from both sequencing strategies were combined. The new <i>V. album</i> Gene Space database II (VaGs II) contains 90,039 sequences and has a completeness of 93% as revealed by BUSCO analysis. Sequences from other organisms, particularly fungi, which are known to colonize mistletoe leaves, have been removed. To evaluate the quality of the new database, proteome data of a mitochondrial fraction of <i>V. album</i> were re-analyzed. Compared to the original evaluation published five years ago, nearly 1000 additional proteins could be identified in the mitochondrial fraction, providing new insights into the Oxidative Phosphorylation System of <i>V. album</i>.

While significant efforts have been made to discover FBPs and to elucidate the underlying bioactivity mechanisms, there is lack of a systemic study of sequence-structure-activity relationship of FBPs in a large dataset.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we construct a database of food-derived bioactive peptides (DFBP), containing a total of 6276 peptide entries in 31 types from different sources. Further, we develop a series of analysis tools for function discovery/repurposing, traceability, multifunctional bioactive exploration and physiochemical property assessment of peptides. Finally, we apply this database and data-mining techniques to discover new FBPs as potential drugs for cardiovascular diseases.

One advantage of symbolic computation is its potential for qualitative answers to biological questions. Qualitative methods analyze dynamical input systems as formal objects, in contrast to investigating only part of the state space, as is the case with numerical simulation. However, corresponding tools and libraries have a different set of requirements for their input data than their numerical counterparts. A common format used in mathematical modeling of biological processes is Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We illustrate that the use of SBML data in symbolic computation requires significant pre-processing, incorporating external biological and mathematical expertise.

37216609,Human AGEs: an interactive spatio-temporal visualization and database of human archeogenomics.,"Archeogenomics is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary research field driven by the development of techniques that enable the acquisition and analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA). Recent advances in aDNA studies have contributed significantly to increasing our understanding of the natural history of humans. One of the most significant challenges facing archeogenomics is the integration of highly heterogeneous genomic, archeological, and anthropological data and their comprehensive analysis, considering changes that occur in time and space. Only this complex approach can explain the relationship between past populations in the context of migration or cultural development. To address these challenges, we developed a Human AGEs web server. It focuses on creating comprehensive spatiotemporal visualizations of genomic, archeogenomic, and archeological information, which can be provided by the user or loaded from a graph database. The interactive map application at the center of Human AGEs can display multiple layers of data in various forms, such as bubble charts, pie charts, heatmaps, or tag clouds.

The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is the primary detection method for most pathogens. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, simple, sensitive, and specific epitome of isothermal NAAT performed using a set of four to six primers. Primer design is a fundamental step in LAMP assays, with several complexities and experimental screening requirements. To address this challenge, an online database is presented here. Its workflow comprises three steps: literature aggregation, data curation, and database and website implementation.<h4>Results</h4>LAMPPrimerBank ( https://lampprimerbank.mathematik.uni-marburg.de ) is a manually curated database dedicated to experimentally validated LAMP primers, their peculiarities of assays, and accompanying literature, with a primary emphasis on respiratory pathogens. LAMPPrimerBank, with its user-friendly web interface and an open application programming interface, enables the accelerated and facile exploration, comparison, and exportation of LAMP primer sequences and their respective information from the massively scattered literature. LAMPPrimerBank currently comprises LAMP primers for diagnosing viral, bacterial, and fungal respiratory pathogens. Additionally, to address the challenge of false-positive results generated by nonspecific amplifications, LAMPPrimerBank computationally predicted and visualized the sizes of LAMP products for recorded primer sets in the database.<h4>Conclusion</h4>LAMPPrimerBank, as a pioneering database in the rapidly expanding field of isothermal NAAT, endeavors to confront the two challenges of the LAMP: primer design and discrimination of false-positive results.",True,False,3.5,,ampprimerbank,,16.79098356,ok,,lampprimerbank,lamp,v2,0.79098356,,True,5.0,False,False,https://lampprimerbank.mathematik.uni-marburg.de,https://lampprimerbank.mathematik.uni-marburg.de,True,...e implementation.<h4>Results</h4>LAMPPrimerBank ( https://lampprimerbank.mathematik.uni-marburg.de ) is a manually curated database dedicated to exp...,1

Developing accurate MLSFs for SBVS requires a large and unbiased dataset that includes structurally diverse actives and decoys. Unfortunately, most datasets suffer from hidden biases and data insufficiency. Here, we developed topology-based and conformation-based decoys database (ToCoDDB). The biological targets and active ligands in ToCoDDB were collected from scientific literature and established datasets. The decoys were generated and debiased by using conditional recurrent neural networks and molecular docking. ToCoDDB is presently the largest unbiased database with 2.4 million decoys encompassing 155 targets. The detailed information and performance benchmark for each target are provided, which are beneficial for training and evaluating MLSFs.

39351064,T-CLEARE: a pilot community-driven tissue clearing protocol repository.,"Selecting and implementing a tissue clearing protocol is challenging. Established more than 100 years ago, tissue clearing is still a rapidly evolving field of research. There are currently many published protocols to choose from, and each performs better or worse across a range of key evaluation factors (e.g., speed, cost, tissue stability, fluorescence quenching). Additionally, tissue clearing protocols are often optimized for specific experimental contexts, and applying an existing protocol to a new problem can require a lengthy period of adaptation by trial and error. Although the primary literature and review articles provide a useful starting point for optimization, there is growing recognition that results can vary dramatically with changes to tissue type or antibody used. To help address this issue, we have developed a novel, freely available repository of tissue clearing protocols named T-CLEARE (Tissue CLEAring protocol REpository; https://doryworkspace.org/doryviz). T-CLEARE incorporates community responses to an open survey designed to capture details not commonly found in the scientific literature, including modifications to published protocols required for specific use cases and instances when tissue clearing protocols did not perform well (negative results).

37399102,RNAenrich: a web server for non-coding RNA enrichment.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the rapid advances of RNA sequencing and microarray technologies in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, functional tools that perform enrichment analysis for ncRNAs are needed. On the one hand, because of the rapidly growing interest in circRNAs, snoRNAs, and piRNAs, it is essential to develop tools for enrichment analysis for these newly emerged ncRNAs. On the other hand, due to the key role of ncRNAs' interacting target in the determination of their function, the interactions between ncRNA and its corresponding target should be fully considered in functional enrichment. Based on the ncRNA-mRNA/protein-function strategy, some tools have been developed to functionally analyze a single type of ncRNA (the majority focuses on miRNA); in addition, some tools adopt predicted target data and lead to only low-confidence results.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, an online tool named RNAenrich was developed to enable the comprehensive and accurate enrichment analysis of ncRNAs. It is unique in (i) realizing the enrichment analysis for various RNA types in humans and mice, such as miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, snoRNA, piRNA, and mRNA; (ii) extending the analysis by introducing millions of experimentally validated data of RNA-target interactions as a built-in database; and (iii) providing a comprehensive interacting network among various ncRNAs and targets to facilitate the mechanistic study of ncRNA function. Importantly, RNAenrich led to a more comprehensive and accurate enrichment analysis in a COVID-19-related miRNA case, which was largely attributed to its coverage of comprehensive ncRNA-target interactions.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>RNAenrich is now freely accessible at https://idrblab.org/rnaenr/.",True,False,5.5,,naenrich,,16.7804042,ok,,rnaenrich | a web server for non-coding rna enrichment,,v2,0.7804042,RNAenrich,True,5.0,False,False,https://idrblab.org/rnaenr/,https://idrblab.org/rnaenr/,True,...ntation</h4>RNAenrich is now freely accessible at https://idrblab.org/rnaenr/.,1

Integrated 15 transcriptomic datasets of HCC clinical samples, the first version of HCC database (HCCDB v1.0) was released in 2018. Through the meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes and prognosis-related genes across multiple datasets, it provides a systematic view of the altered biological processes and the inter-patient heterogeneities of HCC with high reproducibility and robustness. With four years having passed, the database now needs integration of recently published datasets. Furthermore, the latest single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have provided a great opportunity to decipher complex gene expression variations at the cellular level with spatial architecture. Here, we present HCCDB v2.0, an updated version that combines bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic data of HCC clinical samples. It dramatically expands the bulk sample size by adding 1656 new samples from 11 datasets to the existing 3917 samples, thereby enhancing the reliability of transcriptomic meta-analysis.

38843230,Bioinformatics for Dentistry: A secondary database for the genetics of tooth development.,"Genes strictly regulate the development of teeth and their surrounding oral structures. Alteration of gene regulation leads to tooth disorders and developmental anomalies in tooth, oral, and facial regions. With the advancement of gene sequencing technology, genomic data is rapidly increasing. However, the large sets of genomic and proteomic data related to tooth development and dental disorders are currently dispersed in many primary databases and literature, making it difficult for users to navigate, extract, study, or analyze. We have curated the scattered genetic data on tooth development and created a knowledgebase called 'Bioinformatics for Dentistry' (https://dentalbioinformatics.com/). This database compiles genomic and proteomic data on human tooth development and developmental anomalies and organizes them according to their roles in different stages of tooth development. The database is built by systemically curating relevant data from the National Library of Medicine (NCBI) GenBank, OMIM: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, Reactome pathway knowledgebase, Wiki Pathways, and PubMed. The accuracy of the included data was verified from supporting primary literature. Upon data curation and validation, a simple, easy-to-navigate browser interface was created on WordPress version 6.3.2, with PHP version 8.0. The website is hosted in a cloud hosting service to provide fast and reliable data transfer rate. Plugins are used to ensure the browser's compatibility across different devices. Bioinformatics for Dentistry contains four embedded filters for complex and specific searches and free-text search options for quick and simple searching through the datasets. Bioinformatics for Dentistry is made freely available worldwide, with the hope that this knowledgebase will improve our understanding of the complex genetic regulation of tooth development and will open doors to research initiatives and discoveries.

39171722,Mapping autophagy-related membrane contact site proteins and complexes with AutoMCS Navigator.,"In eukaryotic cells, membrane contact sites (MCSs) mediate interactions and communication between organelles by bringing their membranes into close proximity without fusion. These sites play crucial roles in intracellular transport, signal transduction, and the regulation of organelle functions. In a recent study, we compiled data on MCS proteins and complexes from publications to create the MCSdb database. During data compilation, we discovered that many MCSs, their associated proteins, and complexes are highly relevant to macroautophagy/autophagy. To elucidate the role of MCSs in autophagy, we reorganized the autophagy-related MCS proteins and complexes from MCSdb, creating a data map called AutoMCS Navigator. The current version of this map includes 30 complexes and 84 proteins, covering 13 different MCSs and 7 species. Meanwhile, we embedded a dedicated webpage for AutoMCS Navigator on the MCSdb website. This webpage features an orchestrated visual guide that hierarchically displays MCS proteins and complexes involved in autophagy. In summary, our research has developed a user-friendly visual map for querying, browsing, and visualizing detailed information on autophagy-related MCS proteins and complexes. This tool offers researchers easy access to understand autophagy-related MCS structure, assembly, functions, and therapeutic strategies for related diseases.

39602824,Genome-wide identification of SSR markers from coding regions for endangered Argania spinosa L. skeels and construction of SSR database: AsSSRdb.,"Microsatellites [simple sequence repeats (SSRs)] are one of the most widely used sources of genetic markers, particularly prevalent in plants. Despite their importance in various applications, a comprehensive genome-wide identification of coding sequence (CDS)-associated SSR markers in the Argania spinosa L. genome has yet to be conducted. In this study, 66 280 CDSs containing 5351 SSRs within 4535 A. spinosa L. CDSs were identified. Among these, tri-nucleotide motifs (58.96%) were the most common, followed by hexa-nucleotide (15.71%) and di-nucleotide motifs (13.32%). The predominant SSR motif in the tri-nucleotide category was AAG (24.4%), while AG (94.1%) was the most abundant among di-nucleotide repeats. Furthermore, the extracted CDSs containing SSRs were subjected to functional annotation; 3396 CDSs (74.88%) exhibited homology with known proteins, 3341 CDSs (73.7%) were assigned Gene Ontology terms, 1004 CDSs were annotated with Enzyme Commission numbers, and 832 (18.3%) were annotated with KEGG pathways. A total of 3475 primer pairs were designed, out of which 3264 were successfully validated in silico against the A. spinosa L. genome, with 99.6% representing high-resolution markers yielding no more than three products. Additionally, the SSR markers demonstrated a low rate of transferability through in-silico verification in two species within the Sapotaceae family. Furthermore, we developed an online database, the ""Argania spinosa L. SSR database: https://as-fmmdb.shinyapps.io/asssrdb/"" (AsSSRdb) to provide access to the CDS-associated SSRs identified in this study.

38757367,Mutual annotation-based prediction of protein domain functions with Domain2GO.,"Identifying unknown functional properties of proteins is essential for understanding their roles in both health and disease states. The domain composition of a protein can reveal critical information in this context, as domains are structural and functional units that dictate how the protein should act at the molecular level. The expensive and time-consuming nature of wet-lab experimental approaches prompted researchers to develop computational strategies for predicting the functions of proteins. In this study, we proposed a new method called Domain2GO that infers associations between protein domains and function-defining gene ontology (GO) terms, thus redefining the problem as domain function prediction. Domain2GO uses documented protein-level GO annotations together with proteins' domain annotations. Co-annotation patterns of domains and GO terms in the same proteins are examined using statistical resampling to obtain reliable associations. As a use-case study, we evaluated the biological relevance of examples selected from the Domain2GO-generated domain-GO term mappings via literature review. Then, we applied Domain2GO to predict unknown protein functions by propagating domain-associated GO terms to proteins annotated with these domains. For function prediction performance evaluation and comparison against other methods, we employed Critical Assessment of Function Annotation 3 (CAFA3) challenge datasets. The results demonstrated the high potential of Domain2GO, particularly for predicting molecular function and biological process terms, along with advantages such as producing interpretable results and having an exceptionally low computational cost. The approach presented here can be extended to other ontologies and biological entities to investigate unknown relationships in complex and large-scale biological data. The source code, datasets, results, and user instructions for Domain2GO are available at https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/Domain2GO.

35616100,A Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM).,"Despite progress in the development of standards for describing and exchanging scientific information, the lack of easy-to-use standards for mapping between different representations of the same or similar objects in different databases poses a major impediment to data integration and interoperability. Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

36857575,kb_DRAM: annotation and metabolic profiling of genomes with DRAM in KBase.,"Microbial genome annotation is the process of identifying structural and functional elements in DNA sequences and subsequently attaching biological information to those elements. DRAM is a tool developed to annotate bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes derived from pure cultures or metagenomes. DRAM goes beyond traditional annotation tools by distilling multiple gene annotations to genome level summaries of functional potential. Despite these benefits, a downside of DRAM is the requirement of large computational resources, which limits its accessibility. Further, it did not integrate with downstream metabolic modeling tools that require genome annotation. To alleviate these constraints, DRAM and the viral counterpart, DRAM-v, are now available and integrated with the freely accessible KBase cyberinfrastructure. With kb_DRAM users can generate DRAM annotations and functional summaries from microbial or viral genomes in a point-and-click interface, as well as generate genome-scale metabolic models from DRAM annotations.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>For kb_DRAM users, the kb_DRAM apps on KBase can be found in the catalog at https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/kb_DRAM.

38776380,A terpenoids database with the chemical content as a novel agronomic trait.,"Natural products play a pivotal role in drug discovery, and the richness of natural products, albeit significantly influenced by various environmental factors, is predominantly determined by intrinsic genetics of a series of enzymatic reactions and produced as secondary metabolites of organisms. Heretofore, few natural product-related databases take the chemical content into consideration as a prominent property. To gain unique insights into the quantitative diversity of natural products, we have developed the first TerPenoids database embedded with Content information (TPCN) with features such as compound browsing, structural search, scaffold analysis, similarity analysis and data download. This database can be accessed through a web-based computational toolkit available at http://www.tpcn.pro/.

36376589,Metagenome-assembled genome extraction and analysis from microbiomes using KBase.,"Uncultivated Bacteria and Archaea account for the vast majority of species on Earth, but obtaining their genomes directly from the environment, using shotgun sequencing, has only become possible recently. To realize the hope of capturing Earth's microbial genetic complement and to facilitate the investigation of the functional roles of specific lineages in a given ecosystem, technologies that accelerate the recovery of high-quality genomes are necessary. We present a series of analysis steps and data products for the extraction of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from microbiomes using the U.S. Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) platform ( http://www.kbase.us/ ). Overall, these steps take about a day to obtain extracted genomes when starting from smaller environmental shotgun read libraries, or up to about a week from larger libraries. In KBase, the process is end-to-end, allowing a user to go from the initial sequencing reads all the way through to MAGs, which can then be analyzed with other KBase capabilities such as phylogenetic placement, functional assignment, metabolic modeling, pangenome functional profiling, RNA-Seq and others. While portions of such capabilities are available individually from other resources, the combination of the intuitive usability, data interoperability and integration of tools in a freely available computational resource makes KBase a powerful platform for obtaining MAGs from microbiomes.

34571541,Rossmann-toolbox: a deep learning-based protocol for the prediction and design of cofactor specificity in Rossmann fold proteins.,"The Rossmann fold enzymes are involved in essential biochemical pathways such as nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Their functioning relies on interaction with cofactors, small nucleoside-based compounds specifically recognized by a conserved βαβ motif shared by all Rossmann fold proteins. While Rossmann methyltransferases recognize only a single cofactor type, the S-adenosylmethionine, the oxidoreductases, depending on the family, bind nicotinamide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) or flavin-based (flavin adenine dinucleotide) cofactors. In this study, we showed that despite its short length, the βαβ motif unambiguously defines the specificity towards the cofactor. Following this observation, we trained two complementary deep learning models for the prediction of the cofactor specificity based on the sequence and structural features of the βαβ motif. A benchmark on two independent test sets, one containing βαβ motifs bearing no resemblance to those of the training set, and the other comprising 38 experimentally confirmed cases of rational design of the cofactor specificity, revealed the nearly perfect performance of the two methods.

37605971,The Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances: DEFID2.,"Insect and disease outbreaks in forests are biotic disturbances that can profoundly alter ecosystem dynamics. In many parts of the world, these disturbance regimes are intensifying as the climate changes and shifts the distribution of species and biomes. As a result, key forest ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, regulation of water flows, wood production, protection of soils, and the conservation of biodiversity, could be increasingly compromised. Despite the relevance of these detrimental effects, there are currently no spatially detailed databases that record insect and disease disturbances on forests at the pan-European scale. Here, we present the new Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances (DEFID2). It comprises over 650,000 harmonized georeferenced records, mapped as polygons or points, of insects and disease disturbances that occurred between 1963 and 2021 in European forests. The records currently span eight different countries and were acquired through diverse methods (e.g., ground surveys, remote sensing techniques). The records in DEFID2 are described by a set of qualitative attributes, including severity and patterns of damage symptoms, agents, host tree species, climate-driven trigger factors, silvicultural practices, and eventual sanitary interventions. They are further complemented with a satellite-based quantitative characterization of the affected forest areas based on Landsat Normalized Burn Ratio time series, and damage metrics derived from them using the LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm (including onset, duration, magnitude, and rate of the disturbance), and possible interactions with windthrow and wildfire events. The DEFID2 database is a novel resource for many large-scale applications dealing with biotic disturbances. It offers a unique contribution to design networks of experiments, improve our understanding of ecological processes underlying biotic forest disturbances, monitor their dynamics, and enhance their representation in land-climate models.

39288310,Biomedical knowledge graph-optimized prompt generation for large language models.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Large language models (LLMs) are being adopted at an unprecedented rate, yet still face challenges in knowledge-intensive domains such as biomedicine. Solutions such as pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, requiring further domain-expertise. Here, we introduce a token-optimized and robust Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging a massive biomedical KG (SPOKE) with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge.<h4>Results</h4>Compared to the existing RAG technique for Knowledge Graphs, the proposed method utilizes minimal graph schema for context extraction and uses embedding methods for context pruning. This optimization in context extraction results in more than 50% reduction in token consumption without compromising the accuracy, making a cost-effective and robust RAG implementation on proprietary LLMs. KG-RAG consistently enhanced the performance of LLMs across diverse biomedical prompts by generating responses rooted in established knowledge, accompanied by accurate provenance and statistical evidence (if available) to substantiate the claims. Further benchmarking on human curated datasets, such as biomedical true/false and multiple-choice questions (MCQ), showed a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain-specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In summary, the proposed framework combines explicit and implicit knowledge of KG and LLM in a token optimized fashion, thus enhancing the adaptability of general-purpose LLMs to tackle domain-specific questions in a cost-effective fashion.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>SPOKE KG can be accessed at https://spoke.rbvi.ucsf.edu/neighborhood.html.

35549894,Galbase: a comprehensive repository for integrating chicken multi-omics data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multi-omics data can provide a stereoscopic view to explore potential causal variations and genes, as well as underlying genetic mechanisms of complex traits. However, for many non-mammalian species, including chickens, these resources are poorly integrated and reused, greatly limiting genetic research and breeding processes of the species.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we constructed Galbase, an easily accessible repository that integrates public chicken multi-omics data from 928 re-sequenced genomes, 429 transcriptomes, 379 epigenomes, 15,275 QTL entries, and 7,526 associations. A total of 21.67 million SNPs, 2.71 million InDels, and 488,583 cis-regulatory elements were included. Galbase allows users to retrieve genomic variations in geographical maps, gene expression profiling in heatmaps, and epigenomic signals in peak patterns. It also provides modules for batch annotation of genes, regions, and loci based on multi-layered omics data.

39101502,DiffPROTACs is a deep learning-based generator for proteolysis targeting chimeras.,"PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has recently emerged as a promising technology. However, the design of rational PROTACs, especially the linker component, remains challenging due to the absence of structure-activity relationships and experimental data. Leveraging the structural characteristics of PROTACs, fragment-based drug design (FBDD) provides a feasible approach for PROTAC research. Concurrently, artificial intelligence-generated content has attracted considerable attention, with diffusion models and Transformers emerging as indispensable tools in this field. In response, we present a new diffusion model, DiffPROTACs, harnessing the power of Transformers to learn and generate new PROTAC linkers based on given ligands. To introduce the essential inductive biases required for molecular generation, we propose the O(3) equivariant graph Transformer module, which augments Transformers with graph neural networks (GNNs), using Transformers to update nodes and GNNs to update the coordinates of PROTAC atoms. DiffPROTACs effectively competes with existing models and achieves comparable performance on two traditional FBDD datasets, ZINC and GEOM. To differentiate the molecular characteristics between PROTACs and traditional small molecules, we fine-tuned the model on our self-built PROTACs dataset, achieving a 93.86% validity rate for generated PROTACs. Additionally, we provide a generated PROTAC database for further research, which can be accessed at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/service/DiffPROTACs-generated.tgz.

35687095,The Ocean Gene Atlas v2.0: online exploration of the biogeography and phylogeny of plankton genes.,"Testing hypothesis about the biogeography of genes using large data resources such as Tara Oceans marine metagenomes and metatranscriptomes requires significant hardware resources and programming skills. The new release of the 'Ocean Gene Atlas' (OGA2) is a freely available intuitive online service to mine large and complex marine environmental genomic databases. OGA2 datasets available have been extended and now include, from the Tara Oceans portfolio: (i) eukaryotic Metagenome-Assembled-Genomes (MAGs) and Single-cell Assembled Genomes (SAGs) (10.2E+6 coding genes), (ii) version 2 of Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalogue (46.8E+6 non-redundant genes), (iii) 924 MetaGenomic Transcriptomes (7E+6 unigenes), (iv) 530 MAGs from an Arctic MAG catalogue (1E+6 genes) and (v) 1888 Bacterial and Archaeal Genomes (4.5E+6 genes), and an additional dataset from the Malaspina 2010 global circumnavigation: (vi) 317 Malaspina Deep Metagenome Assembled Genomes (0.9E+6 genes). Novel analyses enabled by OGA2 include phylogenetic tree inference to visualize user queries within their context of sequence homologues from both the marine environmental dataset and the RefSeq database. An Application Programming Interface (API) now allows users to query OGA2 using command-line tools, hence providing local workflow integration.

37431591,Adding open spectral data to MassBank and PubChem using open source tools to support non-targeted exposomics of mixtures.,"The term ""exposome"" is defined as a comprehensive study of life-course environmental exposures and the associated biological responses. Humans are exposed to many different chemicals, which can pose a major threat to the well-being of humanity. Targeted or non-targeted mass spectrometry techniques are widely used to identify and characterize various environmental stressors when linking exposures to human health. However, identification remains challenging due to the huge chemical space applicable to exposomics, combined with the lack of sufficient relevant entries in spectral libraries. Addressing these challenges requires cheminformatics tools and database resources to share curated open spectral data on chemicals to improve the identification of chemicals in exposomics studies. This article describes efforts to contribute spectra relevant for exposomics to the open mass spectral library MassBank (https://www.massbank.eu) using various open source software efforts, including the R packages RMassBank and Shinyscreen. The experimental spectra were obtained from ten mixtures containing toxicologically relevant chemicals from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT). Following processing and curation, 5582 spectra from 783 of the 1268 ENTACT compounds were added to MassBank, and through this to other open spectral libraries (<i>e.g.</i>, MoNA, GNPS) for community benefit. Additionally, an automated deposition and annotation workflow was developed with PubChem to enable the display of all MassBank mass spectra in PubChem, which is rerun with each MassBank release.

35748708,"The Practical Haplotype Graph, a platform for storing and using pangenomes for imputation.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Pangenomes provide novel insights for population and quantitative genetics, genomics and breeding not available from studying a single reference genome. Instead, a species is better represented by a pangenome or collection of genomes. Unfortunately, managing and using pangenomes for genomically diverse species is computationally and practically challenging. We developed a trellis graph representation anchored to the reference genome that represents most pangenomes well and can be used to impute complete genomes from low density sequence or variant data.<h4>Results</h4>The Practical Haplotype Graph (PHG) is a pangenome pipeline, database (PostGRES & SQLite), data model (Java, Kotlin or R) and Breeding API (BrAPI) web service. The PHG has already been able to accurately represent diversity in four major crops including maize, one of the most genomically diverse species, with up to 1000-fold data compression. Using simulated data, we show that, at even 0.1× coverage, with appropriate reads and sequence alignment, imputation results in extremely accurate haplotype reconstruction. The PHG is a platform and environment for the understanding and application of genomic diversity.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All resources listed here are freely available.

36596370,GPApred: The first computational predictor for identifying proteins with LPXTG-like motif using sequence-based optimal features.,"The cell surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria are involved in many important biological functions, including the infection of host cells. Owing to their virulent nature, these proteins are also considered strong candidates for potential drug or vaccine targets. Among the various cell surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria, LPXTG-like proteins form a major class. These proteins have a highly conserved C-terminal cell wall sorting signal, which consists of an LPXTG sequence motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a positively charged tail. These surface proteins are targeted to the cell envelope by a sortase enzyme via transpeptidation. A variety of LPXTG-like proteins have been experimentally characterized; however, their number in public databases has increased owing to extensive bacterial genome sequencing without proper annotation. In the absence of experimental characterization, identifying and annotating these sequences is extremely challenging. Therefore, in this study, we developed the first machine learning-based predictor called GPApred, which can identify LPXTG-like proteins from their primary sequences. Using a newly constructed benchmark dataset, we explored different classifiers and five feature encodings and their hybrids. Optimal features were derived using the recursive feature elimination method, and these features were then trained using a support vector machine algorithm. The performance of different models was evaluated using independent datasets, and a final model (GPApred) was selected based on consistency during cross-validation and independent assessment. GPApred can be an effective tool for predicting LPXTG-like sequences and can be further employed for functional characterization or drug targeting.

37526283,JGI Plant Gene Atlas: an updateable transcriptome resource to improve functional gene descriptions across the plant kingdom.,"Gene functional descriptions offer a crucial line of evidence for candidate genes underlying trait variation. Conversely, plant responses to environmental cues represent important resources to decipher gene function and subsequently provide molecular targets for plant improvement through gene editing. However, biological roles of large proportions of genes across the plant phylogeny are poorly annotated. Here we describe the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Plant Gene Atlas, an updateable data resource consisting of transcript abundance assays spanning 18 diverse species. To integrate across these diverse genotypes, we analyzed expression profiles, built gene clusters that exhibited tissue/condition specific expression, and tested for transcriptional response to environmental queues. We discovered extensive phylogenetically constrained and condition-specific expression profiles for genes without any previously documented functional annotation. Such conserved expression patterns and tightly co-expressed gene clusters let us assign expression derived additional biological information to 64 495 genes with otherwise unknown functions. The ever-expanding Gene Atlas resource is available at JGI Plant Gene Atlas (https://plantgeneatlas.jgi.doe.gov) and Phytozome (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/), providing bulk access to data and user-specified queries of gene sets.

37356898,Operon Finder: A Deep Learning-based Web Server for Accurate Prediction of Prokaryotic Operons.,"Operons are groups of consecutive genes that transcribe together under the regulation of a common promoter. They influence protein regulation and various physiological pathways, making their accurate detection desirable. The detection of operons through experimental means is a laborious and financially intensive process. Therefore, human experts predict potential operons utilizing their prior knowledge of the genetic organization and functional correlation of the genes. However, with the rise in the number of completely sequenced genomes, the development of automated algorithms, tools, and web servers is highly preferred over manual detection for operon prediction. Currently available state-of-the-art algorithms use a deep learning-based model to predict if the adjacent genes belong to the same operons in the given genome. However, these require an understanding of programming knowledge and computational skills, making them not-very user friendly. In this study, we developed a user-friendly web service, Operon Finder, for on-the-fly prediction of operons using the deep learning method. The interface provides a facility for genome search, operon live-filtering, viewing operonic DNA sequences, downloading predicted results, and links for data retrieval from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database.

40483547,Systematic identification of cancer-type-specific drugs based on essential genes and validations in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Depicting a global landscape of essential gene-targeting drugs would provide more opportunities for cancer therapy. However, a systematic investigation on drugs targeting essential genes still has not been reported. We suppose that drugs targeting cancer-type-specific essential genes would generally have less toxicity than those targeting pan-cancer essential genes. A scoring function-based strategy was developed to identify cancer-type-specific targets and drugs. The EssentialitySpecificityScore ranked the essential genes in 19 cancer types, and 1151 top genes were identified as cancer-type-specific targets. Combining target-drug interaction databases with research/marketing status, 370 cancer-type-specific drugs were identified, bound to 100 out of all identified targets. Profiles of applied cancer types of identified targets and drugs illustrate the scoring strategy's effectiveness: most drugs apply to cancer types <10. Seven drugs with no previous anticancer evidence were validated in 11 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, and lower inhibition rates (from 9.4% to 44.0%) were observed in 10 normal cell lines. This difference is statistically significant (Student's t-test, P ≤ .0001), confirming the rationality of our supposition. Our built EGKG (Essential Gene Knowledge Graph) forms a computational basis to uncover essential gene targets and drugs for specific cancer types. It is available at http://gepa.org.cn/egkg/.

37566336,The Children's Picture Books Lexicon (CPB-LEX): A large-scale lexical database from children's picture books.,"This article presents CPB-LEX, a large-scale database of lexical statistics derived from children's picture books (age range 0-8 years). Such a database is essential for research in psychology, education and computational modelling, where rich details on the vocabulary of early print exposure are required. CPB-LEX was built through an innovative method of computationally extracting lexical information from automatic speech-to-text captions and subtitle tracks generated from social media channels dedicated to reading picture books aloud. It consists of approximately 25,585 types (wordforms) and their frequency norms (raw and Zipf-transformed), a lexicon of bigrams (two-word sequences and their transitional probabilities) and a document-term matrix (which shows the importance of each word in the corpus in each book). Several immediate contributions of CPB-LEX to behavioural science research are reported, including that the new CPB-LEX frequency norms strongly predict age of acquisition and outperform comparable child-input lexical databases. The database allows researchers and practitioners to extract lexical statistics for high-frequency words which can be used to develop word lists. The paper concludes with an investigation of how CPB-LEX can be used to extend recent modelling research on the lexical diversity children receive from picture books in addition to child-directed speech. Our model shows that the vocabulary input from a relatively small number of picture books can dramatically enrich vocabulary exposure from child-directed speech and potentially assist children with vocabulary input deficits.

Our newly updated database shows several improvements: (i) it comprises more entries and families because it includes both Acrs reported in the most recent literatures and Acrs obtained via performing homologous alignment; (ii) the prediction of Acr neighbors is integrated into Anti-CRISPRdb v2.2, and users can identify novel Acrs from these candidates; and (iii) this version includes experimental information on the inhibitory strength and stage for Acr-Cas/Acr-CRISPR pairs, motivating the development of tools for predicting specific inhibitory abilities. Additionally, a parameter, the rank of codon usage bias (CUBRank), was proposed and provided in the new version, which showed a positive relationship with predicted result from AcRanker; hence, it can be used as an indicator for proteins to be Acrs. CUBRank can be used to estimate the possibility of genes occurring within genome island-a hotspot hosting potential genes encoding Acrs. Based on CUBRank and Anti-CRISPRdb, we also gave the first glimpse for the emergence of Acr genes (acrs).<h4>Database url</h4>http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb.",True,False,4.0,,risprdb,,16.698007099999998,ok,,anti-crisprdb | cubrank,,v2,0.6980071,Anti-CRISPRdb,True,6.0,False,False,http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb,http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb,True,...mergence of Acr genes (acrs).<h4>Database url</h4>http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb.,1
35111182,The Grape Gene Reference Catalogue as a Standard Resource for Gene Selection and Genetic Improvement.,"Effective crop improvement, whether through selective breeding or biotech strategies, is largely dependent on the cumulative knowledge of a species' pangenome and its containing genes. Acquiring this knowledge is specially challenging in grapevine, one of the oldest fruit crops grown worldwide, which is known to have more than 30,000 genes. Well-established research communities studying model organisms have created and maintained, through public and private funds, a diverse range of online tools and databases serving as repositories of genomes and gene function data. The lack of such resources for the non-model, but economically important, <i>Vitis vinifera</i> species has driven the need for a standardised collection of genes within the grapevine community. In an effort led by the Integrape COST Action CA17111, we have recently developed the first grape gene reference catalogue, where genes are ascribed to functional data, including their accession identifiers from different genome-annotation versions (https://integrape.eu/resources/genes-genomes/). We present and discuss this gene repository together with a validation-level scheme based on varied supporting evidence found in current literature. The catalogue structure and online submission form provided permits community curation. Finally, we present the Gene Cards tool, developed within the Vitis Visualization (VitViz) platform, to visualize the data collected in the catalogue and link gene function with tissue-specific expression derived from public transcriptomic data.

37930837,INTEDE 2.0: the metabolic roadmap of drugs.,"The metabolic roadmap of drugs (MRD) is a comprehensive atlas for understanding the stepwise and sequential metabolism of certain drug in living organisms. It plays a vital role in lead optimization, personalized medication, and ADMET research. The MRD consists of three main components: (i) the sequential catalyses of drug and its metabolites by different drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), (ii) a comprehensive collection of metabolic reactions along the entire MRD and (iii) a systematic description on efficacy & toxicity for all metabolites of a studied drug. However, there is no database available for describing the comprehensive metabolic roadmaps of drugs. Therefore, in this study, a major update of INTEDE was conducted, which provided the stepwise & sequential metabolic roadmaps for a total of 4701 drugs, and a total of 22 165 metabolic reactions containing 1088 DMEs and 18 882 drug metabolites. Additionally, the INTEDE 2.0 labeled the pharmacological properties (pharmacological activity or toxicity) of metabolites and provided their structural information. Furthermore, 3717 drug metabolism relationships were supplemented (from 7338 to 11 055). All in all, INTEDE 2.0 is highly expected to attract broad interests from related research community and serve as an essential supplement to existing pharmaceutical/biological/chemical databases.

39401061,The Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal and Duotang: open resources for SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences and genomic epidemiology.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a large global effort to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patient samples to track viral evolution and inform the public health response. Millions of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been deposited in global public repositories. The Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN - VirusSeq), a consortium tasked with coordinating expanded sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across Canada early in the pandemic, created the Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal, with associated data pipelines and procedures, to support these efforts. The goal of VirusSeq was to allow open access to Canadian SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and enhanced, standardized contextual data that were unavailable in other repositories and that meet FAIR standards (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). In addition, the portal data submission pipeline contains data quality checking procedures and appropriate acknowledgement of data generators that encourages collaboration. From inception to execution, the portal was developed with a conscientious focus on strong data governance principles and practices. Extensive efforts ensured a commitment to Canadian privacy laws, data security standards, and organizational processes. This portal has been coupled with other resources, such as Viral AI, and was further leveraged by the Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network (CoVaRR-Net) to produce a suite of continually updated analytical tools and notebooks. Here we highlight this portal (https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/), including its contextual data not available elsewhere, and the Duotang (https://covarr-net.github.io/duotang/duotang.html), a web platform that presents key genomic epidemiology and modelling analyses on circulating and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in Canada. Duotang presents dynamic changes in variant composition of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada and by province, estimates variant growth, and displays complementary interactive visualizations, with a text overview of the current situation. The VirusSeq Data Portal and Duotang resources, alongside additional analyses and resources computed from the portal (COVID-MVP, CoVizu), are all open source and freely available.

35809063,RNAloops: a database of RNA multiloops.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Knowledge of the 3D structure of RNA supports discovering its functions and is crucial for designing drugs and modern therapeutic solutions. Thus, much attention is devoted to experimental determination and computational prediction targeting the global fold of RNA and its local substructures. The latter include multi-branched loops-functionally significant elements that highly affect the spatial shape of the entire molecule. Unfortunately, their computational modeling constitutes a weak point of structural bioinformatics. A remedy for this is in collecting these motifs and analyzing their features.<h4>Results</h4>RNAloops is a self-updating database that stores multi-branched loops identified in the PDB-deposited RNA structures. A description of each loop includes angular data-planar and Euler angles computed between pairs of adjacent helices to allow studying their mutual arrangement in space.

A lack of large proteomic datasets has restricted the identification of new cancer biomarkers. Here, proteomes of 949 cancer cell lines across 28 tissue types are analyzed by mass spectrometry. Deploying a workflow to quantify 8,498 proteins, these data capture evidence of cell-type and post-transcriptional modifications. Integrating multi-omics, drug response, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens with a deep learning-based pipeline reveals thousands of protein biomarkers of cancer vulnerabilities that are not significant at the transcript level. The power of the proteome to predict drug response is very similar to that of the transcriptome. Further, random downsampling to only 1,500 proteins has limited impact on predictive power, consistent with protein networks being highly connected and co-regulated.

36309134,MPAD: A Database for Binding Affinity of Membrane Protein-protein Complexes and their Mutants.,"Membrane protein complexes are crucial for a large variety of biological functions which are mainly dictated by their binding affinity. Due to the intricate nature of their structure, however, the binding affinity of membrane proteins is less explored compared to globular proteins. Mutations in these complexes affect their binding affinity, as well as impair critical functions, and may lead to diseases. Although experimental binding affinity data have expanded in the literature, they are dispersed and it is necessary to compile them into a reliable and comprehensive database. Hence, we developed MPAD (Membrane Protein complex binding Affinity Database), which contains experimental binding affinities of membrane protein-protein complexes and their mutants along with sequence, structure, and functional information, membrane-specific features, experimental conditions, as well as literature information. MPAD has an easy-to-use interface and options to build search queries, display, sort, download, and upload the data are among the other features available to users. This database can be used to understand the factors influencing the binding affinity in membrane proteins when compared to globular proteins as well as the impact of mutations on binding affinity, which may have potential applications to structure-based drug design.

40133783,Phyre2.2: A Community Resource for Template-based Protein Structure Prediction.,"Template-based modelling, also known as homology modelling, is a powerful approach to predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. The approach requires one to identify a sequence similarity between the query sequence and that of a known structure as they will adopt a similar conformation, and the known structure can be used as the template for modelling the query sequence. Recently several approaches, most notably AlphaFold, have employed enhanced machine learning and have yielded accurate models irrespective of whether there is an identifiable template. Here we report Phyre2.2 which incorporates several enhancements to our widely-used template modelling portal Phyre2. The main development is facilitating a user to submit their sequence and then Phyre2.2 identifies the most suitable AlphaFold model to be used as a template.

36732606,The human microbial exposome: expanding the Exposome-Explorer database with gut microbial metabolites.,"Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota play an important role in the cross-talk with the human host. Many microbial metabolites are biologically active and can pass the gut barrier and make it into the systemic circulation, where they form the gut microbial exposome, i.e. the totality of gut microbial metabolites in body fluids or tissues of the host. A major difficulty faced when studying the microbial exposome and its role in health and diseases is to differentiate metabolites solely or partially derived from microbial metabolism from those produced by the host or coming from the diet. Our objective was to collect data from the scientific literature and build a database on gut microbial metabolites and on evidence of their microbial origin. Three types of evidence on the microbial origin of the gut microbial exposome were defined: (1) metabolites are produced in vitro by human faecal bacteria; (2) metabolites show reduced concentrations in humans or experimental animals upon treatment with antibiotics; (3) metabolites show reduced concentrations in germ-free animals when compared with conventional animals. Data was manually collected from peer-reviewed publications and inserted in the Exposome-Explorer database. Furthermore, to explore the chemical space of the microbial exposome and predict metabolites uniquely formed by the microbiota, genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) of gut bacterial strains and humans were compared. A total of 1848 records on one or more types of evidence on the gut microbial origin of 457 metabolites was collected in Exposome-Explorer. Data on their known precursors and concentrations in human blood, urine and faeces was also collected. About 66% of the predicted gut microbial metabolites (n = 1543) were found to be unique microbial metabolites not found in the human GSMM, neither in the list of 457 metabolites curated in Exposome-Explorer, and can be targets for new experimental studies.

37236629,Deep-Masker: A Deep Learning-based Tool to Assess Chord Length from Murine Lung Images.,"Chord length is an indirect measure of alveolar size and a critical endpoint in animal models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In assessing chord length, the lumens of nonalveolar structures are eliminated from measurement by various methods, including manual masking. However, manual masking is resource intensive and can introduce variability and bias. We created a fully automated deep learning-based tool to mask murine lung images and assess chord length to facilitate mechanistic and therapeutic discovery in COPD called Deep-Masker (available at http://47.93.0.75:8110/login). We trained the deep learning algorithm for Deep-Masker using 1,217 images from 137 mice from 12 strains exposed to room air or cigarette smoke for 6 months. We validated this algorithm against manual masking. Deep-Masker demonstrated high accuracy with an average difference in chord length compared with manual masking of -0.3 ± 1.4% (<i>r</i>s = 0.99) for room-air-exposed mice and 0.7 ± 1.9% (<i>r</i>s = 0.99) for cigarette-smoke-exposed mice. The difference between Deep-Masker and manually masked images for change in chord length because of cigarette smoke exposure was 6.0 ± 9.2% (<i>r</i>s = 0.95). These values exceed published estimates for interobserver variability for manual masking (<i>r</i>s = 0.65) and the accuracy of published algorithms by a significant margin.

38385146,CDBProm: the Comprehensive Directory of Bacterial Promoters.,"The decreasing cost of whole genome sequencing has produced high volumes of genomic information that require annotation. The experimental identification of promoter sequences, pivotal for regulating gene expression, is a laborious and cost-prohibitive task. To expedite this, we introduce the Comprehensive Directory of Bacterial Promoters (CDBProm), a directory of <i>in-silico</i> predicted bacterial promoter sequences. We first identified that an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm would distinguish promoters from random downstream regions with an accuracy of 87%. To capture distinctive promoter signals, we generated a second XGBoost classifier trained on the instances misclassified in our first classifier. The predictor of CDBProm is then fed with over 55 million upstream regions from more than 6000 bacterial genomes. Upon finding potential promoter sequences in upstream regions, each promoter is mapped to the genomic data of the organism, linking the predicted promoter with its coding DNA sequence, and identifying the function of the gene regulated by the promoter. The collection of bacterial promoters available in CDBProm enables the quantitative analysis of a plethora of bacterial promoters.

38872612,MARS and RNAcmap3: The Master Database of All Possible RNA Sequences Integrated with RNAcmap for RNA Homology Search.,"Recent success of AlphaFold2 in protein structure prediction relied heavily on co-evolutionary information derived from homologous protein sequences found in the huge, integrated database of protein sequences (Big Fantastic Database). In contrast, the existing nucleotide databases were not consolidated to facilitate wider and deeper homology search. Here, we built a comprehensive database by incorporating the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences from RNAcentral, the transcriptome assembly and metagenome assembly from metagenomics RAST (MG-RAST), the genomic sequences from Genome Warehouse (GWH), and the genomic sequences from MGnify, in addition to the nucleotide (nt) database and its subsets in National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The resulting Master database of All possible RNA sequences (MARS) is 20-fold larger than NCBI's nt database or 60-fold larger than RNAcentral. The new dataset along with a new split-search strategy allows a substantial improvement in homology search over existing state-of-the-art techniques. It also yields more accurate and more sensitive multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) than manually curated MSAs from Rfam for the majority of structured RNAs mapped to Rfam.

38395961,"""DompeKeys"": a set of novel substructure-based descriptors for efficient chemical space mapping, development and structural interpretation of machine learning models, and indexing of large databases.","The conversion of chemical structures into computer-readable descriptors, able to capture key structural aspects, is of pivotal importance in the field of cheminformatics and computer-aided drug design. Molecular fingerprints represent a widely employed class of descriptors; however, their generation process is time-consuming for large databases and is susceptible to bias. Therefore, descriptors able to accurately detect predefined structural fragments and devoid of lengthy generation procedures would be highly desirable. To meet additional needs, such descriptors should also be interpretable by medicinal chemists, and suitable for indexing databases with trillions of compounds. To this end, we developed-as integral part of EXSCALATE, Dompé's end-to-end drug discovery platform-the DompeKeys (DK), a new substructure-based descriptor set, which encodes the chemical features that characterize compounds of pharmaceutical interest. DK represent an exhaustive collection of curated SMARTS strings, defining chemical features at different levels of complexity, from specific functional groups and structural patterns to simpler pharmacophoric points, corresponding to a network of hierarchically interconnected substructures. Because of their extended and hierarchical structure, DK can be used, with good performance, in different kinds of applications. In particular, we demonstrate how they are very well suited for effective mapping of chemical space, as well as substructure search and virtual screening. Notably, the incorporation of DK yields highly performing machine learning models for the prediction of both compounds' activity and metabolic reaction occurrence. The protocol to generate the DK is freely available at https://dompekeys.exscalate.eu and is fully integrated with the Molecular Anatomy protocol for the generation and analysis of hierarchically interconnected molecular scaffolds and frameworks, thus providing a comprehensive and flexible tool for drug design applications.",True,False,3.5,,,d,16.65803605,ok,d | dompekeys,dompekeys,,v2,0.65803605,"""DompeKeys""",True,5.0,False,False,https://dompekeys.exscalate.eu,https://dompekeys.exscalate.eu,True,...rotocol to generate the DK is freely available at https://dompekeys.exscalate.eu and is fully integrated with the Molecular Anatom...,1

However, the majority of existing methods were limited to only sequencing candidate variants, and the process of linking these variants to a diagnosis of genetic disorders still required medical professionals to consult databases. Therefore, we introduce diseaseGPS, an integrated platform for the diagnosis of genetic disorders that combines both phenotype and genotype data for analysis. It offers not only a user-friendly GUI web application for those without a programming background but also scripts that can be executed in batch mode for bioinformatics professionals. The genetic and phenotypic data are integrated using the ACMG-Bayes method and a novel phenotypic similarity method, to prioritize the results of genetic disorders. diseaseGPS was evaluated on 6085 cases from Deciphering Developmental Disorders project and 187 cases from Shanghai Children's hospital.

Previously, we created a mini foxtail millet, xiaomi, with an Arabidopsis-like life cycle. The de novo assembled genome data with high-quality and an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system made xiaomi an ideal C<sub>4</sub> model system. The mini foxtail millet has been widely shared in the research community and as a result there is a growing need for a user-friendly portal and intuitive interface to perform exploratory analysis of the data.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we built a Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica (MDSi, http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm ), that contains xiaomi genome of 161,844 annotations, 34,436 protein-coding genes and their expression information in 29 different tissues of xiaomi (6) and JG21 (23) samples that can be showed as an Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph (xEFP) in-situ.

The SNPs and Indels of these germplasms were called in advance and can be searched and compared in an interactive manner. Common tools including BLAST, GBrowse, JBrowse, map viewer, and data downloads were implemented in MDSi.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The MDSi constructed in this study integrated and visualized data from three levels of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, and also provides information on the variation of hundreds of germplasm resources that can satisfies the mainstream requirements and supports the corresponding research community.",True,False,4.5,,omics database,,16.65356284,ok,,multi-omics database for | mdsi.<h4,mdsi | xiaomi,v2,0.65356284,MDSi,True,5.0,False,False,http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm,http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm,True,"...a Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica (MDSi, http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm ), that contains xiaomi genome of 161,844 annotat...",1
35147037,PPI-Hotspot<sup>DB</sup>: Database of Protein-Protein Interaction Hot Spots.,"Single-point mutations of certain residues (so-called hot spots) impair/disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs), leading to pathogenesis and drug resistance. Conventionally, a PPI-hot spot is identified when its replacement decreased the binding free energy significantly, generally by ≥2 kcal/mol. The relatively few mutations with such a significant binding free energy drop limited the number of distinct PPI-hot spots. By defining PPI-hot spots based on mutations that have been manually curated in UniProtKB to significantly impair/disrupt PPIs in addition to binding free energy changes, we have greatly expanded the number of distinct PPI-hot spots by an order of magnitude. These experimentally determined PPI-hot spots along with available structures have been collected in a database called PPI-Hotspot<sup>DB</sup>. We have applied the PPI-Hotspot<sup>DB</sup> to create a nonredundant benchmark, PPI-Hotspot+PDB<sup>BM</sup>, for assessing methods to predict PPI-hot spots using the free structure as input.

In early 2020, we developed a manually curated database named 'lncR2metasta' to provide a comprehensive repository for long ncRNA (lncRNA) regulation during CMEs. We updated this database by supplementing other two important ncRNA types, microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), for their involvement during CMEs after a thorough manual curation from published studies. ncR2metasta documents 1565 lncRNA-associated, 882 miRNA-associated, and 628 circRNA-associated entries for ncRNA-CME associations during 50 CMEs across 63 human cancer subtypes. ncR2Met has a concise web interface for researchers to easily browse, search and download as well as to submit novel ncRNA-CME associations.

35806459,TritiKBdb: A Functional Annotation Resource for Deciphering the Complete Interaction Networks in Wheat-Karnal Bunt Pathosystem.,"The study of molecular interactions, especially the inter-species protein-protein interactions, is crucial for understanding the disease infection mechanism in plants. These interactions play an important role in disease infection and host immune responses against pathogen attack. Among various critical fungal diseases, the incidences of Karnal bunt (<i>Tilletia indica</i>) around the world have hindered the export of the crops such as wheat from infected regions, thus causing substantial economic losses. Due to sparse information on <i>T. indica</i>, limited insight is available with regard to gaining in-depth knowledge of the interaction mechanisms between the host and pathogen proteins during the disease infection process. Here, we report the development of a comprehensive database and webserver, <i>TritiKBdb</i>, that implements various tools to study the protein-protein interactions in the <i>Triticum species</i>-<i>Tilletia indica</i> pathosystem. The novel 'interactomics' tool allows the user to visualize/compare the networks of the predicted interactions in an enriched manner. <i>TritiKBdb</i> is a user-friendly database that provides functional annotations such as subcellular localization, available domains, KEGG pathways, and GO terms of the host and pathogen proteins. Additionally, the information about the host and pathogen proteins that serve as transcription factors and effectors, respectively, is also made available.

35150127,GNIFdb: a neoantigen intrinsic feature database for glioma.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Neoantigens are mutation-containing immunogenic peptides from tumor cells. Neoantigen intrinsic features are neoantigens' sequence-associated features characterized by different amino acid descriptors and physical-chemical properties, which have a crucial function in prioritization of neoantigens with immunogenic potentials and predicting patients with better survival. Different intrinsic features might have functions to varying degrees in evaluating neoantigens' potentials of immunogenicity. Identification and comparison of intrinsic features among neoantigens are particularly important for developing neoantigen-based personalized immunotherapy. However, there is still no public repository to host the intrinsic features of neoantigens. Therefore, we developed GNIFdb, a glioma neoantigen intrinsic feature database specifically designed for hosting, exploring and visualizing neoantigen and intrinsic features. The database provides a comprehensive repository of computationally predicted Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) restricted neoantigens and their intrinsic features; a systematic annotation of neoantigens including sequence, neoantigen-associated mutation, gene expression, glioma prognosis, HLA-I subtype and binding affinity between neoantigens and HLA-I; and a genome browser to visualize them in an interactive manner.

39874126,BbGSD: Black-boned Sheep Genome SNP Database.,"Lanping black-boned (LPBB) sheep are a unique and rare ruminant species, characterized by black pigmentation in the skin and internal organs. Thus far, LPBB are the only known animal with heritable melanin characteristics besides the black-boned chicken, and the only mammal known to contain a large amount of melanin in the body. LPBB have therefore attracted substantial research attention, due to their potential contribution to medicine. However, long periods of grazing freely and crossbreeding with Lanping normal sheep (LPN) have diluted LPBB breeding resources, posing a challenge to the protection of species. To ensure the effective conservation and management of LPBB genetic resources, the construction of a large-scale database of genotypic information is therefore very important. To achieve this, we established the first LPBB-specific SNP database, named Black-boned Sheep Genome SNP Database (BbGSD, http://202.203.179.115:3838/oarsnpdb) using sheep genotype data (100 LPBB and 50 LPN) across 46 894 242 SNP sites. In this database, we implemented four main function modules: (i) the ""LD heatmap"" module, which uses a heatmap to enable the interactive visualization of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurements between SNPs; (ii) the ""SNP distribution"" module, which allows users to interactively visualize tabular genotype data as heat maps; (iii) the ""Phylogenetics"" module which enables phylogenetic analysis to explore the evolutionary history or genetic relationships of the LPBB sheep; and the ""Diversity"" module, which can be used to calculate and display the nucleotide diversity among sheep populations in user-specified genomic regions. BbGSD is essential for accelerating studies on the functional genomics and screening of molecular markers of molecular-assisted breeding in black-boned sheep.

The volume of animal gut metagenomic data, including both 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data, has been increasing exponentially in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to query, retrieve, and reanalyze experimental data and explore new hypotheses. We designed a database called the domestic animal gut microbiome atlas (ADDAGMA) to house all publicly available, high-throughput sequencing data for the gut microbiome in domestic animals. ADDAGMA enhances the availability and accessibility of the rapidly growing body of metagenomic data. We annotated microbial and metadata from four domestic animals (cattle, horse, pig, and chicken) from 356 published papers to construct a comprehensive database that is equipped with browse and search functions, enabling users to make customized, complicated, biologically relevant queries. Users can quickly and accurately obtain experimental information on sample types, conditions, and sequencing platforms, and experimental results including microbial relative abundances, microbial taxon-associated host phenotype, and P-values for gut microbes of interest. The current version of ADDAGMA includes 290,422 quantification events (changes in abundance) for 3215 microbial taxa associated with 48 phenotypes.

35445695,A3D database: structure-based predictions of protein aggregation for the human proteome.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Protein aggregation is associated with many human disorders and constitutes a major bottleneck for producing therapeutic proteins. Our knowledge of the human protein structures repertoire has dramatically increased with the recent development of the AlphaFold (AF) deep-learning method. This structural information can be used to understand better protein aggregation properties and the rational design of protein solubility. This article uses the Aggrescan3D (A3D) tool to compute the structure-based aggregation predictions for the human proteome and make the predictions available in a database form. In the A3D database, we analyze the AF-predicted human protein structures (for over 20.5 thousand unique Uniprot IDs) in terms of their aggregation properties using the A3D tool. Each entry of the A3D database provides a detailed analysis of the structure-based aggregation propensity computed with A3D. The A3D database implements simple but useful graphical tools for visualizing and interpreting protein structure datasets. It also enables testing the influence of user-selected mutations on protein solubility and stability, all integrated into a user-friendly interface.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A3D database is freely available at: http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D2/hproteome.

35124170,The Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas: A searchable comparative transcriptome database for healthy and diseased human eye tissue.,"The applications of deep sequencing technologies in life science research and clinical diagnostics have increased rapidly over the last decade. Although fast algorithms for data processing exist, intuitive, portable solutions for data analysis are still rare. For this purpose, we developed a web-based transcriptome database, which provides a platform-independent, intuitive solution to easily explore and compare ocular gene expression of 100 diseased and healthy human tissue samples from 15 different tissue types collected at the Eye Center of the University of Freiburg. To ensure comparability of expression between different tissues, reads were normalized across all 100 samples. Differentially expressed genes were calculated between each tissue type to determine tissue-specific genes. Unsupervised analysis of all 100 samples revealed an accurate clustering according to different tissue types and a high tissue specificity by analyzing known tissue-specific marker genes. Bioinformatic cell type deconvolution using xCell provided detailed insights into the cellular profiles of each tissue type. Several new tissue-specific marker genes were identified. These genes were involved in tissue- or disease-specific processes, such as myelination for the optic nerve, visual perception for retina, keratinocyte differentiation for conjunctival carcinoma, as well as endothelial cell migration for choroidal neovascularization membranes. The results are accessible at the Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas website at https://www.eye-transcriptome.com.

37130913,STAGEs: A web-based tool that integrates data visualization and pathway enrichment analysis for gene expression studies.,"Gene expression profiling has helped tremendously in the understanding of biological processes and diseases. However, interpreting processed data to gain insights into biological mechanisms remain challenging, especially to the non-bioinformaticians, as many of these data visualization and pathway analysis tools require extensive data formatting. To circumvent these challenges, we developed STAGEs (Static and Temporal Analysis of Gene Expression studies) that provides an interactive visualisation of omics analysis outputs. Users can directly upload data created from Excel spreadsheets and use STAGEs to render volcano plots, differentially expressed genes stacked bar charts, pathway enrichment analysis by Enrichr and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) against established pathway databases or customized gene sets, clustergrams and correlation matrices. Moreover, STAGEs takes care of Excel gene to date misconversions, ensuring that every gene is considered for pathway analysis. Output data tables and graphs can be exported, and users can easily customize individual graphs using widgets such as sliders, drop-down menus, text boxes and radio buttons. Collectively, STAGEs is an integrative platform for data analysis, data visualisation and pathway analysis, and is freely available at https://kuanrongchan-stages-stages-vpgh46.streamlitapp.com/ .

34432052,3'aQTL-atlas: an atlas of 3'UTR alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci across human normal tissues.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human traits and diseases. However, functional interpretation of these SNPs remains a significant challenge. Our recent study established the concept of 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3'aQTLs), which can be used to interpret ∼16.1% of GWAS SNPs and are distinct from gene expression QTLs and splicing QTLs. Despite the growing interest in 3'aQTLs, there is no comprehensive database for users to search and visualize them across human normal tissues. In the 3'aQTL-atlas (https://wlcb.oit.uci.edu/3aQTLatlas), we provide a comprehensive list of 3'aQTLs containing ∼1.49 million SNPs associated with APA of target genes, based on 15,201 RNA-seq samples across 49 human Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v8) tissues isolated from 838 individuals. The 3'aQTL-atlas provides a ∼2-fold increase in sample size compared with our published study. It also includes 3'aQTL searches by Gene/SNP across tissues, a 3'aQTL genome browser, 3'aQTL boxplots, and GWAS-3'aQTL colocalization event visualization.

37114803,The landscape of health disparities in the UK Biobank.,"The UK Biobank (UKB), a large-scale biomedical database that includes demographic and electronic health record data for more than half a million ethnically diverse participants, is a potentially valuable resource for the study of health disparities. However, publicly accessible databases that catalog health disparities in the UKB do not exist. We developed the UKB Health Disparities Browser with the aims of (i) facilitating the exploration of the landscape of health disparities in the UK and (ii) directing the attention to areas of disparities research that might have the greatest public health impact. Health disparities were characterized for UKB participant groups defined by age, country of residence, ethnic group, sex and socioeconomic deprivation. We defined disease cohorts for UKB participants by mapping participant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes to phenotype codes (phecodes). For each of the population attributes used to define population groups, disease percent prevalence values were computed for all groups from phecode case-control cohorts, and the magnitude of the disparities was calculated by both the difference and ratio of the range of disease prevalence values among groups to identify high- and low-prevalence disparities. We identified numerous diseases and health conditions with disparate prevalence values across population attributes, and we deployed an interactive web browser to visualize the results of our analysis: https://ukbatlas.health-disparities.org. The interactive browser includes overall and group-specific prevalence data for 1513 diseases based on a cohort of >500 000 participants from the UKB.

Owing to its high disease significance, there is growing interest in investigating proteolysis on the proteome scale, termed degradomics. We developed 'Database of Identified Cleavage sites Endemic to Disease states' (DICED; https://diced.lerner.ccf.org/), as a searchable knowledgebase to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing in degradomics. DICED was designed and constructed using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and PostgreSQL. Django (https://www.djangoproject.com) was chosen as the primary framework for its security features and support for agile development. DICED can be utilized on major web browsers and operating systems for easy access to high-throughput mass spectrometry-identified cleaved protein termini. The data was obtained using N-terminomics, comprising N-terminal protein labeling, labeled peptide enrichment, mass spectrometry and positional peptide annotation. The DICED database contains experimentally derived N-terminomics peptide datasets from tissues, diseases, or digests of tissue protein libraries using individual proteases and is searchable using UniProt ID, protein name, gene symbol or up to 100 peptide sequences.

These transposable elements participate in the structure and evolution of genes and genomes through their mobility and their copy number amplification. For example, they are commonly used as evolutionary markers in genetic, genomic, and cytogenetic approaches. However, the plant research community is faced with the near absence of free availability of full-length, curated, and lineage-level classified LTR retrotransposon reference sequences. In this chapter, we will introduce InpactorDB, an LTR retrotransposon sequence database of 181 plant species representing 98 plant families for a total of 67,241 non-redundant elements.

37181487,The HRA Organ Gallery affords immersive superpowers for building and exploring the Human Reference Atlas with virtual reality.,"The Human Reference Atlas (HRA, https://humanatlas.io) funded by the NIH Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP, https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap) and other projects engages 17 international consortia to create a spatial reference of the healthy adult human body at single-cell resolution. The specimen, biological structure, and spatial data that define the HRA are disparate in nature and benefit from a visually explicit method of data integration. Virtual reality (VR) offers unique means to enable users to explore complex data structures in a three-dimensional (3D) immersive environment. On a 2D desktop application, the 3D spatiality and real-world size of the 3D reference organs of the atlas is hard to understand. If viewed in VR, the spatiality of the organs and tissue blocks mapped to the HRA can be explored in their true size and in a way that goes beyond traditional 2D user interfaces. Added 2D and 3D visualizations can then provide data-rich context. In this paper, we present the HRA Organ Gallery, a VR application to explore the atlas in an integrated VR environment. Presently, the HRA Organ Gallery features 55 3D reference organs, 1,203 mapped tissue blocks from 292 demographically diverse donors and 15 providers that link to 6,000+ datasets; it also features prototype visualizations of cell type distributions and 3D protein structures.

Missense3D analyses the effect of a missense variant on a single structure and thus may fail to identify as damaging surface variants disrupting a protein interface i.e., a protein-protein interaction (PPI) site. Here we present Missense3D-PPI designed to predict missense variants at PPI interfaces. Our development dataset comprised of 1,279 missense variants (pathogenic n = 733, benign n = 546) in 434 proteins and 545 experimental structures of PPI complexes. Benchmarking of Missense3D-PPI was performed after dividing the dataset in training (320 benign and 320 pathogenic variants) and testing (226 benign and 413 pathogenic). Structural features affecting PPI, such as disruption of interchain bonds and introduction of unbalanced charged interface residues, were analysed to assess the impact of the variant at PPI. The performance of Missense3D-PPI was superior to that of Missense3D: sensitivity 44 % versus 8% and accuracy 58% versus 40%, p = 4.23 × 10<sup>-16</sup>. However, the specificity of Missense3D-PPI was lower compared to Missense3D (84% versus 98%).

37695921,The antimicrobial peptide database is 20 years old: Recent developments and future directions.,"In 2023, the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (currently available at https://aps.unmc.edu) is 20-years-old. The timeline for the APD expansion in peptide entries, classification methods, search functions, post-translational modifications, binding targets, and mechanisms of action of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been summarized in our previous Protein Science paper. This article highlights new database additions and findings. To facilitate antimicrobial development to combat drug-resistant pathogens, the APD has been re-annotating the data for antibacterial activity (active, inactive, and uncertain), toxicity (hemolytic and nonhemolytic AMPs), and salt tolerance (salt sensitive and insensitive). Comparison of the respective desired and undesired AMP groups produces new knowledge for peptide design. Our unification of AMPs from the six life kingdoms into ""natural AMPs"" enabled the first comparison with globular or transmembrane proteins. Due to the dominance of amphipathic helical and disulfide-linked peptides, cysteine, glycine, and lysine in natural AMPs are much more abundant than those in globular proteins. To include peptides predicted by machine learning, a new ""predicted"" group has been created. Remarkably, the averaged amino acid composition of predicted peptides is located between the lower bound of natural AMPs and the upper bound of synthetic peptides. Synthetic peptides in the current APD, with the highest cationic and hydrophobic amino acid percentages, are mostly designed with varying degrees of optimization. Hence, natural AMPs accumulated in the APD over 20 years have laid the foundation for machine learning prediction. We discuss future directions for peptide discovery.

Efficient lesion segmentation can speed up these radiological workflows. While numerous benchmarks and challenges address lesion segmentation in specific organs like the liver, kidneys, and lungs, the larger variety of lesion types encountered in clinical practice demands a more universal approach. To address this gap, we introduced the ULS23 benchmark for 3D universal lesion segmentation in chest-abdomen-pelvis CT examinations. The ULS23 training dataset contains 38,693 lesions across this region, including challenging pancreatic, colon and bone lesions. For evaluation purposes, we curated a dataset comprising 775 lesions from 284 patients. Each of these lesions was identified as a target lesion in a clinical context, ensuring diversity and clinical relevance within this dataset. The ULS23 benchmark is publicly accessible at https://uls23.grand-challenge.org, enabling researchers worldwide to assess the performance of their segmentation methods. Furthermore, we have developed and publicly released our baseline semi-supervised 3D lesion segmentation model.

However, the widespread use of small-molecule compounds that are claimed as chemical probes but are lacking sufficient quality, especially being inadequately selective for the desired target or even broadly promiscuous in behaviour, has resulted in many erroneous conclusions in the biomedical literature. The Chemical Probes Portal was established as a public resource to aid the selection and best-practice use of chemical probes in basic and translational biomedical research. We describe the background, principles and content of the Portal and its technical development, as well as examples of its applications and use.

36896476,IGTCM: An integrative genome database of traditional Chinese medicine plants.,"Fully understanding traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) is still challenging because of the extreme complexity of their chemical components and mechanisms of action. The TCM Plant Genome Project aimed to obtain genetic information, determine gene functions, discover regulatory networks of herbal species, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease prevention and treatment, thereby accelerating the modernization of TCMs. A comprehensive database that contains TCM-related information will provide a vital resource. Here, we present an integrative genome database of TCM plants (IGTCM) that contains 14,711,220 records of 83 annotated TCM-related herb genomes, including 3,610,350 genes, 3,534,314 proteins and corresponding coding sequences, and 4,032,242 RNAs, as well as 1033 non-redundant component records for 68 herbs, downloaded and integrated from the GenBank and RefSeq databases. For minimal interconnectivity, each gene, protein, and component was annotated using the eggNOG-mapper tool and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database to acquire pathway information and enzyme classifications. These features can be linked across several species and different components. The IGTCM database also provides visualization and sequence similarity search tools for data analyses. These annotated herb genome sequences in IGTCM database are a necessary resource for systematically exploring genes related to the biosynthesis of compounds that have significant medicinal activities and excellent agronomic traits that can be used to improve TCM-related varieties through molecular breeding.

Its primary focus is integrating experimental gene function information from the peer-reviewed literature and codifying it as controlled vocabulary annotations. Our goal is to produce a ""gold standard"" functional annotation set that reflects the current state of knowledge about the Arabidopsis genome. At the same time, the resource serves as a nexus for community-based collaborations aimed at improving data quality, access, and reuse. For the past decade, our work has been made possible by subscriptions from our global user base. This update covers our ongoing biocuration work, some of our modernization efforts that contribute to the first major infrastructure overhaul since 2011, the introduction of JBrowse2, and the resource's role in community activities such as organizing the structural reannotation of the genome. For gene function assessment, we used gene ontology annotations as a metric to evaluate: (1) what is currently known about Arabidopsis gene function and (2) the set of ""unknown"" genes. Currently, 74% of the proteome has been annotated to at least one gene ontology term. Of those loci, half have experimental support for at least one of the following aspects: molecular function, biological process, or cellular component. Our work sheds light on the genes for which we have not yet identified any published experimental data and have no functional annotation.

36006844,CPMCP: a database of Chinese patent medicine and compound prescription.,"Although several traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-related databases have emerged, they focus on researching single medicinal materials, which is far from sufficient for clinical research and application. In comparison, compound prescriptions are more informative and meaningful in TCM, for they embody the information on the compatibility of TCM besides the relatively isolated information about single medicinal materials. The compatibility information is essential in TCM because it conveys not only what components are involved to treat special diseases but also how to combine these single medical materials. We established a database of Chinese patent medicine and compound prescription (CPMCP). It demonstrates the prescription information of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) and ancient Chinese medicine prescriptions (CMPs). CPMCP reports their comprehensive and standardized information such as the components, indications and contraindications. It is worth mentioning that we organized relevant experts and spent lots of time manually mapping the functions of compound prescriptions in ancient Chinese to the standardized TCM symptom vocabularies, obtaining a total of 71 414 associations between compound prescriptions and TCM symptoms. In this way, CPMCP established the associations between TCM and modern medicine (MM) according to the associations between TCM symptoms and MM symptoms. In addition, to further exhibit the compatibility mechanism of compound prescriptions, CPMCP summarizes a set of common drug combination principles by analyzing the existing prescriptions. We believe that CPMCP can promote the modernization of TCM and make greater contributions to MM.

39497074,GPCR-BSD: a database of binding sites of human G-protein coupled receptors under diverse states.,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of membrane proteins in human body, involve a great variety of biological processes and thus have become highly valuable drug targets. By binding with ligands (e.g., drugs), GPCRs switch between active and inactive conformational states, thereby performing functions such as signal transmission. The changes in binding pockets under different states are important for a better understanding of drug-target interactions. Therefore it is critical, as well as a practical need, to obtain binding sites in human GPCR structures. We report a database (called GPCR-BSD) that collects 127,990 predicted binding sites of 803 GPCRs under active and inactive states (thus 1,606 structures in total). The binding sites were identified from the predicted GPCR structures by executing three geometric-based pocket prediction methods, fpocket, CavityPlus and GHECOM. The server provides query, visualization, and comparison of the predicted binding sites for both GPCR predicted and experimentally determined structures recorded in PDB. We evaluated the identified pockets of 132 experimentally determined human GPCR structures in terms of pocket residue coverage, pocket center distance and redocking accuracy. The evaluation showed that fpocket and CavityPlus methods performed better and successfully predicted orthosteric binding sites in over 60% of the 132 experimentally determined structures.

Sampling the organs from the same bodies minimizes intra-individual variability and facilitates the making of a precise high-resolution body map of the non-coding transcriptome. The data allow shedding light on the organ- and organ system-specificity of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs. As use case of our resource, we describe the identification of highly specific ncRNAs in different organs. The update also contains 58 samples from six tissues of the Tabula Muris collection, allowing to check if the tissue specificity is evolutionary conserved between Homo sapiens and Mus musculus.

39237105,Drug-Target Interactions Prediction at Scale: The Komet Algorithm with the LCIdb Dataset.,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction algorithms are used at various stages of the drug discovery process. In this context, specific problems such as deorphanization of a new therapeutic target or target identification of a drug candidate arising from phenotypic screens require large-scale predictions across the protein and molecule spaces. DTI prediction heavily relies on supervised learning algorithms that use known DTIs to learn associations between molecule and protein features, allowing for the prediction of new interactions based on learned patterns. The algorithms must be broadly applicable to enable reliable predictions, even in regions of the protein or molecule spaces where data may be scarce. In this paper, we address two key challenges to fulfill these goals: building large, high-quality training datasets and designing prediction methods that can scale, in order to be trained on such large datasets. First, we introduce LCIdb, a curated, large-sized dataset of DTIs, offering extensive coverage of both the molecule and druggable protein spaces. Notably, LCIdb contains a much higher number of molecules than publicly available benchmarks, expanding coverage of the molecule space. Second, we propose Komet (Kronecker Optimized METhod), a DTI prediction pipeline designed for scalability without compromising performance. Komet leverages a three-step framework, incorporating efficient computation choices tailored for large datasets and involving the Nyström approximation. Specifically, Komet employs a Kronecker interaction module for (molecule, protein) pairs, which efficiently captures determinants in DTIs, and whose structure allows for reduced computational complexity and quasi-Newton optimization, ensuring that the model can handle large training sets, without compromising on performance. Our method is implemented in open-source software, leveraging GPU parallel computation for efficiency. We demonstrate the interest of our pipeline on various datasets, showing that Komet displays superior scalability and prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Additionally, we illustrate the generalization properties of Komet by showing its performance on an external dataset, and on the publicly available LH benchmark designed for scaffold hopping problems.

39225545,NCI's Proteomic Data Commons: A Cloud-Based Proteomics Repository Empowering Comprehensive Cancer Analysis through Cross-Referencing with Genomic and Imaging Data.,"Proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for studying cancer biology, developing diagnostics, and therapies. With the continuous improvement and widespread availability of high-throughput proteomic technologies, the generation of large-scale proteomic data has become more common in cancer research, and there is a growing need for resources that support the sharing and integration of multi-omics datasets. Such datasets require extensive metadata including clinical, biospecimen, and experimental and workflow annotations that are crucial for data interpretation and reanalysis. The need to integrate, analyze, and share these data has led to the development of NCI's Proteomic Data Commons (PDC), accessible at https://pdc.cancer.gov. As a specialized repository within the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), PDC enables researchers to locate and analyze proteomic data from various cancer types and connect with genomic and imaging data available for the same samples in other CRDC nodes. Presently, PDC houses annotated data from more than 160 datasets across 19 cancer types, generated by several large-scale cancer research programs with cohort sizes exceeding 100 samples (tumor and associated normal when available). In this article, we review the current state of PDC in cancer research, discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with data sharing in proteomics, and propose future directions for the resource.<h4>Significance</h4>The Proteomic Data Commons (PDC) plays a crucial role in advancing cancer research by providing a centralized repository of high-quality cancer proteomic data, enriched with extensive clinical annotations.

35641682,The Mandarin Chinese auditory emotions stimulus database: A validated set of Chinese pseudo-sentences.,"Emotional prosody is fully embedded in language and can be influenced by the linguistic properties of a specific language. Considering the limitations of existing Chinese auditory stimulus database studies, we developed and validated an emotional auditory stimuli database composed of Chinese pseudo-sentences, recorded by six professional actors in Mandarin Chinese. Emotional expressions included happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, pleasant surprise, and neutrality. All emotional categories were vocalized into two types of sentence patterns, declarative and interrogative. In addition, all emotional pseudo-sentences, except for neutral, were vocalized at two levels of emotional intensity: normal and strong. Each recording was validated with 40 native Chinese listeners in terms of the recognition accuracy of the intended emotion portrayal; finally, 4361 pseudo-sentence stimuli were included in the database. Validation of the database using a forced-choice recognition paradigm revealed high rates of emotional recognition accuracy. The detailed acoustic attributes of vocalization were provided and connected to the emotion recognition rates. This corpus could be a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians to explore the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying emotion processing of the general population and emotional disturbances in neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders.

"35898309, 37676599",CARs-DB: A Database of Cryptic Amyloidogenic Regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.,"Proteome-wide analyses suggest that most globular proteins contain at least one amyloidogenic region, whereas these aggregation-prone segments are thought to be underrepresented in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In recent work, we reported that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) indeed sustain a significant amyloid load in the form of cryptic amyloidogenic regions (CARs). CARs are widespread in IDRs, but they are necessarily exposed to solvent, and thus they should be more polar and have a milder aggregation potential than conventional amyloid regions protected inside globular proteins. CARs are connected with IDPs function and, in particular, with the establishment of protein-protein interactions through their IDRs. However, their presence also appears associated with pathologies like cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Given the relevance of CARs for both IDPs function and malfunction, we developed CARs-DB, a database containing precomputed predictions for all CARs present in the IDPs deposited in the DisProt database. This web tool allows for the fast and comprehensive exploration of previously unnoticed amyloidogenic regions embedded within IDRs sequences and might turn helpful in identifying disordered interacting regions. It contains >8,900 unique CARs identified in a total of 1711 IDRs. CARs-DB is freely available for users and can be accessed at http://carsdb.ppmclab.com.

The knotting is defined in a probabilistic fashion. The knotting complexity of proteins is presented in the form of a matrix diagram which shows users the knot type for the entire polypeptide chain and for each of its subchains. The dominant knot types as well as the computed locations of the knot cores (i.e. minimal portions of protein backbones that form a given knot type) are shown for each protein structure. Based mainly on the pLDDT confidence values, entanglements are classified as Knots, Unsure, and Artifacts. The database portion of the server can be used, for example, to examine protein geometry and entanglement-function correlations, as a reference set for protein modeling, and for facilitating evolutional studies.

To date, COVID-19 remains a life-threatening pandemic with little to no targeted therapeutic recourse. The discovery of novel antiviral agents, such as vaccines and drugs, can provide therapeutic solutions to save human beings from severe infections; however, there is no specifically effective antiviral treatment confirmed for now. Thus, great attention has been paid to the use of natural or artificial antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as these compounds are widely regarded as promising solutions for the treatment of harmful microorganisms. Given the biological significance of AMPs, it was obvious that there was a significant need for a single platform for identifying and engaging with AMP data. This led to the creation of the dbAMP platform that provides comprehensive information about AMPs and facilitates their investigation and analysis. To date, the dbAMP has accumulated 26 447 AMPs and 2262 antimicrobial proteins from 3044 organisms using both database integration and manual curation of >4579 articles. In addition, dbAMP facilitates the evaluation of AMP structures using I-TASSER for automated protein structure prediction and structure-based functional annotation, providing predictive structure information for clinical drug development. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing have been applied to generate large-scale sequencing reads from various environments, enabling greatly improved analysis of genome structure. In this update, we launch an efficient online tool that can effectively identify AMPs from genome/metagenome and proteome data of all species in a short period.

In recent years, the interaction between miRNAs and their target genes has become one of the mainstream directions for drug development. As a large-scale biological database that mainly provides miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) verified by biological experiments, miRTarBase has undergone five revisions and enhancements. The database has accumulated >2 200 449 verified MTIs from 13 389 manually curated articles and CLIP-seq data. An optimized scoring system is adopted to enhance this update's critical recognition of MTI-related articles and corresponding disease information. In addition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and disease-related variants related to the binding efficiency of miRNA and target were characterized in miRNAs and gene 3' untranslated regions. miRNA expression profiles across extracellular vesicles, blood and different tissues, including exosomal miRNAs and tissue-specific miRNAs, were integrated to explore miRNA functions and biomarkers. For the user interface, we have classified attributes, including RNA expression, specific interaction, protein expression and biological function, for various validation experiments related to the role of miRNA. We also used seed sequence information to evaluate the binding sites of miRNA.

35487995,ImitateDB: A database for domain and motif mimicry incorporating host and pathogen protein interactions.,"Molecular mimicry of host proteins by pathogens constitutes a strategy to hijack the host pathways. At present, there is no dedicated resource for mimicked domains and motifs in the host-pathogen interactome. In this work, the experimental host-pathogen (HP) and host-host (HH) protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were collated. The domains and motifs of these proteins were annotated using CD Search and ScanProsite, respectively. Host and pathogen proteins with a shared host interactor and similar domain/motif constitute a mimicry pair exhibiting global structural similarity (domain mimicry pair; DMP) or local sequence motif similarity (motif mimicry pair; MMP). Mimicry pairs are likely to be co-expressed and co-localized. 1,97,607 DMPs and 32,67,568 MMPs were identified in 49,265 experimental HP-PPIs and organized in a web-based resource, ImitateDB ( http://imitatedb.sblab-nsit.net ) that can be easily queried. The results are externally integrated using hyperlinked domain PSSM ID, motif ID, protein ID and PubMed ID.

36913438,dbAQP-SNP: a database of missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human aquaporins.,"Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins belong to the superfamily of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), and they transport water and other neutral solutes such as glycerol. These channel proteins are involved in vital physiological processes and are implicated in several human diseases. Experimentally determined structures of MIPs from diverse organisms reveal a unique hour-glass fold with six transmembrane helices and two half-helices. MIP channels have two constrictions formed by Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs and aromatic/arginine selectivity filters (Ar/R SFs). Several reports have found associations among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human aquaporins (AQPs) with diseases in specific populations. In this study, we have compiled 2798 SNPs that give rise to missense mutations in 13 human AQPs. To understand the nature of missense substitutions, we have systematically analyzed the pattern of substitutions. We found several examples in which substitutions could be considered as non-conservative that include small to big or hydrophobic to charged residues. We also analyzed these substitutions in the context of structure. We have identified SNPs that occur in NPA motifs or Ar/R SFs, and they will most certainly disrupt the structure and/or transport properties of human AQPs. We found 22 examples in which missense SNP substitutions that are mostly non-conservative in nature have given rise to pathogenic conditions as found in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. It is most likely that not all missense SNPs in human AQPs will result in diseases. However, understanding the effect of missense SNPs on the structure and function of human AQPs is important. In this direction, we have developed a database dbAQP-SNP that contains information about all 2798 SNPs. This database has several features and search options that can help the user to find SNPs in specific positions of human AQPs including the functionally and/or structurally important regions. dbAQP-SNP (http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/dbAQP-SNP) is freely available to the academic community.

37142846,A network map of macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) signaling.,"Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), a serum-derived growth factor belonging to the plasminogen-related kringle domain family, is mainly produced by the liver and released into the blood. MSP is the only known ligand for RON (""Recepteur d'Origine Nantais"", also known as MST1R), which is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. MSP is associated with many pathological conditions, including cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. Activation of the MSP/RON system regulates main downstream signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ AKT serine/threonine kinase/ (PI3-K/AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) & Focal adhesion kinase (FAK). These pathways are mainly involved in cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, angiogenesis & chemoresistance. In this work, we created a pathway resource of signaling events mediated by MSP/RON considering its contribution to diseases. We provide an integrated pathway reaction map of MSP/RON that is composed of 113 proteins and 26 reactions based on the curation of data from the published literature.

Researchers have gradually revealed that RNA modifications, especially N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which is one of the most abundant and commonly studied RNA modifications in plants, have important roles in physiological and pathological processes. These modifications alter the structure of RNA, which affects its molecular complementarity and binding to specific proteins, thereby resulting in various of physiological effects. The increasing interest in plant RNA modifications has necessitated research into RNA modifications and associated datasets.

37093842,"MTSviewer: A database to visualize mitochondrial targeting sequences, cleavage sites, and mutations on protein structures.","Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a wide array of human diseases ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to cardiovascular defects. The coordinated localization and import of proteins into mitochondria are essential processes that ensure mitochondrial homeostasis. The localization and import of most mitochondrial proteins are driven by N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS's), which interact with import machinery and are removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). The recent discovery of internal MTS's-those which are distributed throughout a protein and act as import regulators or secondary MPP cleavage sites-has expanded the role of both MTS's and MPP beyond conventional N-terminal regulatory pathways. Still, the global mutational landscape of MTS's remains poorly characterized, both from genetic and structural perspectives. To this end, we have integrated a variety of tools into one harmonized R/Shiny database called MTSviewer (https://neurobioinfo.github.io/MTSvieweR/), which combines MTS predictions, cleavage sites, genetic variants, pathogenicity predictions, and N-terminomics data with structural visualization using AlphaFold models of human and yeast mitochondrial proteomes.

38748636,PMBC: a manually curated database for prognostic markers of breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is notorious for its high mortality and heterogeneity, resulting in different therapeutic responses. Classical biomarkers have been identified and successfully commercially applied to predict the outcome of breast cancer patients. Accumulating biomarkers, including non-coding RNAs, have been reported as prognostic markers for breast cancer with the development of sequencing techniques. However, there are currently no databases dedicated to the curation and characterization of prognostic markers for breast cancer. Therefore, we constructed a curated database for prognostic markers of breast cancer (PMBC). PMBC consists of 1070 markers covering mRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs and circRNAs. These markers are enriched in various cancer- and epithelial-related functions including mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling. We mapped the prognostic markers into the ceRNA network from starBase. The lncRNA NEAT1 competes with 11 RNAs, including lncRNAs and mRNAs. The majority of the ceRNAs in ABAT belong to pseudogenes. The topology analysis of the ceRNA network reveals that known prognostic RNAs have higher closeness than random. Among all the biomarkers, prognostic lncRNAs have a higher degree, while prognostic mRNAs have significantly higher closeness than random RNAs. These results indicate that the lncRNAs play important roles in maintaining the interactions between lncRNAs and their ceRNAs, which might be used as a characteristic to prioritize prognostic lncRNAs based on the ceRNA network. PMBC renders a user-friendly interface and provides detailed information about individual prognostic markers, which will facilitate the precision treatment of breast cancer.

However, most existing tools and resources focus only on ligand-receptor interaction pairs where both partners are proteinaceous, neglecting other non-protein molecules. To address this gap, we introduce the MRCLinkdb database and algorithm, which aggregates and organizes data related to non-protein L-R interactions in cell-cell communication, providing a valuable resource for predicting intercellular communication based on metabolite-related ligand-receptor interactions.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we manually curated the metabolite-ligand-receptor (ML-R) interactions from the literature and known databases, ultimately collecting over 790 human and 670 mouse ML-R interactions. Additionally, we compiled information on over 1900 enzymes and 260 transporter entries associated with these metabolites. We developed Metabolite-Receptor based Cell Link Database (MRCLinkdb) to store these ML-R interactions data. Meanwhile, the platform also offers extensive information for presenting ML-R interactions, including fundamental metabolite information and the overall expression landscape of metabolite-associated gene sets (such as receptor, enzymes, and transporter proteins) based on single-cell transcriptomics sequencing (covering 35 human and 26 mouse tissues, 52 human and 44 mouse cell types) and bulk RNA-seq/microarray data (encompassing 62 human and 39 mouse tissues). Furthermore, MRCLinkdb introduces a web server dedicated to the analysis of intercellular communication based on ML-R interactions.

37831137,mHapBrowser: a comprehensive database for visualization and analysis of DNA methylation haplotypes.,"DNA methylation acts as a vital epigenetic regulatory mechanism involved in controlling gene expression. Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled characterization of methylation patterns at single-base resolution using bisulfite sequencing approaches. However, existing methylation databases have primarily focused on mean methylation levels, overlooking phased methylation patterns. The methylation status of CpGs on individual sequencing reads represents discrete DNA methylation haplotypes (mHaps). Here, we present mHapBrowser, a comprehensive database for visualizing and analyzing mHaps. We systematically processed data of diverse tissues in human, mouse and rat from public repositories, generating mHap format files for 6366 samples. mHapBrowser enables users to visualize eight mHap metrics across the genome through an integrated WashU Epigenome Browser. It also provides an online server for comparing mHap patterns across samples. Additionally, mHap files for all samples can be downloaded to facilitate local processing using downstream analysis toolkits. The utilities of mHapBrowser were demonstrated through three case studies: (i) mHap patterns are associated with gene expression; (ii) changes in mHap patterns independent of mean methylation correlate with differential expression between lung cancer subtypes; and (iii) the mHap metric MHL outperforms mean methylation for classifying tumor and normal samples from cell-free DNA.

40272360,invertiaDB: a database of inverted repeats across organismal genomes.,"Inverted repeats are repetitive elements that can form hairpin and cruciform structures. They are linked to genomic instability; however, they also have various biological functions. Their distribution differs markedly across taxonomic groups in the tree of life, and they exhibit high polymorphism due to their inherent genomic instability. Advances in sequencing technologies and declined costs have enabled the generation of an ever-growing number of complete genomes for organisms across taxonomic groups in the tree of life. However, a comprehensive database encompassing inverted repeats across diverse organismal genomes has been lacking. We present invertiaDB, the first comprehensive database of inverted repeats spanning multiple taxa, featuring repeats identified in the genomes of 118 101 organisms across all major taxonomic groups.

In this 10th release and 20th-anniversary update, the CORE collection has expanded with 329 new profiles. We updated three existing profiles and provided orthogonal support for 72 profiles from the previous release's UNVALIDATED collection. Altogether, the JASPAR 2024 update provides a 20% increase in CORE profiles from the previous release. A trimming algorithm enhanced profiles by removing low information content flanking base pairs, which were likely uninformative (within the capacity of the PFM models) for TFBS predictions and modelling TF-DNA interactions. This release includes enhanced metadata, featuring a refined classification for plant TFs' structural DNA-binding domains.

However, despite the existence of reliable sources for extricating this data, it remains a challenge to accurately comprehend and draw conclusions based on the entirety of available information. Therefore, the current study aimed to design and develop a database for the identified variants of 5 different cancer types using 20 different cancer exomes. The exome data were retrieved from NCBI SRA and an NGS data clean-up protocol was implemented to obtain the best quality reads. The reads which passed the quality checks were then used for calling the variants which were then processed and filtered. This data was used to normalize and the normalized data generated was used for developing the database. MutaXome, which stands for mutations in cancer exome was designed in SQL, with the front end in bootstrap and HTML, and backend in PHP.

38011719,aSynPEP-DB: a database of biogenic peptides for inhibiting α-synuclein aggregation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, yet effective treatments able to stop or delay disease progression remain elusive. The aggregation of a presynaptic protein, α-synuclein (aSyn), is the primary neurological hallmark of PD and, thus, a promising target for therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of consensus on the molecular properties required to specifically bind the toxic species formed during aSyn aggregation has hindered the development of therapeutic molecules. Recently, we defined and experimentally validated a peptide architecture that demonstrated high affinity and selectivity in binding to aSyn toxic oligomers and fibrils, effectively preventing aSyn pathogenic aggregation. Human peptides with such properties may have neuroprotective activities and hold a huge therapeutic interest. Driven by this idea, here, we developed a discriminative algorithm for the screening of human endogenous neuropeptides, antimicrobial peptides and diet-derived bioactive peptides with the potential to inhibit aSyn aggregation. We identified over 100 unique biogenic peptide candidates and ensembled a comprehensive database (aSynPEP-DB) that collects their physicochemical features, source datasets and additional therapeutic-relevant information, including their sites of expression and associated pathways. Besides, we provide access to the discriminative algorithm to extend its application to the screening of artificial peptides or new peptide datasets. aSynPEP-DB is a unique repository of peptides with the potential to modulate aSyn aggregation, serving as a platform for the identification of previously unexplored therapeutic agents.

38994794,DrugRepoBank: a comprehensive database and discovery platform for accelerating drug repositioning.,"In recent years, drug repositioning has emerged as a promising alternative to the time-consuming, expensive and risky process of developing new drugs for diseases. However, the current database for drug repositioning faces several issues, including insufficient data volume, restricted data types, algorithm inaccuracies resulting from the neglect of multidimensional or heterogeneous data, a lack of systematic organization of literature data associated with drug repositioning, limited analytical capabilities and user-unfriendly webpage interfaces. Hence, we have established the first all-encompassing database called DrugRepoBank, consisting of two main modules: the 'Literature' module and the 'Prediction' module. The 'Literature' module serves as the largest repository of literature-supported drug repositioning data with experimental evidence, encompassing 169 repositioned drugs from 134 articles from 1 January 2000 to 1 July 2023. The 'Prediction' module employs 18 efficient algorithms, including similarity-based, artificial-intelligence-based, signature-based and network-based methods to predict repositioned drug candidates. The DrugRepoBank features an interactive and user-friendly web interface and offers comprehensive functionalities such as bioinformatics analysis of disease signatures. When users provide information about a drug, target or disease of interest, DrugRepoBank offers new indications and targets for the drug, proposes new drugs that bind to the target or suggests potential drugs for the queried disease. Additionally, it provides basic information about drugs, targets or diseases, along with supporting literature. We utilize three case studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of predictively repositioned drugs within DrugRepoBank. The establishment of the DrugRepoBank database will significantly accelerate the pace of drug repositioning.

39961523,CAZyme3D: A Database of 3D Structures for Carbohydrate-active Enzymes.,"CAZymes (Carbohydrate Active EnZymes) degrade, synthesize, and modify all complex carbohydrates on Earth. CAZymes are extremely important to research in human health, nutrition, gut microbiome, bioenergy, plant disease, and global carbon recycling. Current CAZyme annotation tools are all based on sequence similarity. A more powerful approach is to detect protein structural similarity between query proteins and known CAZymes indicative of distant homology. Here, we developed CAZyme3D (https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/) to fill the research gap that no dedicated 3D structure databases are currently available for CAZymes. CAZyme3D contains a total of 870,740 AlphaFold predicted 3D structures (named Whole dataset). A subset of CAZymes 3D structures from 188,574 nonredundant sequences (named ID50 dataset) were subject to structural similarity-based clustering analyses. Such clustering allowed us to organize all CAZyme structures using a hierarchical classification, which includes existing levels defined by the CAZy database (class, clan, family, subfamily) and newly defined levels (subclasses, structural cluster [SC] groups, and SCs). The inter-family structural clustering successfully grouped CAZy families and clans with the same structural folds in the same subclasses. The intra-family structural clustering classified structurally similar CAZymes into SCs, which were further classified into SC groups. SCs and SC groups differed from sequence similarity-based CAZy subfamilies. With CAZyme structures as the search database, we created job submission pages, where users can submit query protein sequences or PDB structures for a structural similarity search. CAZyme3D will be a useful new tool to assist the discovery of novel CAZymes by providing a comprehensive database of CAZyme 3D structures.",True,False,4.0,,cazyme3d,cazy,16.0,conflict,,alphafold,pdb,spacy,0.0,CAZyme3D,True,5.0,True,True,https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/,https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/,True,"...of distant homology.

Consequently, huge amounts of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data concerning cotton species have been generated and released. These large-scale data provide immense opportunities for the study of cotton genomic structure and evolution, population genetic diversity and genome-wide mining of excellent genes for important traits. However, the complexity of NGS data also causes distress, as it cannot be utilized easily. Here, we presented the cotton omics data platform COTTONOMICS (http://cotton.zju.edu.cn/), an easily accessible web database that integrates 32.5 TB of omics data including seven assembled genomes, resequencing data from 1180 allotetraploid cotton accessions and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), small RNA-sequencing (smRNA-seq), Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), DNase hypersensitive sites sequencing (DNase-seq) and Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). COTTONOMICS allows users to employ various search scenarios and retrieve information concerning the cotton genomes, genomic variation (Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Insertion and Deletion (InDels)), gene expression, smRNA expression, epigenetic regulation and quantitative trait locus (QTLs).

34718689,ARTS-DB: a database for antibiotic resistant targets.,"As a result of the continuous evolution of drug resistant bacteria, new antibiotics are urgently needed. Encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), antibiotic compounds are mostly produced by bacteria. With the exponential increase in the number of publicly available, sequenced genomes and the advancements of BGC prediction tools, genome mining algorithms have uncovered millions of uncharacterized BGCs for further evaluation. Since compound identification and characterization remain bottlenecks, a major challenge is prioritizing promising BGCs. Recently, researchers adopted self-resistance based strategies allowing them to predict the biological activities of natural products encoded by uncharacterized BGCs. Since 2017, the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) facilitated this so-called target-directed genome mining (TDGM) approach for the prioritization of BGCs encoding potentially novel antibiotics. Here, we present the ARTS database, available at https://arts-db.ziemertlab.com/. The ARTS database provides pre-computed ARTS results for >70,000 genomes and metagenome assembled genomes in total.

34718696,Proteome-pI 2.0: proteome isoelectric point database update.,"Proteome-pI 2.0 is an update of an online database containing predicted isoelectric points and pKa dissociation constants of proteins and peptides. The isoelectric point-the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge-is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques. Additionally, it can be obtained directly from the pKa values of individual charged residues of the protein. The Proteome-pI 2.0 database includes data for over 61 million protein sequences from 20 115 proteomes (three to four times more than the previous release). The isoelectric point for proteins is predicted by 21 methods, whereas pKa values are inferred by one method. To facilitate bottom-up proteomics analysis, individual proteomes were digested in silico with the five most commonly used proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, trypsin + LysC, LysN, ArgC), and the peptides' isoelectric point and molecular weights were calculated. The database enables the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and customized fractions of a proteome based on the isoelectric point and molecular weight. In addition, isoelectric points for proteins in NCBI non-redundant (nr), UniProt, SwissProt, and Protein Data Bank are available in both CSV and FASTA formats.

35685362,dbEssLnc: A manually curated database of human and mouse essential lncRNA genes.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes. Knocking out or knocking down some lncRNAs will lead to lethality or infertility. These lncRNAs are called essential lncRNAs. Knowledges of essential lncRNAs are important in establishing minimal genomes of living cells, developing drug therapies and early diagnostic approaches for complex diseases. However, existing databases focus on collecting essential coding genes. Essential non-coding gene records are rare in existing databases. A comprehensive collection of essential non-coding genes, particularly essential lncRNA genes, is demanded. We manually curated 207 essential lncRNAs from literatures for establishing a database on essential lncRNAs, which is named as dbEssLnc (Database of essential lncRNAs).

This has been fuelled by interest in the central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions and host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a database of known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper reports the release of a new version of the database which includes a full RESTful application programming interface (API), a new website framework, and an expanded database that includes 8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552. In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from both NP Classifier and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a dashboard for taxonomic origin.

34718712,PCMDB: a curated and comprehensive resource of plant cell markers.,"The advent of single-cell sequencing opened a new era in transcriptomic and genomic research. To understand cell composition using single-cell studies, a variety of cell markers have been widely used to label individual cell types. However, the specific database of cell markers for use by the plant research community remains very limited. To overcome this problem, we developed the Plant Cell Marker DataBase (PCMDB, http://www.tobaccodb.org/pcmdb/), which is based on a uniform annotation pipeline. By manually curating over 130 000 research publications, we collected a total of 81 117 cell marker genes of 263 cell types in 22 tissues across six plant species. Tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns can be visualized using multiple tools: eFP Browser, Bar, and UMAP/TSNE graph. The PCMDB also supports several analysis tools, including SCSA and SingleR, which allows for user annotation of cell types. To provide information about plant species currently unsupported in PCMDB, potential marker genes for other plant species can be searched based on homology with the supported species. PCMDB is a user-friendly hierarchical platform that contains five built-in search engines.

The recent explosion of research in the area still lacks tools for the analysis and data integration among different repositories. Currently, there is not a comprehensive and dedicated database that collects all disease-related variations in combination with the protein location, biological role in the MLO, and all the metadata available for each protein and disease. Disease-related protein variants and additional features are dispersed and the user has to navigate many databases, with a different focus, formats, and often not user friendly.<h4>Results</h4>We present DisPhaseDB, a database dedicated to disease-related variants of liquid-liquid phase separation proteins. It integrates 10 databases, contains 5,741 proteins, 1,660,059 variants, and 4,051 disease terms. It also offers intuitive navigation and an informative display.

However, to date, there is a lack of corresponding online resources to utilize these valuable data to study gene expression dysregulation and viral infection, two major causes for cancer development and progression. To address these unmet needs, we established OncoDB, an online database resource to explore abnormal patterns in gene expression as well as viral infection that are correlated to clinical features in cancer. Specifically, OncoDB integrated RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and related clinical data from over 10 000 cancer patients in the TCGA study as well as from normal tissues in the GTEx study. Another unique aspect of OncoDB is its focus on oncoviruses. By mining TCGA RNA-seq data, we have identified six major oncoviruses across cancer types and further correlated viral infection to changes in host gene expression and clinical outcomes. All the analysis results are integratively presented in OncoDB with a flexible web interface to search for data related to RNA expression, DNA methylation, viral infection, and clinical features of the cancer patients.

Improved understandings of the phenotypic changes of immune cells during sepsis and the driving molecular mechanisms are critical to the elucidation of sepsis pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which interprets transcriptome at a single-cell resolution, serves as a useful tool to uncover disease-related gene expression signatures of different cell populations in various diseases. It has also been applied to studies on sepsis immunopathological mechanisms. Due to the fact that most sepsis-related studies utilizing scRNA-seq have very small sample sizes and there is a lack of an scRNA-seq database for sepsis, we developed Sepsis Single-cell Whole Gene Expression Database Website (SC2sepsis) (http://www.rjh-sc2sepsis.com/), integrating scRNA-seq datasets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 septic patients and 26 healthy controls, with a total amount of 232 226 cells.

However, the functional assignment for the vast majority of the identified phosphosites remains a major challenge. Here, we provide a deep learning framework named FuncPhos-STR as an online resource, for functional prediction and structural visualization of human proteome-level phosphosites. Based on our reported FuncPhos-SEQ framework, which was built by integrating phosphosite sequence evolution and protein-protein interaction (PPI) information, FuncPhos-STR was developed by further integrating the structural and dynamics information on AlphaFold protein structures.

38470883,AagingBase: a comprehensive database of anti-aging peptides.,"The process of aging is an intrinsic and inevitable aspect of life that impacts every living organism. As biotechnological advancements continue to shape our understanding of medicine, peptide therapeutics have emerged as a promising strategy for anti-aging interventions. This is primarily due to their favorable attributes, such as low immunogenicity and cost-effective production. Peptide-based treatments have garnered widespread acceptance and interest in aging research, particularly in the context of age-related therapies. To effectively develop anti-aging treatments, a comprehensive understanding of the physicochemical characteristics of anti-aging peptides is essential. Factors such as amino acid composition, instability index, hydrophobic areas and other relevant properties significantly determine their efficacy as potential therapeutic agents. Consequently, the creation of 'AagingBase', a comprehensive database for anti-aging peptides, aims to facilitate research on aging by leveraging the potential of peptide therapies. AagingBase houses experimentally validated 282 anti-aging peptides collected from 54 research articles and 236 patents. Employing state-of-the-art computational techniques, the acquired sequences have undergone rigorous physicochemical calculations. Furthermore, AagingBase presents users with various informative analyses highlighting atomic compositions, secondary structure fractions, tertiary structure, amino acid compositions and frequencies. The database also offers advanced search and filtering options and similarity search, thereby aiding researchers in understanding their biological functions.

However, the application of GWAS in determining the genetic architecture of cancer survival remains unestablished. Here, we systematically evaluated genetic effects at the genome-wide level on cancer survival that included overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), leveraging data deposited in the UK Biobank cohort of a total of 19 628 incident patients across 17 cancer types. Furthermore, we assessed the causal effects of risk factors and circulating biomarkers on cancer prognosis via a Mendelian randomization (MR) analytic framework, which integrated cancer survival GWAS dataset, along with phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) and blood genome-wide gene expression/DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (eQTL/meQTL) datasets. On average, more than 10 traits, 700 genes, and 4,500 CpG sites were prone to cancer prognosis.

Much work is currently being conducted to investigate the mechanisms of ICB therapy at the transcriptional level. Integrating the data produced by these studies will help us give more insight into the transcriptomic features of ICB therapy. We collected the transcriptome and clinical data of ICB-treated patient samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus, ArrayExpress, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and dbGaP databases. On the basis of the clinical information, all samples are initially classified into response/nonresponse or pretreatment/on-treatment groups. Differential expression, pathway enrichment, and immune cell infiltration analyses are performed between the samples from different groups. We also introduce the Response Score (RS) calculated by integrating the variability degree and the frequency of the dysregulated genes in the responders to evaluate the impact of gene expression on the response. Finally, all the abovementioned contents are integrated into the ICBatlas database. ICBatlas provides the transcriptome features of ICB therapy through the analysis of 1,515 ICB-treated samples from 25 studies across nine cancer types. The data in ICBatlas include clinical outcomes, treatment-related genes, biological pathways, and immune cell infiltration. Users can investigate the abovementioned transcriptome features in the response (R vs. NR) or treatment (Pre vs. On) modules at the data set, cancer type, or immune checkpoint level and compare the degree of gene impact on the response in the RS module.

Here, we present VirulentHunter, a novel deep learning framework that enable simultaneous VF identification and classification directly from protein sequences by leveraging the crucial step of fine-tuning pretrained protein language model. We curate a comprehensive VF database by integrating diverse public resources and expanding VF category annotations. Our benchmarking results demonstrate that VirulentHunter outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying VFs lacking detectable homologs. Additionally, strain-level analysis using VirulentHunter highlights distinct pathogenicity profiles between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium, revealing enrichment in VFs related to adherence, effector delivery systems, and immune modulation in M. tuberculosis, compared to biofilm formation and motility in M. avium. Furthermore, metagenomic profiling of gut microbiota from inflammatory bowel disease patient reveals a depletion of VFs associated with immune homeostasis.

To facilitate the study of eukaryotic replication events, we present a database of eukaryotic DNA replication origins (DeOri), which collects genome-wide data on eukaryotic DNA replication origins currently available. With the rapid development of high-throughput experimental technology in recent years, the number of datasets in the new release of DeOri 10.0 increased from 10 to 151 and the number of sequences increased from 16,145 to 9,742,396. Besides nucleotide sequences and browser extensible data (BED) files, corresponding annotation files, such as coding sequences (CDSs), mRNAs, and other biological elements within replication origins, are also provided. The experimental techniques used for each dataset, as well as related statistical data, are also presented on web page. Differences in experimental methods, cell lines, and sequencing technologies have resulted in distinct replication origins, making it challenging to differentiate between cell-specific and non-specific replication origins. Based on multiple replication origin datasets at the species level, we scored and screened replication origins in Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. The screened regions with high scores were considered as species-conservative origins, which are integrated and presented as reference replication origins (rORIs). Additionally, we analyzed the distribution of relevant genomic elements associated with replication origins at the genome level, such as CpG island (CGI), transcription start site (TSS), and G-quadruplex (G4).

Adhering to uniform and consistent criteria for microRNA annotation and nomenclature, we substantially expanded MirGeneDB with 30 additional species representing previously missing metazoan phyla such as sponges, jellyfish, rotifers and flatworms. MirGeneDB 2.1 now consists of 75 species spanning over ∼800 million years of animal evolution, and contains a total number of 16 670 microRNAs from 1549 families. Over 6000 microRNAs were added in this update using ∼550 datasets with ∼7.5 billion sequencing reads. By adding new phylogenetically important species, especially those relevant for the study of whole genome duplication events, and through updating evolutionary nodes of origin for many families and genes, we were able to substantially refine our nomenclature system. All changes are traceable in the specifically developed MirGeneDB version tracker. The performance of read-pages is improved and microRNA expression matrices for all tissues and species are now also downloadable. Altogether, this update represents a significant step toward a complete sampling of all major metazoan phyla, and a widely needed foundation for comparative microRNA genomics and transcriptomics studies.

34850139,CircNet 2.0: an updated database for exploring circular RNA regulatory networks in cancers.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are single-stranded RNA molecules that have individually formed into a covalently closed continuous loop, act as sponges of microRNAs to regulate transcription and translation. CircRNAs are important molecules in the field of cancer diagnosis, as growing evidence suggests that they are closely related to pathological cancer features. Therefore, they have high potential for clinical use as novel cancer biomarkers. In this article, we present our updates to CircNet (version 2.0), into which circRNAs from circAtlas and MiOncoCirc, and novel circRNAs from The Cancer Genome Atlas database have been integrated. In total, 2732 samples from 37 types of cancers were integrated into CircNet 2.0 and analyzed using several of the most reliable circRNA detection algorithms. Furthermore, target miRNAs were predicted from the full-length circRNA sequence using three reliable tools (PITA, miRanda and TargetScan). Additionally, 384 897 experimentally verified miRNA-target interactions from miRTarBase were integrated into our database to facilitate the construction of high-quality circRNA-miRNA-gene regulatory networks. These improvements, along with the user-friendly interactive web interface for data presentation, search, and visualization, showcase the updated CircNet database as a powerful, experimentally validated resource, for providing strong data support in the biomedical fields.

To facilitate cavity detection and property analysis process, we developed a comprehensive web server, CavityPlus in 2018. CavityPlus applies the CAVITY program to detect potential binding sites in a given protein structure. The CavPharmer, CorrSite, and CovCys tools can then be applied to generate receptor-based pharmacophore models, identify potential allosteric sites, or detect druggable cysteine residues for covalent drug design. While CavityPlus has been widely used, the constantly evolving knowledge and methods make it necessary to improve and extend its functions. This study presents a new version of CavityPlus, CavityPlus 2022 through a series of upgrades. We upgraded the CAVITY tool to greatly speed up cavity detection calculation. We optimized the CavPharmer tool for fast speed and more accurate results. We integrated the newly developed CorrSite2.0 into the CavityPlus 2022 web server for its improved performance of allosteric site prediction.

We previously developed the RMDisease database for unveiling the association between genetic variants and RMs concerning human disease pathogenesis. In this work, we present RMDisease v2.0, an updated database with expanded coverage. Using deep learning models and from 873 819 experimentally validated RM sites, we identified a total of 1 366 252 RM-associated variants that may affect (add or remove an RM site) 16 different types of RNA modifications (m6A, m5C, m1A, m5U, Ψ, m6Am, m7G, A-to-I, ac4C, Am, Cm, Um, Gm, hm5C, D and f5C) in 20 organisms (human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, maize, fruit fly, yeast, fission yeast, Arabidopsis, rice, chicken, goat, sheep, pig, cow, rhesus monkey, tomato, chimpanzee, green monkey and SARS-CoV-2). Among them, 14 749 disease- and 2441 trait-associated genetic variants may function via the perturbation of epitranscriptomic markers.

However, there are currently no resources providing a comprehensive listing of gene-disease associations discovered by TWAS from published GWAS summary statistics. TWAS analyses are also difficult to conduct due to the complexity of TWAS software pipelines. To address these issues, we introduce a new resource called webTWAS, which integrates a database of the most comprehensive disease GWAS datasets currently available with credible sets of potential causal genes identified by multiple TWAS software packages. Specifically, a total of 235 064 gene-diseases associations for a wide range of human diseases are prioritized from 1298 high-quality downloadable European GWAS summary statistics. Associations are calculated with seven different statistical models based on three popular and representative TWAS software packages. Users can explore associations at the gene or disease level, and easily search for related studies or diseases using the MeSH disease tree. Since the effects of diseases are highly tissue-specific, webTWAS applies tissue-specific enrichment analysis to identify significant tissues.

The degree of protein ubiquitination is tightly determined by the delicate balance between specific ubiquitin ligase (E3)-mediated ubiquitination and deubiquitinase-mediated deubiquitination. In 2017, we developed UbiBrowser 1.0, which is an integrated database for predicted human proteome-wide E3-substrate interactions. Here, to meet the urgent requirement of proteome-wide E3/deubiquitinase-substrate interactions (ESIs/DSIs) in multiple organisms, we updated UbiBrowser to version 2.0 (http://ubibrowser.ncpsb.org.cn). Using an improved protocol, we collected 4068/967 known ESIs/DSIs by manual curation, and we predicted about 2.2 million highly confident ESIs/DSIs in 39 organisms, with >210-fold increase in total data volume. In addition, we made several new features in the updated version: (i) it allows exploring proteins' upstream E3 ligases and deubiquitinases simultaneously; (ii) it has significantly increased species coverage; (iii) it presents a uniform confidence scoring system to rank predicted ESIs/DSIs. To facilitate the usage of UbiBrowser 2.0, we also redesigned the web interface for exploring these known and predicted ESIs/DSIs, and added functions of 'Browse', 'Download' and 'Application Programming Interface'.

Membrane permeability is an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting, and the development of membrane-permeable peptides is a bottleneck in cyclic peptide drug discovery. Although many experimental data on membrane permeability of cyclic peptides have been reported, a comprehensive database is not yet available. A comprehensive membrane permeability database is essential for developing computational methods for cyclic peptide drug design. In this study, we constructed CycPeptMPDB, the first web-accessible database of cyclic peptide membrane permeability. We collected information on a total of 7334 cyclic peptides, including the structure and experimentally measured membrane permeability, from 45 published papers and 2 patents from pharmaceutical companies. To unambiguously represent cyclic peptides larger than small molecules, we used the hierarchical editing language for macromolecules notation to generate a uniform sequence representation of peptides.

35669450,HPMPdb: A machine learning-ready database of protein molecular phenotypes associated to human missense variants.,"Current human Single Amino acid Variants (SAVs) databases provide a link between a SAVs and their effect on the carrier individual phenotype, often dividing them into Deleterious/Neutral variants. This is a very coarse-grained description of the genotype-to-phenotype relationship because it relies on un-realistic assumptions such as the perfect Mendelian behavior of each SAV and considers only dichotomic phenotypes. Moreover, the link between the effect of a SAV on a protein (its molecular phenotype) and the individual phenotype is often very complex, because multiple level of biological abstraction connect the protein and individual level phenotypes. Here we present HPMPdb, a manually curated database containing human SAVs associated with the detailed description of the molecular phenotype they cause on the affected proteins. With particular regards to machine learning (ML), this database can be used to let researchers go beyond the existing Deleterious/Neutral prediction paradigm, allowing them to build molecular phenotype predictors instead. Our class labels describe in a succinct way the effects that each SAV has on 15 protein molecular phenotypes, such as protein-protein interaction, small molecules binding, function, post-translational modifications (PTMs), sub-cellular localization, mimetic PTM, folding and protein expression.

38864430,AMLdb: a comprehensive multi-omics platform to identify biomarkers and drug targets for acute myeloid leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the leading leukemic malignancies in adults. The heterogeneity of the disease makes the diagnosis and treatment extremely difficult. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, exploration at the molecular level for the identification of biomarkers and drug targets has been the focus for the researchers to come up with novel therapies for better prognosis and survival outcomes of AML patients. However, the huge amount of data from NGS platforms requires a comprehensive AML platform to streamline literature mining efforts and save time. To facilitate this, we developed AMLdb, an interactive multi-omics platform that allows users to query, visualize, retrieve, and analyse AML related multi-omics data. AMLdb contains 86 datasets for gene expression profiles, 15 datasets for methylation profiles, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens of 26 AML cell lines, sensitivity of 26 AML cell lines to 288 drugs, mutations in 41 unique genes in 23 AML cell lines, and information on 41 experimentally validated biomarkers. In this study, we have reported five genes, i.e. CBFB, ENO1, IMPDH2, SEPHS2, and MYH9 identified via our analysis using AMLdb. ENO1 is uniquely identified gene which requires further investigation as a novel potential target while other reported genes have been previously confirmed as targets through experimental studies.

39470732,VDGE: a data repository of variation database for gene-edited animals across multiple species.,"Gene-edited animals are crucial for addressing fundamental questions in biology and medicine and hold promise for practical applications. In light of the rapid advancement of gene editing technologies over the past decade, a dramatically increased number of gene-edited animals have been generated. Genome editing at off-target sites can, however, introduce genomic variations, potentially leading to unintended functional consequences in these animals. So, there is an urgent need to systematically collect and collate these variations in gene-edited animals to aid data mining and integrative in-depth analyses. However, existing databases are currently insufficient to meet this need. Here, we present the Variation Database of Gene-Edited animals (VDGE, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge), the first open-access repository to present genomic variations and annotations in gene-edited animals, with a particular focus on larger animals such as monkeys. At present, VDGE houses 151 on-target mutations from 210 samples, and 115,710 variations identified from 107 gene-edited and wild-type animal trios through unified and standardized analysis and concurrently provides comprehensive annotation details for each variation, thus facilitating the assessment of their functional consequences and promoting mechanistic studies and practical applications for gene-edited animals.",True,False,4.5,,,vdge,16.0,ok,,variation database of gene-edited animals,,spacy,0.0,VDGE,True,10.0,True,True,https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge,https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge,True,"...Variation Database of Gene-Edited animals (VDGE, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge), the first open-access repository to present gen...",1

To address the critical need for molecular resources in diabetes research, we present DiabetesOmic (https://bio.liclab.net/diabetesOmicdb/), a comprehensive multi-omics database designed to collect and analyze transcriptional regulatory information across five high-throughput sequencing modalities, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, scATAC-seq, and scRNA-seq. Currently, DiabetesOmic contains 487 samples, encompassing type 1 and type 2 diabetes spanning multiple tissues. These data underwent stringent quality assessment to ensure high-quality molecular profiles. Notably, we manually curated clinical complication annotations including diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and atherosclerosis to enhance translational relevance. For each type of sequencing data, we implemented specific analytical pipelines to generate multi-dimensional transcriptional regulatory information, including regulatory network identification, differential gene expression analysis, chromatin accessibility analysis, and transcription factor enrichment analysis. This comprehensive analysis enables the identification of disease-associated regulatory elements, epigenetic modifications, and cell type-specific molecular signatures, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of diabetes and its complications.

These effects have been studied on very limited and small datasets while, ideally, a large dataset of binding affinity changes due to binding site single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is needed for evaluation. However, to the best of our knowledge, such a dataset does not exist. Thus, a reference dataset of ligands binding affinities to proteins with all their reported binding sites' variants was constructed using a molecular docking approach. Having a large database of protein-ligand complexes covering a wide range of binding pocket mutations and a large small molecules' landscape is of great importance for several types of studies. For example, developing machine learning algorithms to predict protein-ligand affinity or a SNP effect on it requires an extensive amount of data. In this work, we present PSnpBind: A large database of 0.6 million mutated binding site protein-ligand complexes constructed using a multithreaded virtual screening workflow.

While structure search methods can provide valuable insights, inferring distant evolutionary relationships with sequences alone remains challenging. Here, we introduce PLMSearch and PLMAlign, two protein language model (PLM)-based tools for searching and aligning remote homologous sequences. PLMSearch is a novel method for homologous protein search with only sequences as input. It leverages deep representations from a pretrained protein language model and trains the similarity prediction model with a large number of real structure similarities, enabling it to detect remote homologies embedded behind the sequences. PLMAlign is a protein sequence alignment tool designed to accurately align the identified homologous pairs. We offer two distinct Web servers for PLMSearch and PLMAlign, freely available at https://dmiip.sjtu.edu.cn/PLMSearch and https://dmiip.sjtu.edu.cn/PLMAlign , respectively.

36587232,TCMSID: a simplified integrated database for drug discovery from traditional chinese medicine.,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases for millennia. In the modernization process of TCM, TCM ingredient databases are playing more and more important roles. However, most of the existing TCM ingredient databases do not provide simplification function for extracting key ingredients in each herb or formula, which hinders the research on the mechanism of actions of the ingredients in TCM databases. The lack of quality control and standardization of the data in most of these existing databases is also a prominent disadvantage. Therefore, we developed a Traditional Chinese Medicine Simplified Integrated Database (TCMSID) with high storage, high quality and standardization. The database includes 499 herbs registered in the Chinese pharmacopeia with 20,015 ingredients, 3270 targets as well as corresponding detailed information. TCMSID is not only a database of herbal ingredients, but also a TCM simplification platform. Key ingredients from TCM herbs are available to be screened out and regarded as representatives to explore the mechanism of TCM herbs by implementing multi-tool target prediction and multilevel network construction. TCMSID provides abundant data sources and analysis platforms for TCM simplification and drug discovery, which is expected to promote modernization and internationalization of TCM and enhance its international status in the future.

DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been implicated in both the aging processes and the development of AD. Given that AD affects more women than men, it is also important to explore DNAm changes that occur specifically in each sex. We created MIAMI-AD, a comprehensive knowledgebase containing manually curated summary statistics from 98 published tables in 38 studies, all of which included at least 100 participants. MIAMI-AD enables easy browsing, querying, and downloading DNAm associations at multiple levels-at individual CpG, gene, genomic regions, or genome-wide, in one or multiple studies. Moreover, it also offers tools to perform integrative analyses, such as comparing DNAm associations across different phenotypes or tissues, as well as interactive visualizations. Using several use case examples, we demonstrated that MIAMI-AD facilitates our understanding of age-associated CpGs in AD and the sex-specific roles of DNAm in AD.

39192607,Autoinhibited Protein Database: a curated database of autoinhibitory domains and their autoinhibition mechanisms.,"Autoinhibition, a crucial allosteric self-regulation mechanism in cell signaling, ensures signal propagation exclusively in the presence of specific molecular inputs. The heightened focus on autoinhibited proteins stems from their implication in human diseases, positioning them as potential causal factors or therapeutic targets. However, the absence of a comprehensive knowledgebase impedes a thorough understanding of their roles and applications in drug discovery. Addressing this gap, we introduce Autoinhibited Protein Database (AiPD), a curated database standardizing information on autoinhibited proteins. AiPD encompasses details on autoinhibitory domains (AIDs), their targets, regulatory mechanisms, experimental validation methods, and implications in diseases, including associated mutations and post-translational modifications. AiPD comprises 698 AIDs from 532 experimentally characterized autoinhibited proteins and 2695 AIDs from their 2096 homologs, which were retrieved from 864 published articles. AiPD also includes 42 520 AIDs of computationally predicted autoinhibited proteins. In addition, AiPD facilitates users in investigating potential AIDs within a query sequence through comparisons with documented autoinhibited proteins. As the inaugural autoinhibited protein repository, AiPD significantly aids researchers studying autoinhibition mechanisms and their alterations in human diseases. It is equally valuable for developing computational models, analyzing allosteric protein regulation, predicting new drug targets, and understanding intervention mechanisms AiPD serves as a valuable resource for diverse researchers, contributing to the understanding and manipulation of autoinhibition in cellular processes.

The intrinsic radiosensitivity or acquired radioresistance of tumor cells would affect the response to RT and clinical outcomes in patients. Thus, mining the regulatory mechanisms in tumor radiosensitivity or radioresistance that have been verified by biological experiments and computational analysis methods will enhance the overall understanding of RT. Here, we describe a comprehensive database dbCRAF (http://dbCRAF.xialab.info/) to document and annotate the factors (1,677 genes, 49 proteins and 612 radiosensitizers) linked with radiation response, including radiosensitivity, radioresistance in cancer cells and prognosis in cancer patients receiving RT. On the one hand, dbCRAF enables researchers to directly access knowledge for regulation of radiation response in human cancer buried in the vast literature. On the other hand, dbCRAF provides four flexible modules to analyze and visualize the functional relationship between these factors and clinical outcome, KEGG pathway and target genes.

37030102,EPEK: Creation and analysis of an Ectopic Pregnancy Expression Knowledgebase.,"Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, where the fertilized embryo grows outside of the uterus. Recent experiments on mice have uncovered the importance of genetic factors in the transport of embryos inside the uterus. In the past, efforts have been made to identify possible gene or protein markers in EP in humans through multiple expression studies. Although there exist comprehensive gene resources for other maternal health disorders, there is no specific resource that compiles the genes associated with EP from such expression studies. Here, we address that knowledge gap by creating a computational resource, Ectopic Pregnancy Expression Knowledgebase (EPEK), that involves manual compilation and curation of expression profiles of EP in humans from published articles. In EPEK, we compiled information on 314 differentially expressed genes, 17 metabolites, and 3 SNPs associated with EP. Computational analyses on the gene set from EPEK showed the implication of cellular signaling processes in EP. We also identified possible exosome markers that could be clinically relevant in the diagnosis of EP.

The incidence of ESDs has increased in recent years, often accompanying other chronic diseases, and can lead to disability. A growing body of research suggests that lncRNA plays an important role in the progression and metastasis of ESDs. However, there are no resources focused on collecting and integrating the latest and experimentally supported lncRNA-ESD associations. Hence, we developed an ENCD database that consists of 1379 associations between 35 ESDs and 501 lncRNAs in 12 human tissues curated from literature. By using ENCD, users can explore the genetic data for diseases corresponding to the body parts of interest as well as study the lncRNA regulating mechanism for ESDs. ENCD also provides a flexible tool to visualize a disease- or gene-centric regulatory network. In addition, ENCD offers a submission page for researchers to submit their newly discovered endocrine disorders-genetic data entries online.

The number of single-cell-based studies increased dramatically over the past decade. Several new methods and tools have been continuously developed, making it extremely tricky to navigate this research landscape and develop an up-to-date workflow to analyze single-cell sequencing data, particularly for researchers seeking to enter this field without computational experience. Moreover, choosing appropriate tools and optimal parameters to meet the demands of researchers represents a major challenge in processing single-cell sequencing data. However, a specific resource for easy access to detailed information on single-cell sequencing methods and data processing pipelines is still lacking. In the present study, an online resource called SingleScan was developed to curate all up-to-date single-cell transcriptome/genome analyzing tools and pipelines. All the available tools were categorized according to their main tasks, and several typical workflows for single-cell data analysis were summarized. In addition, spatial transcriptomics, which is a breakthrough molecular analysis method that enables researchers to measure all gene activity in tissue samples and map the site of activity, was included along with a portion of single-cell and spatial analysis solutions. For each processing step, the available tools and specific parameters used in published articles are provided and how these parameters affect the results is shown in the resource. All information used in the resource was manually extracted from related literature. An interactive website was designed for data retrieval, visualization, and download. By analyzing the included tools and literature, users can gain insights into the trends of single-cell studies and easily grasp the specific usage of a specific tool.

Using an original high-throughput microscopy system and machine learning algorithms, we analysed the localization patterns of 10 287 fluorescent protein-fused human proteins in HeLa cells before and after exposure to oxidative stress. Our analysis revealed that 1910 proteins exhibited oxidative stress-dependent localization changes, particularly forming distinct foci. Among them, there were stress granule assembly factors and autophagy-related proteins, as well as components of various signalling pathways. Subsequent characterization identified some specific amino acid motifs and intrinsically disordered regions associated with stress-induced protein redistribution.

(2021) Computational drug repositioning based on the relationships between substructure-indication. Brief. Bioinformatics, 22, bbaa348) was embedded. Our algorithm integrates characteristics of chemical genomics and pharmacogenomics, breaking through the limitations that traditional drug development process based on phenotype cannot analyze the mechanism of drug action. Predicting phenotypes of drug action based on the local active structures of drugs and proteins can achieve more innovative drug discovery across drug categories and simultaneously evaluate drug efficacy and safety, rather than traditional one-by-one evaluation. DAPredict contains 305 981 predicted relationships between 1748 approved drugs and 454 ADRs, 83 117 predicted relationships between 1478 approved drugs and 178 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemicals (ATC). More importantly, DAPredict provides an online prediction tool, which researchers can use to predict the action phenotypic spectrum of more than 110 000 000 compounds (including about 168 000 natural products) and corresponding proteins to analyze their potential effect mechanisms. DAPredict can also help researchers obtain the phenotype-corresponding active structures for structural optimization of new drug candidates, making it easier to evaluate the druggability of new drug candidates and develop more innovative drugs across drug categories.

38685101,QuanDB: a quantum chemical property database towards enhancing 3D molecular representation learning.,"Previous studies have shown that the three-dimensional (3D) geometric and electronic structure of molecules play a crucial role in determining their key properties and intermolecular interactions. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a quantum chemical (QC) property database containing the most stable 3D geometric conformations and electronic structures of molecules. In this study, a high-quality QC property database, called QuanDB, was developed, which included structurally diverse molecular entities and featured a user-friendly interface. Currently, QuanDB contains 154,610 compounds sourced from public databases and scientific literature, with 10,125 scaffolds. The elemental composition comprises nine elements: H, C, O, N, P, S, F, Cl, and Br. For each molecule, QuanDB provides 53 global and 5 local QC properties and the most stable 3D conformation. These properties are divided into three categories: geometric structure, electronic structure, and thermodynamics. Geometric structure optimization and single point energy calculation at the theoretical level of B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G(d)/SMD/water and B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP/SMD/water, respectively, were applied to ensure highly accurate calculations of QC properties, with the computational cost exceeding 107 core-hours. QuanDB provides high-value geometric and electronic structure information for use in molecular representation models, which are critical for machine-learning-based molecular design, thereby contributing to a comprehensive description of the chemical compound space. As a new high-quality dataset for QC properties, QuanDB is expected to become a benchmark tool for the training and optimization of machine learning models, thus further advancing the development of novel drugs and materials.

More importantly, profile-based approaches remarkably enhance novel drug-disease pair discovery without relying on drug- or disease-specific prior knowledge, which has been widely used in modern medicine. However, profile-based systematic screening of active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been scarcely performed due to inadequate pharmacotranscriptomic data. Here, we develop the largest-to-date online TCM active ingredients-based pharmacotranscriptomic platform integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) for the effective screening of active ingredients. First, we performed unified high-throughput experiments and constructed the largest data repository of 496 representative active ingredients, which was five times larger than the previous one built by our team. The transcriptome-based multi-scale analysis was also performed to elucidate their mechanism. Then, we developed six state-of-art signature search methods to screen active ingredients and determine the optimal signature size for all methods. Moreover, we integrated them into a screening strategy, TCM-Query, to identify the potential active ingredients for the special disease. In addition, we also comprehensively collected the TCM-related resource by literature mining. Finally, we applied ITCM to an active ingredient bavachinin, and two diseases, including prostate cancer and COVID-19, to demonstrate the power of drug discovery. ITCM was aimed to comprehensively explore the active ingredients of TCM and boost studies of pharmacological action and drug discovery.

36243964,isomiRdb: microRNA expression at isoform resolution.,"A significant fraction of mature miRNA transcripts carries sequence and/or length variations, termed isomiRs. IsomiRs are differentially abundant in cell types, tissues, body fluids or patients' samples. Not surprisingly, multiple studies describe a physiological and pathophysiological role. Despite their importance, systematically collected and annotated isomiR information available in databases remains limited. We thus developed isomiRdb, a comprehensive resource that compiles miRNA expression data at isomiR resolution from various sources. We processed 42 499 human miRNA-seq datasets (5.9 × 1011 sequencing reads) and consistently analyzed them using miRMaster and sRNAbench. Our database provides online access to the 90 483 most abundant isomiRs (>1 RPM in at least 1% of the samples) from 52 tissues and 188 cell types. Additionally, the full set of over 3 million detected isomiRs is available for download. Our resource can be queried at the sample, miRNA or isomiR level so users can quickly answer common questions about the presence/absence of a particular miRNA/isomiR in tissues of interest. Further, the database facilitates to identify whether a potentially interesting new isoform has been detected before and its frequency.

38865431,EUKARYOME: the rRNA gene reference database for identification of all eukaryotes.,"Molecular identification of micro- and macroorganisms based on nuclear markers has revolutionized our understanding of their taxonomy, phylogeny and ecology. Today, research on the diversity of eukaryotes in global ecosystems heavily relies on nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) markers. Here, we present the research community-curated reference database EUKARYOME for nuclear ribosomal 18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA markers for all eukaryotes, including metazoans (animals), protists, fungi and plants. It is particularly useful for the identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as it bridges the four commonly used molecular markers-ITS1, ITS2, 18S V4-V5 and 28S D1-D2 subregions. The key benefits of this database over other annotated reference sequence databases are that it is not restricted to certain taxonomic groups and it includes all rRNA markers. EUKARYOME also offers a number of reference long-read sequences that are derived from (meta)genomic and (meta)barcoding-a unique feature that can be used for taxonomic identification and chimera control of third-generation, long-read, high-throughput sequencing data.

We developed a web-based tool PESSA for survival analysis using gene set activation levels. All data analyses were implemented via R. Activation levels of The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets were assessed using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method based on data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) and supplementary tables of articles. PESSA was used to perform median and optimal cut-off dichotomous grouping of ssGSEA scores for each dataset, relying on the survival and survminer packages for survival analysis and visualisation. PESSA is an open-access web tool for visualizing the results of tumor prognostic analyses using gene set activation levels. A total of 238 datasets from the GEO, TCGA, EGA, and supplementary tables of articles; covering 51 cancer types and 13 survival outcome types; and 13,434 tumor-related gene sets are obtained from MSigDB for pre-grouping. Users can obtain the results, including Kaplan-Meier analyses based on the median and optimal cut-off values and accompanying visualization plots and the Cox regression analyses of dichotomous and continuous variables, by selecting the gene set markers of interest.

40536622,Risk factors for early mortality among patients with gastrointestinal malignancy in the C-CAT database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) is essential for precision medicine, but early mortality remains a concern for patients undergoing CGP. This study aimed to identify risk factors for early mortality and develop a prediction model for gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies on the basis of data from the Japanese C-CAT database.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from 18,657 patients with pancreatic, biliary, colorectal, and upper GI cancers were collected from the C-CAT database and retrospectively analyzed. Early mortality was defined as mortality within 90 days after CGP submission. A prediction model was constructed via weighted scoring of clinical factors, and the model was subsequently validated. Survival analysis was conducted to assess the utility of this model for prognostic stratification.<h4>Results</h4>The early mortality rate was 14.2%. Independent predictors of early mortality included cancer type (pancreatic/biliary), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) ≥2, metastases, disease progression, and male sex. The prediction model stratified patients into low- (6.1%), intermediate- (17.6%), high-risk (39.2%), and very high-risk (75.6%) groups with a moderate level of discrimination (C statistic: 0.70-0.73). Survival analysis revealed that the median survival times after CGP submission for each group were 384.0 days, 199.0 days, 114.0 days, and 48.0 days, respectively.

Following the rapid development of systems biology technology, a growing number of studies have applied proteomics and metabolomics to explore the molecular profiles of depression. However, a standardized resource facilitating the identification and annotation of the available knowledge from these scattered studies associated with depression is currently lacking. This study presents ProMENDA, an upgraded resource that provides a platform for manual annotation of candidate proteins and metabolites linked to depression. Following the establishment of the protein dataset and the update of the metabolite dataset, the ProMENDA database was developed as a major extension of its initial release.

In summary, 302,889 transcripts were obtained from the transcriptome assembly process, out of which 24% are absent from Ensembl database annotations, 48,213 contain a premature stop codon, and 6433 are significantly upregulated in three or more comparisons of NMD active versus deficient cell lines. We present an in-depth view of these results through the NMDtxDB database, which is available at https://shiny.dieterichlab.org/app/NMDtxDB, and supports the study of NMD-sensitive transcripts.

37260077,ARMADiLLO: a web server for analyzing antibody mutation probabilities.,"Antibodies are generated by B cells that evolve receptor specificity to pathogens through rounds of mutation and selection in a process called affinity maturation. Somatic hypermutation is mediated by an enzyme with DNA sequence context-dependent targeting and substitution resulting in variable probabilities of amino acid substitutions during affinity maturation. We have previously developed a program called Antigen Receptor Mutation Analyzer for the Detection of Low Likelihood Occurrences (ARMADiLLO) that performs simulations of the somatic hypermutation process to estimate the probabilities of observed antibody mutations. Here we describe the ARMADiLLO web server (https://armadillo.dhvi.duke.edu), an easy-to-use web interface that analyzes input antibody sequences and displays the probability estimates for all possible amino acid changes over the full length of an antibody sequence. The probability of antibody mutations can be used by immunologists studying B cell ontogenies and by vaccine designers that are pursuing strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies which are enriched with developmentally rate-limiting improbable mutations.

35801909,DEMoS: a deep learning-based ensemble approach for predicting the molecular subtypes of gastric adenocarcinomas from histopathological images.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The molecular subtyping of gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma) into four main subtypes based on integrated multiomics profiles, as proposed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) initiative, represents an effective strategy for patient stratification. However, this approach requires the use of multiple technological platforms, and is quite expensive and time-consuming to perform. A computational approach that uses histopathological image data to infer molecular subtypes could be a practical, cost- and time-efficient complementary tool for prognostic and clinical management purposes.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we propose a deep learning ensemble approach (called DEMoS) capable of predicting the four recognized molecular subtypes of gastric cancer directly from histopathological images. DEMoS achieved tile-level area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.785, 0.668, 0.762 and 0.811 for the prediction of these four subtypes of gastric cancer [i.e. (i) Epstein-Barr (EBV)-infected, (ii) microsatellite instability (MSI), (iii) genomically stable (GS) and (iv) chromosomally unstable tumors (CIN)] using an independent test dataset, respectively. At the patient-level, it achieved AUROC values of 0.897, 0.764, 0.890 and 0.898, respectively. Thus, these four subtypes are well-predicted by DEMoS. Benchmarking experiments further suggest that DEMoS is able to achieve an improved classification performance for image-based subtyping and prevent model overfitting. This study highlights the feasibility of using a deep learning ensemble-based method to rapidly and reliably subtype gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma) solely using features from histopathological images.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All whole slide images used in this study was collected from the TCGA database.

38587202,FEVER: an interactive web-based resource for evolutionary transcriptomics across fishes.,"Teleost fish represent one of the largest and most diverse clades of vertebrates, which makes them great models in various research areas such as ecology and evolution. Recent sequencing endeavors provided high-quality genomes for species covering the main fish evolutionary lineages, opening up large-scale comparative genomics studies. However, transcriptomic data across fish species and organs are heterogenous and have not been integrated with newly sequenced genomes making gene expression quantification and comparative analyses particularly challenging. Thus, resources integrating genomic and transcriptomic data across fish species and organs are still lacking. Here, we present FEVER, a web-based resource allowing evolutionary transcriptomics across species and tissues. First, based on query genes FEVER reconstructs gene trees providing orthologous and paralogous relationships as well as their evolutionary dynamics across 13 species covering the major fish lineages, and 4 model species as evolutionary outgroups. Second, it provides unbiased gene expression across 11 tissues using up-to-date fish genomes. Finally, genomic and transcriptomic data are combined together allowing the exploration of gene expression evolution following speciation and duplication events.

38587206,RNAhugs web server for customized 3D RNA structure alignment.,"Alignment of 3D molecular structures involves overlaying their sets of atoms in space in such a way as to minimize the distance between the corresponding atoms. The purpose of this procedure is usually to analyze and assess structural similarity on a global (e.g. evaluating predicted 3D models and clustering structures) or a local level (e.g. searching for common substructures). Although the idea of alignment is simple, combinatorial algorithms that implement it require considerable computational resources, even when processing relatively small structures. In this paper, we introduce RNAhugs, a web server for custom and flexible alignment of 3D RNA structures. Using two efficient heuristics, GEOS and GENS, it finds the longest corresponding fragments within 3D structures that may differ in sizes-given in the PDB or PDBx/mmCIF formats-that manage to align with user-specified accuracy (i.e. with an RMSD not exceeding a cutoff value given as an input parameter). A distinctive advantage of the system lies in its ability to process multi-model files and compare the results of 1-25 alignments in a single task.

In this manuscript, we introduce SplicingLore, an open-access database and web resource that help to fill this gap in a straightforward manner. The database contains a collection of RNA-sequencing-derived lists of alternative exons regulated by a total of 75 different SFs. All datasets were processed in a standardized manner, ensuring valid comparisons and correlation analyses. The user can easily retrieve a factor-specific set of differentially included exons from the database or provide a list of exons and search which SF(s) control(s) their inclusion. Our simple workflow is fast and easy to run, and it ensures a reliable calculation of correlation scores between the tested datasets.

Since many structures are determined with purification and crystallization additives that are unrelated to a protein's in vivo function, it is nontrivial to identify the subset of protein-ligand interactions that are biologically relevant. We developed the BioLiP2 database (https://zhanggroup.org/BioLiP) to extract biologically relevant protein-ligand interactions from the PDB database. BioLiP2 assesses the functional relevance of the ligands by geometric rules and experimental literature validations. The ligand binding information is further enriched with other function annotations, including Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms, catalytic sites, and binding affinities collected from other databases and a manual literature survey. Compared to its predecessor BioLiP, BioLiP2 offers significantly greater coverage of nucleic acid-protein interactions, and interactions involving large complexes that are unavailable in PDB format. BioLiP2 also integrates cutting-edge structural alignment algorithms with state-of-the-art structure prediction techniques, which for the first time enables composite protein structure and sequence-based searching and significantly enhances the usefulness of the database in structure-based function annotations.

35474383,KmerKeys: a web resource for searching indexed genome assemblies and variants.,"K-mers are short DNA sequences that are used for genome sequence analysis. Applications that use k-mers include genome assembly and alignment. However, the wider bioinformatic use of these short sequences has challenges related to the massive scale of genomic sequence data. A single human genome assembly has billions of k-mers. As a result, the computational requirements for analyzing k-mer information is enormous, particularly when involving complete genome assemblies. To address these issues, we developed a new indexing data structure based on a hash table tuned for the lookup of short sequence keys. This web application, referred to as KmerKeys, provides performant, rapid query speeds for cloud computation on genome assemblies. We enable fuzzy as well as exact sequence searches of assemblies. To enable robust and speedy performance, the website implements cache-friendly hash tables, memory mapping and massive parallel processing. Our method employs a scalable and efficient data structure that can be used to jointly index and search a large collection of human genome assembly information.

With novel viral infections emerging, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, novel antiviral therapies are urgently needed. Antiviral proteins, such as interferon, have been used for treating chronic hepatitis C infections for decades. Natural-origin antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins, have also been identified as possessing antiviral activities, including direct antiviral effects and the ability to induce indirect immune responses to viruses. To promote the development of antiviral drugs, we constructed a data repository of antiviral peptides and proteins (DRAVP). The database provides general information, antiviral activity, structure information, physicochemical information, and literature information for peptides and proteins. Because most of the proteins and peptides lack experimentally determined structures, AlphaFold was used to predict each antiviral peptide's structure.

However, the low response rate of the ICB therapy limits its application. To increase the response rate and enhance efficacy, the ICB combination therapy has emerged and its clinical trials are increasing. Nevertheless, the gene expression profile and its pattern of ICB combination were not comprehensively studied, which limits the understanding of the ICB combination therapy and the identification of new drugs.

37227514,BCLncRDB: a comprehensive database of LncRNAs associated with breast cancer.,"Breast cancer, the most common cancer in women, is characterized by high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer. However, despite increasing data and evidence indicating the implication of lncRNAs in breast cancer, no web resource or database exists primarily for lncRNAs associated with only breast cancer. Therefore, we developed a manually curated, comprehensive database, ""BCLncRDB,"" for lncRNAs associated with breast cancer. For this, we collected, processed, and analyzed available data on breast cancer-associated lncRNAs from different sources, including previously published research articles, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Ensembl database; subsequently, these data were hosted at BCLncRDB for public access. Currently, the database contains 5324 unique breast cancer-lncRNA associations and has the following features: (i) a user-friendly, easy-to-use web interface for searching and browsing about lncRNAs of the user's interest, (ii) differentially expressed and methylated lncRNAs, (iii) stage- and subtype-specific lncRNAs, and (iv) drugs, subcellular localization, sequence, and chromosome information of these lncRNAs.

Within these structures, numerous local structural sites depict the details characterizing structure and function. However, searching and analyzing these sites extensively and at scale poses a challenge. We present a new method to search local sites in protein structure databases using residue-defined local 3D micro-environments. We implemented the method in a new tool called MicroMiner and demonstrate the capabilities of residue micro-environment search on the example of structural mutation analysis. Usually, experimental structures for both the wild-type and the mutant are unavailable for comparison. With MicroMiner, we extracted $>255 \times 10^{6}$ amino acid pairs in protein structures from the PDB, exemplifying single mutations' local structural changes for single chains and $>45 \times 10^{6}$ pairs for protein-protein interfaces. We further annotate existing data sets of experimentally measured mutation effects, like $\Delta \Delta G$ measurements, with the extracted structure pairs to combine the mutation effect measurement with the structural change upon mutation. In addition, we show how MicroMiner can bridge the gap between mutation analysis and structure-based drug design tools.

While a considerable amount of research has been conducted on fibrosis, these reports have only focused on specific organs as affected within distinct disorders. Accordingly, results from such studies have been unable to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathological processes involved. Here, we describe the development of FibROAD, an open-access database that integrates evidence from fibrosis-associated disorders as obtained from both the literature and multi-omics data. This resource will greatly assist both researchers and clinicians in the comprehension and treatment of this condition. FibROAD currently involves an assembly of 232 strong evidence-based fibrosis-related genes (FRGs) as garnered from 909 PubMed publications and contains lists of multi-omics data from > 4000 samples including RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq MeDIP-seq and MBD-seq as obtained from 17 different organs in 5 species. Results from integrative analyses as obtained using FibROAD have demonstrated that FRGs can be indicators for a wide range of organ fibrosis and reveal potential pro-fibrotic candidate genes for fibrosis research.

Although new drug combinations screening has benefited from experimental tests like automated high throughput screening, it is limited due to the large number of possible drug combinations. The task of drug combination screening can be streamlined through computational methods and models. Such models require up-to-date databases; however, existing databases are static and consist of the data collected at the time of their creation. This paper introduces the Continuous Drug Combination Database (CDCDB), a continuously updated drug combination database.

Regulation of ferroptosis might be beneficial to cancer treatment. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of RNA transcripts that generally cannot encode proteins and have been demonstrated to play critical roles in regulating ferroptosis. Herein, we developed ncFO, the ncRNA-ferroptosis association database, to document the manually curated and predicted ncRNAs that are associated with ferroptosis. Collectively, ncFO contains 90 experimentally verified entries, including 46 microRNAs (miRNAs), 21 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 17 circular RNAs (circRNAs). In addition, ncFO also incorporates two online prediction tools based on the regulation and co-expression of ncRNA and ferroptosis genes. Using default parameters, we obtained 3260 predicted entries, including 598 miRNAs and 178 lncRNAs, by regulation, as well as 2,592,661 predicted entries, including 967 miRNAs and 9632 lncRNAs, by ncRNA-ferroptosis gene co-expression in more than 8000 samples across 20 cancer types. The detailed information of each entry includes ncRNA name, disease, species, tissue, target, regulation, publication time, and PubMed identifier. ncFO also provides survival analysis and differential expression analysis for ncRNAs. In summary, ncFO offers a user-friendly platform to search and predict ferroptosis-associated ncRNAs, which might facilitate research on ferroptosis and discover potential targets for cancer treatment. ncFO can be accessed at http://www.jianglab.cn/ncFO/.",True,False,4.5,,,ncfo,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,ncFO,True,3.0,True,True,http://www.jianglab.cn/ncFO/,http://www.jianglab.cn/ncFO/,True,...ets for cancer treatment. ncFO can be accessed at http://www.jianglab.cn/ncFO/.,1
37735613,SoyDBean: a database for SNPs reconciliation by multiple versions of soybean reference genomes.,"Due to the development of sequence technology and decreased cost, many whole genome sequences have been obtained. As a result, extensive genetic variations have been discovered from many populations and germplasms to understand the genetic diversity of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.). However, assessing the quality of variation is essential because the published variants were collected using different bioinformatic methods and parameters. Furthermore, despite the enhanced genome contiguity and more efficient filling of ""N"" stretches in the new reference genome, there remains a dearth of endeavors to verify the caliber of variations present in it. The primary goal of this research was to discern a dependable set of SNPs that can withstand reconciliation across multiple reference genomes. Additionally, the investigation aimed to reconfirm the variations through the utilization of numerous whole genome sequencing data obtained from publicly available databases. Based on the result, we created datasets that comprised the thoroughly verified SNP coordinates between the reference assemblies.

39226898,SpliceVarDB: A comprehensive database of experimentally validated human splicing variants.,"Variants that alter gene splicing are estimated to comprise up to a third of all disease-causing variants, yet they are hard to predict from DNA sequencing data alone. To overcome this, many groups are incorporating RNA-based analyses, which are resource intensive, particularly for diagnostic laboratories. There are thousands of functionally validated variants that induce mis-splicing; however, this information is not consolidated, and they are under-represented in ClinVar, which presents a barrier to variant interpretation and can result in duplication of validation efforts. To address this issue, we developed SpliceVarDB, an online database consolidating over 50,000 variants assayed for their effects on splicing in over 8,000 human genes. We evaluated over 500 published data sources and established a spliceogenicity scale to standardize, harmonize, and consolidate variant validation data generated by a range of experimental protocols. According to the strength of their supporting evidence, variants were classified as ""splice-altering"" (∼25%), ""not splice-altering"" (∼25%), and ""low-frequency splice-altering"" (∼50%), which correspond to weak or indeterminate evidence of spliceogenicity. Importantly, 55% of the splice-altering variants in SpliceVarDB are outside the canonical splice sites (5.6% are deep intronic). These variants can support the variant curation diagnostic pathway and can be used to provide the high-quality data necessary to develop more accurate in silico splicing predictors.

However, there is a lack of resources that can be used to mine and analyse these dynamically changing tRNA modifications. In this study, we established tModBase (https://www.tmodbase.com/) for deciphering the landscape of tRNA modification profiles from epitranscriptome data. We analysed 103 datasets generated with second- and third-generation sequencing technologies and illustrated the misincorporation and termination signals of tRNA modification sites in ten species. We thus systematically demonstrate the modification profiles across different tissues/cell lines and summarize the characteristics of tRNA-associated human diseases. By integrating transcriptome data from 32 cancers, we developed novel tools for analysing the relationships between tRNA modifications and RNA modification enzymes, the expression of 1442 tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), and 654 DNA variations.

39341795,SCancerRNA: Expression at the Single-cell Level and Interaction Resource of Non-coding RNA Biomarkers for Cancers.,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in multiple biological processes associated with cancers as tumor suppressors or oncogenic drivers. Due to their high stability in plasma, urine, and many other fluids, ncRNAs have the potential to serve as key biomarkers for early diagnosis and screening of cancers. During cancer progression, tumor heterogeneity plays a crucial role, and it is particularly important to understand the gene expression patterns of individual cells. With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, uncovering gene expression in different cell types for human cancers has become feasible by profiling transcriptomes at the cellular level. However, a well-organized and comprehensive online resource that provides access to the expression of genes corresponding to ncRNA biomarkers in different cell types at the single-cell level is not available yet. Therefore, we developed the SCancerRNA database to summarize experimentally supported data on long ncRNA, microRNA, PIWI-interacting RNA, small nucleolar RNA, and circular RNA biomarkers, as well as data on their differential expression at the cellular level. Furthermore, we collected biological functions and clinical applications of biomarkers to facilitate the application of ncRNA biomarkers to cancer diagnosis, as well as the monitoring of progression and targeted therapies. SCancerRNA also allows users to explore interaction networks of different types of ncRNAs, and build computational models in the future.

37162753,CaviDB: a database of cavities and their features in the structural and conformational space of proteins.,"Proteins are the structural, functional and evolutionary units of cells. On their surface, proteins are shaped into numerous depressions and protrusions that provide unique microenvironments for ligand binding and catalysis. The dynamics, size and chemical properties of these cavities are essential for a mechanistic understanding of protein function. Here, we present CaviDB, a novel database of cavities and their features in known protein structures. It integrates the results of commonly used cavity detection software with protein features derived from sequence, structural and functional analyses. Each protein in CaviDB is linked to its corresponding conformers, which also facilitates the study of conformational changes in cavities. Our initial release includes ∼927 773 distinct proteins, as well as the characterization of 36 136 869 cavities, of which 1 147 034 were predicted to be drug targets. The structural focus of CaviDB provides the ability to compare cavities and their properties from different conformational states of the protein. CaviDB not only aims to provide a comprehensive database that can be used for various aspects of drug design and discovery but also contributes to a better understanding of the fundamentals of protein structure-function relationships.

38244111,MyeloDB: a multi-omics resource for multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common type of blood cancer affecting plasma cells originating from the lymphoid B-cell lineage. It accounts for about 10% of all hematological malignancies and can cause significant end-organ damage. The emergence of genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression analysis has opened new possibilities for early detection of multiple myeloma and identification of personalized treatment options. However, there remain significant challenges to overcome in MM research, including integrating multi-omics data, achieving a comprehensive understanding of the disease, and developing targeted therapies and biomarkers. The extensive data generated by these technologies presents another challenge for data analysis and interpretation. To bridge this gap, we have developed a multi-omics open-access database called MyeloDB. It includes gene expression profiling, high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screens, drug sensitivity resources profile, and biomarkers. MyeloDB contains 47 expression profiles, 3 methylation profiles comprising a total of 5630 patient samples and 25 biomarkers which were reported in previous studies. In addition to this, MyeloDB can provide significant insight of gene mutations in MM on drug sensitivity. Furthermore, users can download the datasets and conduct their own analyses. Utilizing this database, we have identified five novel genes, i.e., CBFB, MANF, MBNL1, SEPHS2, and UFM1 as potential drug targets for MM.

The rapid development of omics studies on horticultural plants has resulted in large volumes of valuable growth- and development-related data. Genes that are essential for growth and development are highly conserved in evolution. Cross-species data mining reduces the impact of species heterogeneity and has been extensively used for conserved gene identification. Owing to the lack of a comprehensive database for cross-species data mining using multi-omics data from all horticultural plant species, the current resources in this field are far from satisfactory. Here, we introduce GERDH (https://dphdatabase.com), a database platform for cross-species data mining among horticultural plants, based on 12 961 uniformly processed publicly available omics libraries from more than 150 horticultural plant accessions, including fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants.

To achieve clinical-level drug recommendations, a platform for clinical patient case retrieval and reliable drug sensitivity prediction is highly expected. Therefore, we built a database, D3EGFRdb, with the clinicopathologic characteristics and drug responses of 1339 patients with EGFR mutations via literature mining. On the basis of D3EGFRdb, we developed a deep learning-based prediction model, D3EGFRAI, for drug sensitivity prediction of new EGFR mutation-driven NSCLC. Model validations of D3EGFRAI showed a prediction accuracy of 0.81 and 0.85 for patients from D3EGFRdb and our hospitals, respectively.

Although being increasingly discovered, the functional role of the majority of lncRNAs in diverse biological conditions is undefined. Increasing evidence supports the critical role of lncRNAs in the emergence, regulation, and progression of various viral infections including influenza, hepatitis, coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Hence, the identification of signature lncRNAs would facilitate focused analysis of their functional roles accounting for their targets and regulatory mechanisms associated with infections. Towards this, we compiled 2803 lncRNAs identified to be modulated by 33 viral strains in various mammalian cell types and are provided through the resource named VirhostlncR (http://ciods.in/VirhostlncR/). The information on each of the viral strains, their multiplicity of infection, duration of infection, host cell name and cell types, fold change of lncRNA expression, and their specific identification methods are integrated into VirhostlncR.

Non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in germline have long been reported to play a pivotal role in cancer progression.<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of this study is to examine the nsSNP in GC-associated genes. The study also aims to develop a database with extensive information regarding the nsSNPs in the GC-associated genes and their impacts.<h4>Methods and results</h4>A total of 34,588 nsSNPs from 1,493,460 SNPs of the 40 genes were extracted from the available SNP database. Drug binding and energy minimization were examined by molecular docking and YASARA. To validate the existence of the germline CDH1 gene mutation (rs34466743) in the isolated blood DNA of gastric cancer (GC) patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing were performed. According to the results of the gene network analysis, 17 genes may interact with other types of cancer. A total of 11,363 nsSNPs were detected within the 40 GC genes. Among these, 474 nsSNPs were predicted to be damaging and 40 to be the most damaging. The SNPs in domain regions were thought to be strong candidates that alter protein functions. Our findings proposed that most of the selected nsSNPs were within the domains or motif regions. Free Energy Deviation calculation of protein structure pointed toward noteworthy changes in the structure of each protein that can demolish its natural function. Subsequently, drug binding confirmed the structural variation and the ineffectiveness of the drug against the mutant model in individuals with these germline variants. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of the rs34466743 germline variant from the CDH1 gene confirmed the strength and robustness of the pipeline that could expand the somatic alteration for causing cancer. In addition, a comprehensive gastric cancer polymorphism database named ""GasCanBase"" was developed to make data available to researchers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings of this study and the ""GasCanBase"" database may greatly contribute to our understanding of molecular epidemiology and the development of precise therapeutics for gastric cancer.

35524557,"iFeatureOmega: an integrative platform for engineering, visualization and analysis of features from molecular sequences, structural and ligand data sets.","The rapid accumulation of molecular data motivates development of innovative approaches to computationally characterize sequences, structures and functions of biological and chemical molecules in an efficient, accessible and accurate manner. Notwithstanding several computational tools that characterize protein or nucleic acids data, there are no one-stop computational toolkits that comprehensively characterize a wide range of biomolecules. We address this vital need by developing a holistic platform that generates features from sequence and structural data for a diverse collection of molecule types. Our freely available and easy-to-use iFeatureOmega platform generates, analyzes and visualizes 189 representations for biological sequences, structures and ligands. To the best of our knowledge, iFeatureOmega provides the largest scope when directly compared to the current solutions, in terms of the number of feature extraction and analysis approaches and coverage of different molecules. We release three versions of iFeatureOmega including a webserver, command line interface and graphical interface to satisfy needs of experienced bioinformaticians and less computer-savvy biologists and biochemists. With the assistance of iFeatureOmega, users can encode their molecular data into representations that facilitate construction of predictive models and analytical studies. We highlight benefits of iFeatureOmega based on three research applications, demonstrating how it can be used to accelerate and streamline research in bioinformatics, computational biology, and cheminformatics areas.

To address this need, we introduce ChemoDOTS, an easy-to-use web server for hit-to-lead chemical optimization freely available at https://chemodots.marseille.inserm.fr/. With this tool, users enter an activated form of the initial hit molecule then choose from automatically detected reactive functions. The server proposes compatible chemical transformations via an ensemble of encoded chemical reactions widely used in the pharmaceutical industry during hit-to-lead optimization. After selection of the desired reactions, all compatible chemical building blocks are automatically coupled to the initial hit to generate a raw chemical library. Post-processing filters can be applied to extract a subset of compounds with specific physicochemical properties. Finally, explicit stereoisomers and tautomers are computed, and a 3D conformer is generated for each molecule.

35754095,DoPI: The Database of Pollinator Interactions.,"Despite the importance of pollinating insects to natural environments and agriculture, there have been few attempts to unite the existing plant-pollinator interaction datasets into a single depository using a common format. Accordingly, we have created one of the world's first online, open-access, and searchable pollinator-plant interaction databases. DoPI (The Database of Pollinator Interactions) was built from a systematic review of the scientific literature and unpublished datasets requested from researchers and organizations. We collated records of interactions between British plant and insect flower-visitor species (or genera), together with associated metadata (date, location, habitat, source publication) when available. The dataset currently (December 2021) contains 101,539 records, detailing over 320,000 interactions. The number of interactions (i.e., the number of times a pairwise species interaction was recorded per occasion) varies considerably among records, averaging 3.6. These include records from 1888 pollinator species and 1241 plant species, totaling >17,000 pairwise species interactions. By combining a large volume of information in a single repository, DoPI can be used to answer fundamental ecological questions on the dynamics of pollination interactions in space and time, as well as applied questions in conservation practice. We hope this dynamic database will be a useful tool not only for researchers, but also for conservationists, funding agencies, governmental departments, beekeepers, agronomists, and gardeners.

37523674,JustRNA: a database of plant long noncoding RNA expression profiles and functional network.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are regulatory RNAs involved in numerous biological processes. Many plant lncRNAs have been identified, but their regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. A resource that enables the investigation of lncRNA activity under various conditions is required because the co-expression between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes may reveal the effects of lncRNAs. This study developed JustRNA, an expression profiling resource for plant lncRNAs. The platform currently contains 1 088 565 lncRNA annotations for 80 plant species. In addition, it includes 3692 RNA-seq samples derived from 825 conditions in six model plants. Functional network reconstruction provides insight into the regulatory roles of lncRNAs. Genomic association analysis and microRNA target prediction can be employed to depict potential interactions with nearby genes and microRNAs, respectively. Subsequent co-expression analysis can be employed to strengthen confidence in the interactions among genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data of transcription factors and histone modifications were integrated into the JustRNA platform to identify the transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs in several plant species.

Interactive visualization of tissue-specific eQTLs or splice QTLs (sQTLs) can facilitate our understanding of functional variants relevant to disease-related traits. However, combining the multi-dimensional nature of eQTLs/sQTLs into a concise and informative visualization is challenging. Existing QTL visualization tools provide useful ways to summarize the unprecedented scale of transcriptomic data but are not necessarily tailored to answer questions about the functional interpretations of trait-associated variants or other variants of interest. We developed FIVEx, an interactive eQTL/sQTL browser with an intuitive interface tailored to the functional interpretation of associated variants. It features the ability to navigate seamlessly between different data views while providing relevant tissue- and locus-specific information to offer users a better understanding of population-scale multi-tissue transcriptomic profiles.

One such environmental factor is ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is part of the physical component of the exposome. UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer and is a significant global health concern. A large body of published research has been conducted to uncover the mechanisms underlying the adverse outcomes of UV radiation exposure on living beings. These studies involve identifying the biomolecules induced upon UV radiation exposure. A few previous efforts have attempted to compile this information in the form of a database, but such earlier efforts have certain limitations. To fill this gap, we present a structured database named UVREK (<b>U</b>ltra<b>V</b>iolet <b>R</b>adiation <b>E</b>xpression <b>K</b>nowledgebase), containing manually curated data on biomolecules induced by UV radiation exposure from the published literature. UVREK has compiled information on 985 genes, 470 proteins, 54 metabolites, and 77 miRNAs along with their metadata. Thereafter, an enrichment analysis performed on the human gene set of the UVREK database showed the importance of transcription-related processes in UV-related response and enrichment of pathways involved in cancer and aging. While significantly contributing toward characterizing the physical component of the exposome, we expect that the compiled data in UVREK will serve as a valuable resource for the development of better UV protection mechanisms such as UV sensors and sunscreens.

36950350,PlantLTRdb: An interactive database for 195 plant species LTR-retrotransposons.,"LTR-retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are a large group of transposable elements that replicate through an RNA intermediate and alter genome structure. The activities of LTR-RTs in plant genomes provide helpful information about genome evolution and gene function. LTR-RTs near or within genes can directly alter gene function. This work introduces PlantLTRdb, an intact LTR-RT database for 195 plant species. Using homology- and <i>de novo</i> structure-based methods, a total of 150.18 Gbp representing 3,079,469 pseudomolecules/scaffolds were analyzed to identify, characterize, annotate LTR-RTs, estimate insertion ages, detect LTR-RT-gene chimeras, and determine nearby genes. Accordingly, 520,194 intact LTR-RTs were discovered, including 29,462 autonomous and 490,732 nonautonomous LTR-RTs. The autonomous LTR-RTs included 10,286 <i>Gypsy</i> and 19,176 <i>Copia</i>, while the nonautonomous were divided into 224,906 <i>Gypsy</i>, 218,414 <i>Copia</i>, 1,768 BARE-2, 3,147 TR-GAG and 4,2497 unknown. Analysis of the identified LTR-RTs located within genes showed that a total of 36,236 LTR-RTs were LTR-RT-gene chimeras and 11,619 LTR-RTs were within pseudo-genes. In addition, 50,026 genes are within 1 kbp of LTR-RTs, and 250,587 had a distance of 1 to 10 kbp from LTR-RTs. PlantLTRdb allows researchers to search, visualize, BLAST and analyze plant LTR-RTs.

In plants, Snf2 is involved in growth, development, as well as stress resistance. However, only a very limited number of experimentally validated Snf2 have been identified and reported, while the majority remaining undiscovered in most species . In this study, we predicted 3135 Snf2 proteins and 8398 chromatin remodeling complex (CRC) subunits in diverse plant species, and constructed the Plant Chromatin Remodeling Factors Database (PlantCHRs, http://www.functionalgenomics.cn/PlantCHRs/), which provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to access information about plant CHRs. We also developed an online tool capable of predicting CHRs and CRC subunits. Moreover, we investigated the distribution of Snf2 proteins in different species and observed a significant increase in the number of Snf2 proteins and the diversity of the Snf2 subfamily during the evolution, highlighting their evolutionary importance. By analyzing the expression patterns of the Snf2 genes in different tissues of maize and <i>Arabidopsis</i>, we found that the Snf2 proteins may show some conservation across different species in regulating plant growth and development.

In Spain, genetic diagnostic laboratories have traditionally approached this task independently due to the lack of a dedicated resource. Here we present SpadaHC, a web-based database for sharing variants in hereditary cancer genes in the Spanish population. SpadaHC is implemented using a three-tier architecture consisting of a relational database, a web tool and a bioinformatics pipeline. Contributing laboratories can share variant classifications and variants from individuals in Variant Calling Format (VCF) format. The platform supports open and restricted access, flexible dataset submissions, automatic pseudo-anonymization, VCF quality control, variant normalization and liftover between genome builds. Users can flexibly explore and search data, receive automatic discrepancy notifications and access SpadaHC population frequencies based on many criteria. In February 2024, SpadaHC included 18 laboratory members, storing 1.17 million variants from 4306 patients and 16 343 laboratory classifications. In the first analysis of the shared data, we identified 84 genetic variants with clinically relevant discrepancies in their classifications and addressed them through a three-phase resolution strategy.

36147666,PeakCNV: A multi-feature ranking algorithm-based tool for genome-wide copy number variation-association study.,"Copy Number Variation (CNV) refers to a type of structural genomic alteration in which a segment of chromosome is duplicated or deleted. To date, many CNVs have been identified as causative genetic elements for several diseases and phenotypes. However, performing a CNV-based genome-wide association study is challenging due to inconsistency in length and occurrence of CNVs across different individuals under investigation. One of the most efficient strategies to address this issue is building CNV regions (genomic regions in which CNVs are overlapping - CNVRs). However, this approach is susceptible to a high false positive rate due to overlapping and co-occurring of confounding CNVRs with true positive CNVRs. Here, we develop PeakCNV that differentiates false-positive CNVRs from true positives by calculating a new metric, independence ranking score, (IR-score) via a feature ranking approach. We compared the performance of PeakCNV with other current existing tools by carrying out two case studies one using the CNV genotype data for individuals with prostate cancer (194 cases and 2,392 healthy individuals) and the second one for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (19,642 cases and 6,451 healthy individuals). Crucially, our benchmarking analyses on prostate cancer cohort indicated that PeakCNV identifies a fewer risk candidate CNVRs with shorter lengths compared to other tools. Importantly, these CNVRs cover a greater proportion of case over healthy individuals compared to other tools. The accuracy of PeakCNV in identifying relevant candidate CNVRs was reproducible in the case study on neurodevelopmental disorders. Using data from the FANTOM5 expression atlas and the Clinical Genomic Database, we show that the candidate CNVRs identified by PeakCNV for neurodevelopmental disorders overlap with a greater number of genes with the brain-enriched expression, and a greater number of genes that are associated with neurological conditions compared to candidate CNVRs identified by other tools. Taken together, PeakCNV outperformed current existing CNV association study tools by identifying more biologically meaningful CNVRs relevant to the phenotype of interest.

37311148,GeniePool: genomic database with corresponding annotated samples based on a cloud data lake architecture.,"In recent years, there are a huge influx of genomic data and a growing need for its phenotypic correlations, yet existing genomic databases do not allow easy storage and accessibility to the combined phenotypic-genotypic information. Freely accessible allele frequency (AF) databases, such as gnomAD, are crucial for evaluating variants but lack correlated phenotype data. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accumulates hundreds of thousands of next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples tagged by their submitters and various attributes. However, samples are stored in large raw format files, inaccessible for a common user. To make thousands of NGS samples and their corresponding additional attributes easily available to clinicians and researchers, we generated a pipeline that continuously downloads raw human NGS data uploaded to SRA using SRAtoolkit and preprocesses them using GATK pipeline. Data are then stored efficiently in a cloud data lake and can be accessed via a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API) and a user-friendly website. We thus generated GeniePool, a simple and intuitive web service and API for querying NGS data from SRA with direct access to information related to each sample and related studies, providing significant advantages over existing databases for both clinical and research usages.

37311149,Neodb: a comprehensive neoantigen database and discovery platform for cancer immunotherapy.,"Neoantigens derived from somatic deoxyribonucleic acid alterations are ideal cancer-specific targets. However, integrated platform for neoantigen discovery is urgently needed. Recently, many scattered experimental evidences suggest that some neoantigens are immunogenic, and comprehensive collection of these experimentally validated neoantigens is still lacking. Here, we have integrated the commonly used tools in the current neoantigen discovery process to form a comprehensive web-based analysis platform. To identify experimental evidences supporting the immunogenicity of neoantigens, we performed comprehensive literature search and constructed the database. The collection of public neoantigens was obtained by using comprehensive features to filter the potential neoantigens from recurrent driver mutations. Importantly, we constructed a graph neural network (GNN) model (Immuno-GNN) using an attention mechanism to consider the spatial interactions between human leukocyte antigen and antigenic peptides for neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. The new easy-to-use R/Shiny web-based neoantigen database and discovery platform, Neodb, contains currently the largest number of experimentally validated neoantigens. In addition to validated neoantigen, Neodb also includes three additional modules for facilitating neoantigen prediction and analysis, including 'Tools' module (comprehensive neoantigen prediction tools); 'Driver-Neo' module (collection of public neoantigens derived from recurrent mutations) and 'Immuno-GNN' module (a novel immunogenicity prediction tool based on a GNN). Immuno-GNN shows improved performance compared with known methods and also represents the first application of GNN model in neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. The construction of Neodb will facilitate the study of neoantigen immunogenicity and the clinical application of neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy.

These structures contain double-helical regions, which often have different types of non-canonical base pairs in addition to Watson-Crick base pairs. Hence, it is important to study their structures from experimentally obtained or even predicted ones, to understand their role, or to develop a drug against the potential targets. Molecular Modeling of RNA double helices containing non-canonical base pairs is a difficult process, particularly due to the unavailability of structural features of non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Here we show a composite web-server with an associated database that allows one to generate the structure of RNA double helix containing non-canonical base pairs using consensus parameters obtained from the database. The database classification is followed by an evaluation of the central tendency of the structural parameters as well as a quantitative estimation of interaction strengths. These parameters are used to construct three-dimensional structures of double helices composed of Watson-Crick and/or non-canonical base pairs. Our benchmark study to regenerate double-helical fragments of many experimentally derived RNA structures indicate very high accuracy.

However, changes in blood RNA and their clinical relevance remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an RNA profile based on 1468 blood samples from both human and mouse studies, which include bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microRNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq data. We developed a comprehensive analysis pipeline that conducted over 11 million comparisons and correlations to identify more than 20,000 blood features. With these findings, we established a blood RNA database related to Alzheimer's disease, RNAs in Blood of AD (RBAD, http://www.bioinform.cn/RBAD/). Using RBAD, we initially validated well-established Alzheimer's disease-related pathways, including olfactory transduction. We then observed a decrease in both the proportion and functionality of erythroid cells, likely attributed to their elevated CD45 levels and interactions with GZMK+CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, we identified 449 blood RNAs linked to patients' overall survival, along with two mRNAs (H4C3 and CTU1) associated with cognitive decline. In summary, RBAD is the first web-based analysis platform dedicated to investigating blood RNA changes in Alzheimer's disease, and provides valuable insights into potential peripheral biomarkers and pathogenic mechanisms related to Alzheimer's disease.",True,False,4.0,,,rbad,16.0,ok,,http://www.bioinform.cn/rbad/ | rnas in blood of ad,,spacy,0.0,RBAD,True,5.0,True,True,http://www.bioinform.cn/RBAD/,http://www.bioinform.cn/RBAD/,True,"...o Alzheimer's disease, RNAs in Blood of AD (RBAD, http://www.bioinform.cn/RBAD/).

40113206,SERS-ATB: A comprehensive database server for antibiotic SERS spectral visualization and deep-learning identification.,"The rapid and accurate identification of antibiotics in environmental samples is critical for addressing the growing concern of antibiotic pollution, particularly in water sources. Antibiotic contamination poses a significant risk to ecosystems and human health by contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), known for its high sensitivity and specificity, is a powerful tool for antibiotic identification. However, its broader application is constrained by the lack of a large-scale antibiotic spectral database crucial for environmental and clinical use. To address this need, we systematically collected 12,800 SERS spectra for 200 environmentally relevant antibiotics and developed an open-access, web-based database at http://sers.test.bniu.net/. We compared six machine learning algorithms with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which achieved the highest accuracy at 98.94%, making it the preferred database model. For external validation, CNN demonstrated an accuracy of 82.8%, underscoring its reliability and practicality for real-world applications. The SERS database and CNN prediction model represent a novel resource for environmental monitoring, offering significant advantages in terms of accessibility, speed, and scalability.

38818975,CropMetabolome: a comprehensive metabolome database for major crops cross eight categories.,"Chemical compositions of crops are of great agronomical importance, as crops serve as resources for nutrition, energy, and medicines for human and livestock. For crop metabolomics research, the lack of crop reference metabolome and high-quality reference compound mass spectra, as well as utilities for metabolic profiling, has hindered the discovery and functional study of phytochemicals in crops. To meet these challenging needs, we have developed the Crop Metabolome database (abbreviated as CropMetabolome) that is dedicated to the construction of crop reference metabolome, repository, and dissemination of crop metabolomic data, and profiling and analytic tools for metabolomics research. CropMetabolome contains a metabolomics database for more than 50 crops (belonging to eight categories) that integrated self-generated raw mass spectral data and public-source datasets. The reference metabolome for 59 crop species was constructed, which have functions that parallel those of reference genome in genomic studies. CropMetabolome also contains 'Standard compound mass spectral library', 'Flavonoids library', 'Pesticide library', and a set of related analytical tools that enable metabolic profiling based on a reference metabolome (CropRefMetaBlast), annotation and identification of new metabolites (CompoundLibBlast), deducing the structure of novel flavonoid derivatives (FlavoDiscover), and detecting possible residual pesticides in crop samples (PesticiDiscover). In addition, CropMetabolome is a repository to share and disseminate metabolomics data and a platform to promote collaborations to develop reference metabolome for more crop species.

36803795,GENECI: A novel evolutionary machine learning consensus-based approach for the inference of gene regulatory networks.,"Gene regulatory networks define the interactions between DNA products and other substances in cells. Increasing knowledge of these networks improves the level of detail with which the processes that trigger different diseases are described and fosters the development of new therapeutic targets. These networks are usually represented by graphs, and the primary sources for their correct construction are usually time series from differential expression data. The inference of networks from this data type has been approached differently in the literature. Mostly, computational learning techniques have been implemented, which have finally shown some specialization in specific datasets. For this reason, the need arises to create new and more robust strategies for reaching a consensus based on previous results to gain a particular capacity for generalization. This paper presents GENECI (GEne NEtwork Consensus Inference), an evolutionary machine learning approach that acts as an organizer for constructing ensembles to process the results of the main inference techniques reported in the literature and to optimize the consensus network derived from them, according to their confidence levels and topological characteristics. After its design, the proposal was confronted with datasets collected from academic benchmarks (DREAM challenges and IRMA network) to quantify its accuracy. Subsequently, it was applied to a real-world biological network of melanoma patients whose results could be contrasted with medical research collected in the literature. Finally, it has been proved that its ability to optimize the consensus of several networks leads to outstanding robustness and accuracy, gaining a certain generalization capacity after facing the inference of multiple datasets.

However, identifying these elements from assembled reads remains challenging due to genome sequence plasticity and the difficulty in assembling complete sequences. In this study, we developed a classifier, using random forest, to identify whether sequences originated from bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, or bacteriophages. The classifier was trained on a diverse collection of 23,211 chromosomal, plasmid, and bacteriophage sequences from hundreds of bacterial species. In order to adapt the classifier to incomplete sequences, each complete sequence was subsampled into 5,000 nucleotide fragments and further subdivided into <i>k</i>-mers.

Dense granule proteins (GRAs), specific to the Apicomplexa, participate in the maintenance of intracellular parasitism of host cells. GRAs have better immunogenicity and they can be emerged as important players in vaccine development. Although studies on GRAs have increased gradually in recent years, due to incompleteness and complexity of data collection, biologists have difficulty in the comprehensive utilization of information. Thus, there is a desperate need of user-friendly resource to integrate with existing GRAs. In this paper, we developed the Dense Granule Protein Database (DGPD), the first knowledge database dedicated to the integration and analysis of typical GRAs properties. The current version of DGPD includes annotated GRAs metadata of 245 samples derived from multiple web repositories and literature mining, involving five species that cause common diseases (Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, Hammondia hammondi, Neospora caninum and Cystoisospora suis).

The accompanying metadata describing the experiments suffer from redundancy, inconsistency and incompleteness due to the prevalence of free text and the lack of well-defined data formats and their validation. To remedy this situation, we created Genomic Metadata Integration (GeMI; http://gmql.eu/gemi/), a web application that learns to automatically extract structured metadata (in the form of key-value pairs) from the plain text descriptions of GEO experiments. The extracted information can then be indexed for structured search and used for various downstream data mining activities. GeMI works in continuous interaction with its users. The natural language processing transformer-based model at the core of our system is a fine-tuned version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT2) model that is able to learn continuously from the feedback of the users thanks to an active learning framework designed for the purpose. As a part of such a framework, a machine learning interpretation mechanism (that exploits saliency maps) allows the users to understand easily and quickly whether the predictions of the model are correct and improves the overall usability. GeMI's ability to extract attributes not explicitly mentioned (such as sex, tissue type, cell type, ethnicity and disease) allows researchers to perform specific queries and classification of experiments, which was previously possible only after spending time and resources with tedious manual annotation.

35411388,PASS2.7: a database containing structure-based sequence alignments and associated features of protein domain superfamilies from SCOPe.,"Sequence alignments are models that capture the structural, functional and evolutionary relationships between proteins. Structure-guided sequence alignments are helpful in the case of distantly related proteins with poor sequence identity, thus rendering routine sequence alignment methods ineffective. Protein Alignment organized as Structural Superfamilies or PASS2 database provides such sequence alignments of protein domains within a superfamily as per the Structural Classification of Proteins extended (SCOPe) database. The current update of PASS2 (i.e. PASS2.7) is following the latest release of SCOPe (2.07) and we provide data for 14 323 protein domains that are <40% identical and are organized into 2024 superfamilies. Several useful features derived from the alignments, such as conserved secondary structural motifs, HMMs and residues conserved across the superfamily, are also reported. Protein domains that are deviant from the rest of the members of a superfamily may compromise the quality of the alignment, and we found this to be the case in ∼7% of the total superfamilies we considered. To improve the alignment by objectively identifying such 'outliers', in this update, we have used a k-means-based unsupervised machine learning method for clustering superfamily members, where features provided were length of domains aligned, Cα-RMSD derived from the rigid-body superposition of all members and gaps contributed to the alignment by each domain. In a few cases, we have split the superfamily as per the clusters predicted and provided complete data for each cluster. A new feature included in this update is absolutely conserved interactions (ACIs) between residue backbones and side chains, which are obtained by aligning protein structure networks using structure-guided sequence alignments of superfamilies. ACIs provide valuable information about functionally important residues and the structure-function relationships of proteins. The ACIs and the corresponding conserved networks for backbone and sidechain have been marked on the superimposed structure separately.<h4>Database url</h4>The updated version of the PASS2 database is available at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/.",True,False,4.0,,,pass2.7 | scope | pass2,16.0,conflict,,a database containing structure-based sequence alignments and associated features of protein domain superfamilies from | protein alignment organized as structural superfamilies or | structural classification of proteins,,spacy,0.0,PASS2.,True,5.0,False,False,http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/,http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/,True,...ted version of the PASS2 database is available at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/.,1

Its main purposes are to increase the reusability and accessibility of human gut metagenomic data, and enable cross-project and phenotype comparisons. To achieve these goals, we performed manual curation on the meta-data and organized the datasets in a phenotype-centric manner. GMrepo v2 contains 353 projects and 71,642 runs/samples, which are significantly increased from the previous version. Among these runs/samples, 45,111 and 26,531 were obtained by 16S rRNA amplicon and whole-genome metagenomics sequencing, respectively. We also increased the number of phenotypes from 92 to 133. In addition, we introduced disease-marker identification and cross-project/phenotype comparison. We first identified disease markers between two phenotypes (e.g. health versus diseases) on a per-project basis for selected projects. We then compared the identified markers for each phenotype pair across datasets to facilitate the identification of consistent microbial markers across datasets. Finally, we provided a marker-centric view to allow users to check if a marker has different trends in different diseases. So far, GMrepo includes 592 marker taxa (350 species and 242 genera) for 47 phenotype pairs, identified from 83 selected projects.

34788852,dbPTM in 2022: an updated database for exploring regulatory networks and functional associations of protein post-translational modifications.,"Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play an important role in different cellular processes. In view of the importance of PTMs in cellular functions and the massive data accumulated by the rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, this paper presents an update of dbPTM with over 2 777 000 PTM substrate sites obtained from existing databases and manual curation of literature, of which more than 2 235 000 entries are experimentally verified. This update has manually curated over 42 new modification types that were not included in the previous version. Due to the increasing number of studies on the mechanism of PTMs in the past few years, a great deal of upstream regulatory proteins of PTM substrate sites have been revealed. The updated dbPTM thus collates regulatory information from databases and literature, and merges them into a protein-protein interaction network. To enhance the understanding of the association between PTMs and molecular functions/cellular processes, the functional annotations of PTMs are curated and integrated into the database. In addition, the existing PTM-related resources, including annotation databases and prediction tools are also renewed.

36968016,ESCCdb: A comprehensive database and key regulator exploring platform based on cross dataset comparisons for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Esophageal cancer is the seventh most prevalent and the sixth most lethal cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the major esophageal cancer subtypes that accounts for 87 % of the total cases. However, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present an integrated database for ESCC called ESCCdb, which includes a total of 56 datasets and published studies from the GEO, Xena or SRA databases and related publications. It helps users to explore a particular gene with multiple graphical and interactive views with one click. The results comprise expression changes across 20 datasets, copy number alterations in 11 datasets, somatic mutations from 12 papers, related drugs derived from DGIdb, related pathways, and gene correlations. ESCCdb enables directly cross-dataset comparison of a gene's mutations, expressions and copy number changes in multiple datasets. This allows users to easily assess the alterations in ESCC. Furthermore, survival analysis, drug-gene relationships, and results from whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screening can help users determine the clinical relevance, derive functional inferences, and identify potential drugs. Notably, ESCCdb also enables the exploration of the correlation structure and identification of potential key regulators for a process. Finally, we identified 789 consistently differential expressed genes; we summarized recurrently mutated genes and genes affected by significant copy number alterations. These genes may be stable biomarkers or important players during ESCC development.

37639797,HMDB: A curated database of genes involved in hydrocarbon monooxygenation reaction with homologous genes as background.,"The investigation of hydrocarbon degradation potential of environmental microorganisms is an important research topic, whether for the global carbon cycle or oil pollution remediation. Under aerobic conditions, the microorganisms employ a range of monooxygenases to use hydrocarbons substrates as a source of carbon and energy. With the explosion of sequencing data, mining genes in genomes or metagenomes has become computationally expensive and time-consuming. We proposed the HMDB, which is a professional gene database of hydrocarbon monooxygenases. HMDB contains 38 genes, which encode 11 monooxygenases responsible for the hydroxylation of 8 hydrocarbons. To reduce false positives, the strategy of using homologous genes as background noise was applied for HMDB. We added 10,095 gene sequences of homologous enzymes which took non-hydrocarbons as substrates to HMDB. The classic BLAST method and best-hit strategy were recommended for HMDB usage, but not limited. The performance of HMDB was validated using 264,402 prokaryote genomes from RefSeq and 51 metagenomes from SRA. The results showed that HMDB database had high sensitivity and low false positive rate. We release the HMDB database here, hoping to speed up the process for investigation of hydrocarbon monooxygenases in massive metagenomic data.

39982792,Integrating AI-powered text mining from PubTator into the manual curation workflow at the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.,"The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a manually curated knowledge- and discovery-base that seeks to advance understanding about the relationship between environmental exposures and human health. CTD's manual curation process extracts from the biomedical literature molecular relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, phenotypes, diseases, anatomical terms, and species. These relationships are organized in a highly systematic way in order to make them not only informative but also scientifically computational, enabling inferential hypotheses to be formed to address gaps in understanding. Integral to CTD's functionality is the use of structured, hierarchical ontologies and controlled vocabularies to describe these molecular relationships. Normalizing text (i.e. translating raw text from the literature into these controlled vocabularies) can be a time-consuming process for biocurators. To facilitate the normalization process and improve the efficiency with which our scientists curate the literature, CTD evaluated and integrated into the curation process PubTator 3.0, a state-of-the-art, AI-powered resource which extracts and normalizes from the literature many of the key biomedical concepts CTD curates.

However, small-RNA sequencing data were rarely used. Using TCGA miRNA sequencing data, we evaluated bacterial abundance in 32 types of cancer. To uncover the bacteria involved in cancer, we applied an analytical process to align unmapped human reads to bacterial references and developed the BIC database for the transcriptional landscape of bacteria in cancer. BIC provides cancer-associated bacterial information, including the relative abundance of bacteria, bacterial diversity, associations with clinical relevance, the co-expression network of bacteria and human genes, and their associated biological functions. These results can complement previously published databases. Users can easily download the result plots and tables, or download the bacterial abundance matrix for further analyses. In summary, BIC can provide information on cancer microenvironments related to microbial communities.

Different physical and biochemical representations can be used to describe PLI such as energy terms and interaction fingerprints, which can be analyzed by machine learning (ML) algorithms to create ML-based scoring functions (MLSFs). Here, we propose the ML-based PLI capturer (ML-PLIC), a web platform that automatically characterizes PLI and generates MLSFs to identify the potential binders of a specific protein target through virtual screening (VS). ML-PLIC comprises five modules, including Docking for ligand docking, Descriptors for PLI generation, Modeling for MLSF training, Screening for VS and Pipeline for the integration of the aforementioned functions. We validated the MLSFs constructed by ML-PLIC in three benchmark datasets (Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced, Active as Decoys and TocoDecoy), demonstrating accuracy outperforming traditional docking tools and competitive performance to the deep learning-based SF, and provided a case study of the Serine/threonine-protein kinase WEE1 in which MLSFs were developed by using the ML-based VS pipeline in ML-PLIC.

A comprehensive dataset of TG-43 parameters is compiled, including detailed source descriptions, dose-rate constants, radial dose functions, 1D and 2D anisotropy functions, along-away dose-rate tables, Primary and Scatter Separated (PSS) dose tables, and mean photon energies escaping each source. The database also documents the source models which are freely distributed with egs_brachy.<h4>Acquisition and validation methods</h4>Datasets are calculated after a recoding of the source geometries using the egs++ geometry package and its egs_brachy extensions. Air kerma per history is calculated in a 10   ×  10  ×  $\,{\times}\, 10\,{\times}\,$  0.05 cm<sup>3</sup> voxel located 100 cm from the source along the transverse axis and then corrected for the lateral and thickness dimensions of the scoring voxel to give the air kerma on the central axis at a point 100 cm from the source's mid-point. Full-scatter water phantoms with varying voxel resolutions in cylindrical coordinates are used for dose calculations. Most data (except for <sup>60</sup> Co) are based on the assumption of charged particle equilibrium and ignore the potentially large effects of electron transport very close to the source and dose from initial beta particles. These effects are evaluated for four representative sources. For validation, data are compared to those from CLRP_TG43v1 and published data.<h4>Data format and access</h4>Data are available at https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/egs_brachy/seed_database_v2 or http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/tg43v2 including in Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheets, and are presented graphically in comparisons to previously published data for each source.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The CLRP_TG43v2 database has applications in research, dosimetry, and brachytherapy planning.

Genetic variations in pathways influencing cobalamin absorption, transport, and metabolism can affect various direct and indirect measures of vitamin B12 status. To facilitate a structured approach to studying these genetic factors, we aimed to systematically curate and create a user-friendly web database that offers comprehensive data on genetic variants influencing B12 biomarkers. A PubMed search was performed for 5 B12 traits [total serum/plasma B12, holotranscobalamin (active B12), total transcobalamin, holohaptocorrin, and methylmalonic acid] resulting in 493 research publications, of which 47 relevant publications were reviewed further. The database backend was built using MongoDB and the web interface was coded in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on an Apache HTTP server. We have manually curated and compiled the Cobalamin Associated Genetic Variant (CobVar) database, comprising a total of 324 genetic variant associations for 5 different vitamin B12 traits involving 222 unique genetic variants and 84 genes identified across several genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies.

35936325,Development and Evaluation of a Sound-Swapped Video Database for Misophonia.,"Misophonia has been characterized as intense negative reactions to specific trigger sounds (often orofacial sounds like chewing, sniffling, or slurping). However, recent research suggests high-level, contextual, and multisensory factors are also involved. We recently demonstrated that neurotypicals' negative reactions to aversive sounds (e.g., nails scratching a chalkboard) are attenuated when the sounds are synced with <i>positive attributable video sources</i> (PAVS; e.g., tearing a piece of paper). To assess whether this effect generalizes to misophonic triggers, we developed a Sound-Swapped Video (SSV) database for use in misophonia research. In Study 1, we created a set of 39 video clips depicting common trigger sounds (<i>original video sources</i>, OVS) and a corresponding set of 39 PAVS temporally synchronized with the OVS videos. In Study 2, participants (<i>N</i> = 34) rated the 39 PAVS videos for their audiovisual match and pleasantness. We selected the 20 PAVS videos with best match scores for use in Study 3. In Study 3, a new group of participants (<i>n</i> = 102) observed the 20 selected PAVS and 20 corresponding OVS and judged the pleasantness or unpleasantness of each sound in the two contexts accompanying each video. Afterward, participants completed the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ). The results of Study 3 show a robust attenuating effect of PAVS videos on the reported unpleasantness of trigger sounds: trigger sounds were rated as significantly less unpleasant when paired with PAVS with than OVS. Moreover, this attenuating effect was present in nearly every participant (99 out of 102) regardless of their score on the MQ. In fact, we found a moderate positive correlation between the PAVS-OVS difference and misophonia severity scores. Overall our results provide validation that the SSV database is a useful stimulus database to study how misophonic responses can be modulated by visual contexts. Here, we release the SSV database with the best 18 PAVS and 18 OVS videos used in Study 3 along with aggregate ratings of audio-video match and pleasantness (https://osf.io/3ysfh/).

40343630,sCentInDB: a database of essential oil chemical profiles of Indian medicinal plants.,"Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile compounds produced by aromatic plants and widely used in personal care, food flavoring, and pharmaceutical industry due to their odor and therapeutic properties. As a high-value and low-volume organic product, optimizing plant yield and modifying composition by leveraging knowledge on chemical profiles of essential oils can lead to enhanced bioproducts. Additionally, overharvesting of wild medicinal plants, especially in India, threatens biodiversity. Essential oil profiles of such plants can help regulate their exploitation. Here, we present sCentInDB, a manually curated FAIR-compliant DataBase of Essential oil Chemical profiles of Medicinal plants of India, compiled from published literature. sCentInDB contains data on 554 Indian medicinal plants at the plant part level, encompassing 2170 essential oil profiles, 3420 chemicals, 471 plant-part-therapeutic use associations, 120 plant-part-odor associations, and 218 plant-part-color associations. sCentInDB also compiles metadata such as sample location, isolation, and analysis methods. Subsequently, an extensive analysis of the chemical space in sCentInDB was performed. By constructing a chemical similarity network, terpenoids were found to be distributed across the network, indicating greater structural diversity. Moreover, a comparison of the scaffold diversity of chemicals in sCentInDB was performed against three other aroma libraries using cyclic system retrieval curves. Altogether, sCentInDB will serve as a valuable resource for researchers working on plant volatiles and employing genetic engineering to enhance oil yield and composition.

38164624,AptaDB: a comprehensive database integrating aptamer-target interactions.,"Aptamers have emerged as research hotspots of the next generation due to excellent performance benefits and application potentials in pharmacology, medicine, and analytical chemistry. Despite the numerous aptamer investigations, the lack of comprehensive data integration has hindered the development of computational methods for aptamers and the reuse of aptamers. A public access database named AptaDB, derived from experimentally validated data manually collected from the literature, was hence developed, integrating comprehensive aptamer-related data, which include six key components: (i) experimentally validated aptamer-target interaction information, (ii) aptamer property information, (iii) structure information of aptamer, (iv) target information, (v) experimental activity information, and (vi) algorithmically calculated similar aptamers. AptaDB currently contains 1350 experimentally validated aptamer-target interactions, 1230 binding affinity constants, 1293 aptamer sequences, and more. Compared to other aptamer databases, it contains twice the number of entries found in available databases. The collection and integration of the above information categories is unique among available aptamer databases and provides a user-friendly interface. AptaDB will also be continuously updated as aptamer research evolves. We expect that AptaDB will become a powerful source for aptamer rational design and a valuable tool for aptamer screening in the future.

40343712,GenDiS3 database: census on the prevalence of protein domain superfamilies of known structure in the entire sequence database.,"Despite the vast amount of sequence data available, a significant disparity exists between the number of protein sequences identified and the relatively few structures that have been resolved. This disparity highlights the challenge in structural biology to bridge the gap between sequence information and 3D structural data, and the necessity for robust databases capable of linking distant homologs to known structures. Studies have indicated that there are a limited number of structural folds, despite the vast diversity of proteins. Hence, computational tools can enhance our ability to classify protein sequences, much before their structures are determined or their functions are characterized, thereby bridging the gap between sequence and structural data. GenDiS (Genomic Distribution of Superfamilies) is a repository with information on the genomic distribution of protein domain superfamilies, involving a one-time computational exercise to search for trusted homologs of protein domains of known structures against the vast sequence database. We have updated this database employing advanced bioinformatics tools, including DELTA-BLAST (domain enhanced lookup time accelerated BLAST) for initial detection of hits and HMMSCAN for validation, significantly improving the accuracy of domain identification. Using these tools, over 151 million sequence homologs for 2060 superfamilies [SCOPe (Structural Classification of Proteins extended)] were identified and 116 million out of them were validated as true positives. Through a case study on glycolysis-related enzymes, variations in domain architectures of these enzymes are explored, revealing evolutionary changes and functional diversity among these essential proteins. We present another case, LOG gene, where one can tune in and find significant mutations across the evolutionary lineage.

38181047,sc2MeNetDrug: A computational tool to uncover inter-cell signaling targets and identify relevant drugs based on single cell RNA-seq data.,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology to investigate the transcriptional programs in stromal, immune, and disease cells, like tumor cells or neurons within the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brain or tumor microenvironment (ME) or niche. Cell-cell communications within ME play important roles in disease progression and immunotherapy response and are novel and critical therapeutic targets. Though many tools of scRNA-seq analysis have been developed to investigate the heterogeneity and sub-populations of cells, few were designed for uncovering cell-cell communications of ME and predicting the potentially effective drugs to inhibit the communications. Moreover, the data analysis processes of discovering signaling communication networks and effective drugs using scRNA-seq data are complex and involve a set of critical analysis processes and external supportive data resources, which are difficult for researchers who have no strong computational background and training in scRNA-seq data analysis. To address these challenges, in this study, we developed a novel open-source computational tool, sc2MeNetDrug (https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/). It was specifically designed using scRNA-seq data to identify cell types within disease MEs, uncover the dysfunctional signaling pathways within individual cell types and interactions among different cell types, and predict effective drugs that can potentially disrupt cell-cell signaling communications. sc2MeNetDrug provided a user-friendly graphical user interface to encapsulate the data analysis modules, which can facilitate the scRNA-seq data-based discovery of novel inter-cell signaling communications and novel therapeutic regimens.",True,False,4.5,,sc2menetdrug,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,sc2MeNetDrug,False,0.0,True,False,https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/,https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/,True,"...vel open-source computational tool, sc2MeNetDrug (https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/).

In order to make full use of large-scale sequencing data and help researchers in related fields to achieve high-throughput functional verification of identified plant introns with functional elements, we designed a database containing five plant species, PlantIntronDB and systematically analyzed 358, 59, 185, 210 and 141 RNA-seq samples from Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Gossypium raimondii (cotton), Zea mays (maize), Brassica napus (oilseed rape) and Oryza sativa Japonica Group (rice). In total, we found 100 126 introns that host functional elements in these five species. Specifically, we found that among all species, the number of introns with functional elements on the positive and negative strands is similar, with a length mostly smaller than 1500 bp, and the Adenine/Thymine (A/T) content is much higher than that of Guanine/Cytosine (G/C). In addition, the distribution of functional elements in introns varies among different species. All the above data can be downloaded for free in this database. This database provides a concise, comprehensive and user-friendly web interface, allowing users to easily retrieve target data based on their needs, using relevant organizational options.

The data are presented for common virus variants and the most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles. Binding affinities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants.

36509942,Crime Stereotypicality and Severity Database (CriSSD): Subjective norms for 63 crimes.,"The existence of crime-related racial stereotypes has been well documented. People tend to associate certain groups with specific crimes, which, in turn, impacts criminal-sentencing decisions through the perceptions of crime severity. This evidence calls for regular updating of rating norms combining these variables. With this objective, and given that most of the normative studies provide norms for a small number of crimes and/or with an insufficient number of participants, a new norming study was conducted. Furthermore, norms from European countries are absent, and the existing ones (mostly with USA-based populations) do not simultaneously examine crime stereotypicality and crime severity. The Crime Stereotypicality and Severity Database (CriSSD) presents normative ratings for a set of 63 crimes on three dimensions: White stereotypicality, Black stereotypicality, and crime severity. The crimes were selected according to a comprehensive procedure. A total of 340 Portuguese participants (72.6% female; M<sub>age</sub> = 26.86, SD = 7.65) answered an online survey. Each crime was evaluated by a range of 46-60 participants. Data allowed us to identify a crime typology with three clusters. We present descriptive data (means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals) for each crime. Crime evaluations were associated with sociodemographic characteristics. Additionally, this study gives input regarding the understudied link between crime stereotypes and crime severity, showing that crime severity is predicted by ratings of both Black and White stereotypicality.

Many proteins are associated with ferroptosis signal transduction pathways. Novel chemical compounds are demanded to explore and regulate these pathways. Therefore, a ferroptosis ligand database, which holds relations among chemical structures, targets, bioactivities, and diseases, is needed for discovering and designing new ferroptosis regulators. This work reports FerroLigandDB, a manually curated database for small-molecular ferroptosis regulators. The database comprises 466 ferroptosis inducer entries (with 380 unique molecular structures) and 539 ferroptosis inhibitor entries (with 468 unique molecular structures) (note: one compound can be recorded as multiple entries due to the different assays). Each ferroptosis ligand entry is detailed with compound IDs, structure attributes, bioactivity values, test objects, target information, associated diseases, and references. The fields in the FerroLigandDB database implicitly contain relationships among chemical structures, bioactivities, targets, and diseases. Thus, FerroLigandDB is a comprehensive resource for scientists to design and discover novel ferroptosis regulators. The user interface of FerroLigandDB is implemented with query features and data visualization facilities.

Anticipating potential drug's adverse effects in the early stages is necessary to minimize health risks to patients, animal testing, and economical costs. With the constantly increasing size of virtual screening libraries, AI-driven methods can be exploited as first-tier screening tools to provide liability estimation for drug candidates. In this work we present ProfhEX, an AI-driven suite of 46 OECD-compliant machine learning models that can profile small molecules on 7 relevant liability groups: cardiovascular, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, endocrine, renal, pulmonary and immune system toxicities. Experimental affinity data was collected from public and commercial data sources. The entire chemical space comprised 289'202 activity data for a total of 210'116 unique compounds, spanning over 46 targets with dataset sizes ranging from 819 to 18896. Gradient boosting and random forest algorithms were initially employed and ensembled for the selection of a champion model. Models were validated according to the OECD principles, including robust internal (cross validation, bootstrap, y-scrambling) and external validation. Champion models achieved an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.84 (SD of 0.05), an R<sup>2</sup> determination coefficient of 0.68 (SD = 0.1) and a root mean squared error of 0.69 (SD of 0.08). All liability groups showed good hit-detection power with an average enrichment factor at 5% of 13.1 (SD of 4.5) and AUC of 0.92 (SD of 0.05). Benchmarking against already existing tools demonstrated the predictive power of ProfhEX models for large-scale liability profiling.

36329825,'Targeting' the search: An upgraded structural and functional repository of antimicrobial peptides for biofilm studies (B-AMP v2.0) with a focus on biofilm protein targets.,"Bacterial biofilms, often as multispecies communities, are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics, making the treatment of biofilm infections a challenge. There is a push towards developing novel anti-biofilm approaches, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), with activity against specific biofilm targets. In previous work, we developed Biofilm-AMP, a structural and functional repository of AMPs for biofilm studies (B-AMP v1.0) with more than 5000 structural models of AMPs and a vast library of AMP annotations to existing biofilm literature. In this study, we present an upgraded version of B-AMP, with a focus on existing and novel bacterial biofilm targets. B-AMP v2.0 hosts a curated collection of 2502 biofilm protein targets across 473 bacterial species, with structural protein models and functional annotations from PDB, UniProt, and PubMed databases. The biofilm targets can be searched for using the name of the source organism, and function and type of protein, and results include designated Target IDs (unique to B-AMP v2.0), UniProt IDs, 3D predicted protein structures, PDBQT files, pre-defined protein functions, and relevant scientific literature. To present an example of the combined applicability of both, the AMP and biofilm target libraries in the repository, we present two case studies. In the first case study, we expand an <i>in silico</i> pipeline to evaluate AMPs against a single biofilm target in the multidrug resistant, bacterial pathogen <i>Corynebacterium striatum</i>, using 3D protein-peptide docking models from previous work and Molecular Dynamics simulations (~1.2µs).

35592546,The EWAS Catalog: a database of epigenome-wide association studies.,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) seek to quantify associations between traits/exposures and DNA methylation measured at thousands or millions of CpG sites across the genome. In recent years, the increase in availability of DNA methylation measures in population-based cohorts and case-control studies has resulted in a dramatic expansion of the number of EWAS being performed and published. To make this rich source of results more accessible, we have manually curated a database of CpG-trait associations (with p<1x10 <sup>-4</sup>) from published EWAS, each assaying over 100,000 CpGs in at least 100 individuals. From January 7, 2022, The EWAS Catalog contained 1,737,746 associations from 2,686 EWAS. This includes 1,345,398 associations from 342 peer-reviewed publications. In addition, it also contains summary statistics for 392,348 associations from 427 EWAS, performed on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The database is accompanied by a web-based tool and R package, giving researchers the opportunity to query EWAS associations quickly and easily, and gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of disease as well as the impact of traits and exposures on the DNA methylome. The EWAS Catalog data extraction team continue to update the database monthly and we encourage any EWAS authors to upload their summary statistics to our website.

Dysregulated CRE and SCRE activities have been reported to alter the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, thereby regulating cancer hallmarks. To address the strong need for a comprehensive catalogue of dysregulated CREs and SCREs in human cancers, we present TSCRE (http://tscre.zsqylab.com/), an open resource providing tumor-specific and cell type-specific CREs and SCREs derived from the re-analysis of publicly available histone modification profiles. Currently, TSCRE contains 1 864 941 dysregulated CREs and 68 253 dysregulated SCREs identified from 1366 human patient samples spanning 17 different cancer types and 9 histone marks. Over 95% of these elements have been validated in public resources. TSCRE offers comprehensive annotations for each element, including associated genes, expression patterns, clinical prognosis, somatic mutations, transcript factor binding sites, cancer-type specificity, and drug response. Additionally, TSCRE integrates pathway and transcript factor enrichment analyses for each study, enabling in-depth functional and mechanistic investigations.

39197059,MACSFeD-a database of mosquito acoustic communication and swarming features.,"Acoustic communication plays an important role during the courtship of many mosquito species. Male mosquitoes show strong attraction to female wing beat frequencies, mediated via spectral matching between female wing beat frequency and male ear mechanical tuning frequency. Such acoustic communication typically occurs within swarms, male-dominated aggregations with species-specific properties. Despite hundreds of relevant publications being available, the lack of a central platform hosting all associated data hinders research efforts and limits cross-species comparisons. Here, we introduce MACSFeD (Mosquito Acoustic Communication and Swarming Features Database), an interactive platform for the exploration of our comprehensive database containing 251 unique reports focusing on different aspects of mosquito acoustic communication, including hearing function, wing beat frequency and phonotaxis, as well as male swarming parameters.

With the escalating concern regarding antibiotic resistance, there is a pressing need for innovative approaches to combat these pathogens. Repurposing existing drugs offers a promising solution. Our present work hypothesizes that proteins harboring ligand-binding pockets with similar chemical environments may be able to bind the same drug. To facilitate this drug-repurposing strategy against pathogenic bacteria, we introduce an online server, PharmaRedefine. Leveraging a combination of sequence and structure alignment and protein pocket similarity analysis, this platform enables the prediction of potential targets in representative bacteria for specific FDA-approved drugs.

39033257,PMTPred: machine-learning-based prediction of protein methyltransferases using the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs.,"Protein methyltransferases (PMTs) are a group of enzymes that help catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to its substrates. These enzymes play an important role in epigenetic regulation and can methylate various substrates with DNA, RNA, protein, and small-molecule secondary metabolites. Dysregulation of methyltransferases is implicated in various human cancers. However, in light of the well-recognized significance of PMTs, reliable and efficient identification methods are essential. In the present work, we propose a machine-learning-based method for the identification of PMTs. Various sequence-based features were calculated, and prediction models were trained using various machine-learning algorithms using a tenfold cross-validation technique. After evaluating each model on the dataset, the SVM-based CKSAAP model achieved the highest prediction accuracy with balanced sensitivity and specificity. Also, this SVM model outperformed deep-learning algorithms for the prediction of PMTs. In addition, cross-database validation was performed to ensure the robustness of the model. Feature importance was assessed using shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values, providing insights into the contributions of different features to the model's predictions. Finally, the SVM-based CKSAAP model was implemented in a standalone tool, PMTPred, due to its consistent performance during independent testing and cross-database evaluation. We believe that PMTPred will be a useful and efficient tool for the identification of PMTs.

36641216,Visualizing and accessing correlated SAXS data sets with Similarity Maps and Simple Scattering web resources.,"Constructing a comprehensive understanding of macromolecular behavior from a set of correlated small angle scattering (SAS) data is aided by tools that analyze all scattering curves together. SAS experiments on biological systems can be performed on specimens that are more easily prepared, modified, and formatted relative to those of most other techniques. An X-ray SAS measurement (SAXS) can be performed in less than a milli-second in-line with treatment steps such as purification or exposure to modifiers. These capabilities are valuable since biological macromolecules (proteins, polynucleotides, lipids, and carbohydrates) change conformation or assembly under specific conditions that often define their biological role. Furthermore, mutation or post-translational modification change their behavior and provides an avenue to tailor their mechanics. Here, we describe tools to combine multiple correlated SAS measurements for analysis and review their application to biological systems. The SAXS Similarity Map (SSM) compares a set of scattering curves and quantifies the similarity between them for display as a color on a grid. Visualizing an entire correlated data set with SSMs helps identify patterns that reveal biological functions. The SSM analysis is available as a web-based tool at https://sibyls.als.lbl.gov/saxs-similarity/. To make data available and promote tool development, we have also deployed a repository of correlated SAS data sets called Simple Scattering (available at https://simplescattering.com).

While chemical algicides are widely used for HABs control due to their rapid efficacy, the lack of systematic data integration and concerns over environmental toxicity limit their broader application. To address these challenges, we developed AlgicideDB, a manually curated database containing 1,672 algicidal records on 542 algicides targeting 110 algal species. Using this database, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of algicides and proposed an algicide-likeness scoring function to facilitate the exploration of compounds with antialgal properties. Additionally, we evaluated the acute toxicity of algicidal compounds to non-target aquatic organisms of different trophic levels to assess their ecological risks. The platform also incorporates a large language model (LLM) enhanced by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to address HAB-related queries, supporting decision-making and facilitating knowledge dissemination.

The disease is spread by the parasite Leishmania transmitted by sandfly vectors and their primary hosts are vertebrates including humans. The pathogen penetrates host cells and secretes proteins (the secretome) to repurpose cells for pathogen growth and to alter cell signaling via host-pathogen protein-protein interactions). Here, we present LeishMANIAdb, a database specifically designed to investigate how Leishmania virulence factors may interfere with host proteins. Since the secretomes of different Leishmania species are only partially characterized, we collated various experimental evidence and used computational predictions to identify Leishmania secreted proteins to generate a user-friendly unified web resource allowing users to access all information available on experimental and predicted secretomes. In addition, we manually annotated host-pathogen interactions of 211 proteins and the localization/function of 3764 transmembrane (TM) proteins of different Leishmania species. We also enriched all proteins with automatic structural and functional predictions that can provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms of infection.

As a result, efforts have increased to integrate diverse datasets and extract meaning from these measurements. Machine learning models are a powerful tool for gaining knowledge from large and complex datasets. However, these models must be trained on high-quality features to succeed. Currently, there are no solutions to host maize multi-omics datasets with end-to-end solutions for evaluating and linking features to target gene annotations. Our work presents the Maize Feature Store (MFS), a versatile application that combines features built on complex data to facilitate exploration, modeling and analysis. Feature stores allow researchers to rapidly deploy machine learning applications by managing and providing access to frequently used features. We populated the MFS for the maize reference genome with over 14 000 gene-based features based on published genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, variomic and proteomics datasets.

These innovative sequencing techniques empower researchers to dissect perturbation effects in biological systems at an unprecedented resolution. Despite these advancements, a notable gap exists in the availability of a dedicated database for exploring scPerturbation data. To address this gap, we present PerturBase, the most comprehensive database designed for the analysis and visualization of scPerturbation data (http://www.perturbase.cn/).

35133949,"BioPhi: A platform for antibody design, humanization, and humanness evaluation based on natural antibody repertoires and deep learning.","Despite recent advances in transgenic animal models and display technologies, humanization of mouse sequences remains one of the main routes for therapeutic antibody development. Traditionally, humanization is manual, laborious, and requires expert knowledge. Although automation efforts are advancing, existing methods are either demonstrated on a small scale or are entirely proprietary. To predict the immunogenicity risk, the human-likeness of sequences can be evaluated using existing humanness scores, but these lack diversity, granularity or interpretability. Meanwhile, immune repertoire sequencing has generated rich antibody libraries such as the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) that offer augmented diversity not yet exploited for antibody engineering. Here we present BioPhi, an open-source platform featuring novel methods for humanization (Sapiens) and humanness evaluation (OASis). Sapiens is a deep learning humanization method trained on the OAS using language modeling. Based on an <i>in silico</i> humanization benchmark of 177 antibodies, Sapiens produced sequences at scale while achieving results comparable to that of human experts. OASis is a granular, interpretable and diverse humanness score based on 9-mer peptide search in the OAS. OASis separated human and non-human sequences with high accuracy, and correlated with clinical immunogenicity. BioPhi thus offers an antibody design interface with automated methods that capture the richness of natural antibody repertoires to produce therapeutics with desired properties and accelerate antibody discovery campaigns.

The ability to respond to repellents and/or attractants, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and provide cellular mobility are just a few examples of how crucial cilia are to cells and organisms. Over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. Because of the complexity of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required. Here, we present CiliaMiner, a manually curated ciliopathy database that includes ciliopathy lists collected from articles and databases. Analysis reveals that there are 55 distinct disorders likely related to ciliopathy, with over 4000 clinical manifestations. Based on comparative symptom analysis and subcellular localization data, diseases are classified as primary, secondary or atypical ciliopathies. CiliaMiner provides easy access to all of these diseases and disease genes, as well as clinical features and gene-specific clinical features, as well as subcellular localization of each protein.

Currently, there is no up-to-date resource providing harmonized and searchable information on all AD genetic associations found by GWAS, nor linking the reported genetic variants and genes with functional and genomic annotations.<h4>Objective</h4>Create an integrated/harmonized, and literature-derived collection of population-specific AD genetic associations.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed the Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal (ADVP), an extensive collection of associations curated from >200 GWAS publications from Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium and other consortia. Genetic associations were systematically extracted, harmonized, and annotated from both the genome-wide significant and suggestive loci reported in these publications. To ensure consistent representation of AD genetic findings, all the extracted genetic association information was harmonized across specifically designed publication, variant, and association categories.<h4>Results</h4>ADVP V1.0 (February 2021) catalogs 6,990 associations related to disease-risk, expression quantitative traits, endophenotypes, or neuropathology. This extensive harmonization effort led to a catalog containing >900 loci, >1,800 variants, >80 cohorts, and 8 populations. Besides, ADVP provides investigators with a seamless integration of genomic and publicly available functional annotations across multiple databases per harmonized variant and gene records, thus facilitating further understanding and analyses of these genetics findings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ADVP is a valuable resource for investigators to quickly and systematically explore high-confidence AD genetic findings and provides insights into population-specific AD genetic architecture.

A structure-based classification of nearly 150 million unique compounds, obtained from 42 publicly available databases and curated for redundancy removal through 97 hierarchically well-defined atom composition-based portions, has been done. These are further subjected to 56-bit fingerprint-based classification algorithm which led to the formation of 56 structurally well-defined classes. The classes thus obtained were further divided into clusters based on their molecular weight. Thus, the entire set of molecules was put into 56 different classes and 625 clusters. This led to the assignment of a unique ID, named as MPDS-AadharID, for each of these 149,169,443 molecules. MPDS-AadharID is akin to the unique number given to citizens in India (similar to SSN in the US and NINO in the UK). The unique features of MPDS-CL are (a) several search options, such as exact structure search, substructure search, property-based search, fingerprint-based search, using SMILES, InChIKey and key-in; (b) automatic generation of information for the processing for MPDS and other galaxy tools; (c) providing the class and cluster of a molecule which makes it easier and fast to search for similar molecules and (d) information related to the presence of the molecules in multiple databases.

Here, we developed the Chinese Millionome Database (CMDB), a database that contains 9.04 million single nucleotide variants (SNV) with allele frequency information derived from low-coverage (0.06×-0.1×) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 141 431 unrelated healthy Chinese individuals. These individuals were recruited from 31 out of the 34 administrative divisions in China, covering Han and 36 other ethnic minorities. CMDB, housing the WGS data of a multi-ethnic Chinese population featuring wide geographical distribution, has become the most representative and comprehensive Chinese population genome database to date. Researchers can quickly search for variant, gene or genomic regions to obtain the variant information, including mutation basic information, allele frequency, genic annotation and overview of frequencies in global populations. Furthermore, the CMDB also provides information on the association of the variants with a range of phenotypes, including height, BMI, maternal age and twin pregnancy.

37427797,"TarpiD, a database of putative and validated targets of piRNAs.","Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a novel class of 18-36 nts long small non-coding single-stranded RNAs that play crucial roles in a wide array of critical biological activities besides maintaining genome integrity by transposon silencing. piRNAs influence biological processes and pathways by regulating gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Studies have reported that piRNAs silence various endogenous genes post-transcriptionally by binding to respective mRNAs through interaction with the PIWI proteins. Several thousands of piRNAs have been discovered in animals, but their functions remain largely undiscovered owing to a lack of proper guiding principles of piRNA targeting or diversity in targeting patterns amongst piRNAs from the same or different species. Identification of piRNA targets is essential for deciphering their functions. There are a few tools and databases on piRNAs, but there are no systematic and exclusive repositories to obtain information on target genes regulated by piRNAs and other related information. Hence, we developed a user-friendly database named TarpiD (Targets of piRNA Database) that offers comprehensive information on piRNA and its targets, including their expression, methodologies (high-throughput or low-throughput) for target identification/validation, cells/tissue types, diseases, target gene regulation types, target binding regions, and key functions driven by piRNAs through target gene interactions. The contents of TarpiD are curated from the published literature and enable users to search and download the targets of a particular piRNA or the piRNAs that target a specific gene for use in their research. This database harbours 28 682 entries of piRNA-target interactions supported by 15 methodologies reported in hundreds of cell types/tissues from 9 species. TarpiD will be a valuable resource for a better understanding of the functions and gene-regulatory mechanisms mediated by piRNAs.

Here, we report a significant update since the first release of 3DLigandSite in 2010. The overall methodology remains the same, with candidate binding sites in proteins inferred using known binding sites in related protein structures as templates. However, the initial structural modelling step now uses the newly available structures from the AlphaFold database or alternatively Phyre2 when AlphaFold structures are not available. Further, a sequence-based search using HHSearch has been introduced to identify template structures with bound ligands that are used to infer the ligand-binding residues in the query protein. Finally, we introduced a machine learning element as the final prediction step, which improves the accuracy of predictions and provides a confidence score for each residue predicted to be part of a binding site. Validation of 3DLigandSite on a set of 6416 binding sites obtained 92% recall at 75% precision for non-metal binding sites and 52% recall at 75% precision for metal binding sites. 3DLigandSite is available at https://www.wass-michaelislab.org/3dligandsite.

An increasing number of studies showed that cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites falling within other regulatory elements could also regulate target gene activation, mainly by affecting transcription factors (TFs) binding in human cancers. This led to the urgent need for comprehensively and effectively collecting distinct cis-regulatory elements and TF-binding sites (TFBS) to annotate DNA methylation regulation.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a database (CanMethdb, http://meth.liclab.net/CanMethdb/) that focused on the upstream and downstream annotations for CpG-genes in cancers. This included upstream cis-regulatory elements, especially those involving distal regions to genes, and TFBS annotations for the CpGs and downstream functional annotations for the target genes, computed through integrating abundant DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in diverse cancers. Users could inquire CpG-target gene pairs for a cancer type through inputting a genomic region, a CpG, a gene name, or select hypo/hypermethylated CpG sets.

37149650,DeepAR: a novel deep learning-based hybrid framework for the interpretable prediction of androgen receptor antagonists.,"Drug resistance represents a major obstacle to therapeutic innovations and is a prevalent feature in prostate cancer (PCa). Androgen receptors (ARs) are the hallmark therapeutic target for prostate cancer modulation and AR antagonists have achieved great success. However, rapid emergence of resistance contributing to PCa progression is the ultimate burden of their long-term usage. Hence, the discovery and development of AR antagonists with capability to combat the resistance, remains an avenue for further exploration. Therefore, this study proposes a novel deep learning (DL)-based hybrid framework, named DeepAR, to accurately and rapidly identify AR antagonists by using only the SMILES notation. Specifically, DeepAR is capable of extracting and learning the key information embedded in AR antagonists. Firstly, we established a benchmark dataset by collecting active and inactive compounds against AR from the ChEMBL database. Based on this dataset, we developed and optimized a collection of baseline models by using a comprehensive set of well-known molecular descriptors and machine learning algorithms. Then, these baseline models were utilized for creating probabilistic features. Finally, these probabilistic features were combined and used for the construction of a meta-model based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Experimental results indicated that DeepAR is a more accurate and stable approach for identifying AR antagonists in terms of the independent test dataset, by achieving an accuracy of 0.911 and MCC of 0.823. In addition, our proposed framework is able to provide feature importance information by leveraging a popular computational approach, named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). In the meanwhile, the characterization and analysis of potential AR antagonist candidates were achieved through the SHAP waterfall plot and molecular docking. The analysis inferred that N-heterocyclic moieties, halogenated substituents, and a cyano functional group were significant determinants of potential AR antagonists. Lastly, we implemented an online web server by using DeepAR (at http://pmlabstack.pythonanywhere.com/DeepAR ).

36969452,SCARdock: A Web Server and Manually Curated Resource for Discovering Covalent Ligands.,"<h4>Background</h4>Covalent drugs have been intentionally discarded historically due to the concern of off-target side effects, but the past decade has seen a fast resurgence of the discovery of covalent drugs. Compared to noncovalent ligands, covalent ligands might have better biochemical efficiency, lower patient burden, less dosing frequency, less drug resistance, and improved target specificity.<h4>Results</h4>Previously, we proposed the steric-clashes alleviating receptor (SCAR) strategy for screening and repurposing covalent inhibitors. To help the discovery of covalent ligands targeting protein targets, we have developed a web server dedicated to providing the SCARdock protocol to general users. Along with this server, we presented three high-quality data sets for the discovery of covalent ligands: a manually curated data set containing 954 high-quality complex structures of covalent ligands and proteins, a manually curated data set of 68 experimentally confirmed covalent warheads targeting 11 different residues, and a prefiltered, classified, and ready-to-use data set of 690,018 entries of purchasable virtual compounds containing these experimentally verified warheads.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SCARdock server and the accompanied data sets would be of great value to the discovery of covalent ligands and are available freely at http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/ or https://scardock.com.",True,False,4.0,,scardock,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,SCARdock,True,8.0,True,True,http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/ | https://scardock.com,http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/,True,...y of covalent ligands and are available freely at http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/ or https://scardock.com.,1

37428248,Deep learning model for predicting the survival of patients with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma based on the SEER database and a multicentre external validation cohort.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Due to the rarity of primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL), the prognostic factors and optimal management of PGIL have not been clearly defined. We aimed to establish prognostic models using a deep learning algorithm for survival prediction.<h4>Methods</h4>We collected 11,168 PGIL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to form the training and test cohorts. At the same time, we collected 82 PGIL patients from three medical centres to form the external validation cohort. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, random survival forest (RSF) model, and neural multitask logistic regression (DeepSurv) model to predict PGIL patients' overall survival (OS).<h4>Results</h4>The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of PGIL patients in the SEER database were 77.1%, 69.4%, 63.7%, and 50.3%, respectively. The RSF model based on all variables showed that the top three most important variables for predicting OS were age, histological type, and chemotherapy. The independent risk factors for PGIL patient prognosis included sex, age, race, primary site, Ann Arbor stage, histological type, symptom, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, according to the Lasso regression analysis. Using these factors, we built the CoxPH and DeepSurv models. The DeepSurv model's C-index values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.742 in the test cohort, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort, which demonstrated that the DeepSurv model performed better compared to the RSF model (0.728) and the CoxPH model (0.724). The DeepSurv model accurately predicted 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS. Both calibration curves and decision curve analysis curves demonstrated the superior performance of the DeepSurv model.

37657924,TICBase: Integrated Resource for Data on Drug and Environmental Chemical Interactions with Mammalian Drug Transporters.,"Environmental health science seeks to predict how environmental toxins, chemical toxicants, and prescription drugs accumulate and interact within the body. Xenobiotic transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) superfamilies are major determinants of the uptake and disposition of xenobiotics across the kingdoms of life. The goal of this study was to integrate drug and environmental chemical interactions of mammalian ABC and SLC proteins in a centralized, integrative database. We built upon an existing publicly accessible platform-the ""TransPortal""-which was updated with novel data and searchable features on transporter-interfering chemicals from manually curated literature data. The integrated resource TransPortal-TICBase (https://transportal.compbio.ucsf.edu) now contains information on 46 different mammalian xenobiotic transporters of the ABC- and SLC-type superfamilies, including 13 newly added rodent and 2 additional human drug transporters, 126 clinical drug-drug interactions, and a more than quadrupled expansion of the initial in vitro chemical interaction data from 1,402 to 6,296 total interactions. Based on our updated database, environmental interference with major human and rodent drug transporters occurs across the ABC- and SLC-type superfamilies, with kinetics indicating that some chemicals, such as the ionic liquid 1-hexylpyridinium chloride and the antiseptic chlorhexidine, can act as strong inhibitors with potencies similar or even higher than pharmacological model inhibitors. The new integrated web portal serves as a central repository of current and emerging data for interactions of prescription drugs and environmental chemicals with human drug transporters. This archive has important implications for predicting adverse drug-drug and drug-environmental chemical interactions and can serve as a reference website for the broader scientific community of clinicians and researchers.",True,False,4.0,,ticbase,,16.0,ok,,transportal- | transportal-ticbase,,spacy,0.0,TICBase,True,3.0,True,True,https://transportal.compbio.ucsf.edu,https://transportal.compbio.ucsf.edu,True,...ata.

39591252,ScorpDb: A Novel Open-Access Database for Integrative Scorpion Toxinology.,"Scorpion stings are a significant public health concern globally, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Scorpion venoms contain a diverse array of bioactive peptides, and different scorpion species around the world typically exhibit varying venom profiles, resulting in a wide range of envenomation symptoms. Despite their harmful effects, scorpion venom peptides hold immense potential for drug development due to their unique characteristics. Therefore, the establishment of a comprehensive database that catalogs scorpions along with their known venom peptides and proteins is imperative in furthering research efforts in this research area. We hereby present ScorpDb, a novel database that offers convenient access to data related to different scorpion species, the peptides and proteins found in their venoms, and the symptoms they can cause. To this end, the ScorpDb database has been primarily advanced to accommodate data on the Iranian scorpion fauna. From there, we propose future community efforts to include a larger diversity of scorpions and scorpion venom components.

35609986,AlignMe: an update of the web server for alignment of membrane protein sequences.,"The AlignMe web server is dedicated to accurately aligning sequences of membrane proteins, a particularly challenging task due to the strong evolutionary divergence and the low compositional complexity of hydrophobic membrane-spanning proteins. AlignMe can create pairwise alignments of either two primary amino acid sequences or two hydropathy profiles. The web server for AlignMe has been continuously available for >10 years, supporting 1000s of users per year. Recent improvements include anchoring, multiple submissions, and structure visualization. Anchoring is the ability to constrain a position in an alignment, which allows expert information about related residues in proteins to be incorporated into an alignment without manual modification. The original web interface to the server limited the user to one alignment per submission, hindering larger scale studies. Now, batches of alignments can be initiated with a single submission. Finally, to provide structural context for the relationship between proteins, sequence similarity can now be mapped onto one or more structures (or structural models) of the proteins being aligned, by links to MutationExplorer, a web-based visualization tool. Together with a refreshed user interface, these features further enhance an important resource in the membrane protein community.

A delineation of subcellular localization of proteins on cytosolic membrane-bound organelles in human liver cancer cell lines (hLCCLs) has yet to be performed. To obtain its proteome-wide view, we isolated and enriched six cytosolic membrane-bound organelles in one of the hLCCLs (SK_HEP1) and quantified their proteins using mass spectrometry. The vigorous selection of marker proteins and a machine-learning-based algorithm were implemented to localize proteins at cluster and neighborhood levels. We validated the performance of the proposed method by comparing the predicted subcellular protein localization with publicly available resources. The profiles enabled investigating the correlation of protein domains with their subcellular localization and colocalization of protein complex members. A subcellular proteome database for SK_HEP1, including (i) the subcellular protein localization and (ii) the subcellular locations of protein complex members and their interactions, was constructed.

To boost the research on AAA, efforts should be taken to organize and link the information about AAA-related genes and their functions. Currently, most researchers screen through genetic databases manually, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, we developed ""AAAKB"" a manually curated knowledgebase containing genes, SNPs and pathways associated with AAA. In order to facilitate researchers to further explore the mechanism network of AAA, AAAKB provides predicted genes that are potentially associated with AAA. The prediction is based on the protein interaction information of genes collected in the database, and the random forest algorithm (RF) is used to build the prediction model. Some of these predicted genes are differentially expressed in patients with AAA, and some have been reported to play a role in other cardiovascular diseases, illustrating the utility of the knowledgebase in predicting novel genes.

By curating thousands of published literature, 2157 aging factor entries (1345 aging gene entries, 804 external factor entries and eight aging-related pathway entries) and related regulatory information were manually curated. The regulatory relationships were classified into four types according to their functions: (i) upregulation, which indicates that aging factors upregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (ii) downregulation, which indicates that aging factors downregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (iii) activation, which indicates that aging factors influence the activity of target genes during aging and (iv) inhibition, which indicates that aging factors inhibit the activation of target molecule activity, leading to declined or lost target activity. AgingReG involves 651 upregulating pairs, 632 downregulating pairs, 330 activation-regulating pairs and 34 inhibition-regulating pairs, covering 195 disease types and more than 800 kinds of cells and tissues from 1784 published literature studies.

37871298,HGMMX: Host Gut Microbiota Metabolism Xenobiotics Database.,"The metagenome of bacteria colonizing the human intestine is a set of genes that is almost 150 times greater than the set of host genes. Some of these genes encode enzymes whose functioning significantly expands the number of potential pathways for xenobiotic metabolism. The resulting metabolites can exhibit activity different from that of the parent compound. This can decrease the efficacy of pharmacotherapy as well as induce undesirable and potentially life-threatening side effects. Thus, analysis of the biotransformation of small drug-like compounds mediated by the gut microbiota is an important step in the development of new pharmaceutical agents and repurposing of the approved drugs. <i>In vitro</i> research, the interaction of drug-like compounds with the gut microbiota is a multistep and time-consuming process. Systematic testing of large sets of chemical structures is associated with a number of challenges, including the lack of standardized techniques and significant financial costs to identify the structure of the final metabolites. Estimation of the compounds' ability to be biotransformed by the gut microbiota and prediction of the structures of their metabolites are possible <i>in silico</i>. However, the development of computational approaches is limited by the lack of information about chemical structures metabolized by microbiota enzymes. The aim of this study is to create a database containing information on the metabolism of drug-like compounds by the gut microbiota. We created the data set containing information about 368 structures metabolized and 310 structures not metabolized by the human gut microbiota.

Enzyme biotransformation is a promising option for detoxifying mycotoxins and for elucidating their intracellular metabolism. However, few mycotoxin-biotransformation enzymes have been identified thus far. Here, we developed an enzyme promiscuity prediction for mycotoxin biotransformation (EPP-MB) model by fine-tuning a pretrained model using a cold protein data-splitting approach. The EPP-MB model leverages deep learning to predict enzymes capable of mycotoxin biotransformation, achieving a validation accuracy of 79% against a data set of experimentally confirmed mycotoxin-biotransforming enzymes. We applied the model to predict potential biotransformation enzymes for over 4000 mycotoxins and compiled these into the DeepMBEnzy database, which archives the predicted enzymes and related information for each mycotoxin, providing researchers with a user-friendly, publicly accessible interface at https://synbiodesign.com/DeepMBEnzy/.

39231258,CuPCA: a web server for pan-cancer association analysis of large-scale cuproptosis-related genes.,"Copper-induced cell death is a novel mechanism of cell death, which is defined as cuproptosis. The increasing level of copper can produce toxicity in cells and may cause the occurrence of cell death. Several previous studies have proved that cuproptosis has a tight association with various cancers. Thus, the discovery of relationships between cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) and human cancers is of great importance. Pan-cancer analysis can efficiently help researchers find out the relationship between multiple cancers and target genes precisely and make various prognostic analyses on cancers and cancer patients. Pan-cancer web servers can provide researchers with direct results of pan-cancer prognostic analyses, which can greatly improve the efficiency of their work. However, to date, no web server provides pan-cancer analysis about CRGs. Therefore, we introduce the cuproptosis pan-cancer analysis database (CuPCA), the first database for various analysis results of CRGs through 33 cancer types. CuPCA is a user-friendly resource for cancer researchers to gain various prognostic analyses between cuproptosis and cancers. It provides single CRG pan-cancer analysis, multi-CRGs pan-cancer analysis, multi-CRlncRNA pan-cancer analysis, and mRNA-circRNA-lncRNA conjoint analysis. These analysis results can not only indicate the relationship between cancers and cuproptosis at both gene level and protein level, but also predict the conditions of different cancer patients, which include their clinical condition, survival condition, and their immunological condition.

However, the computational design of stable proteins often results in single-point mutations with a limited effect on protein stability. However, the construction of stable multiple-point mutants can prove difficult due to the possibility of antagonistic effects between individual mutations. FireProt protocol enables the automated computational design of highly stable multiple-point mutants. FireProt 2.0 builds on top of the previously published FireProt web, retaining the original functionality and expanding it with several new stabilization strategies.

A variety of powerful computational methods have been developed to predict such valuable interactions. However, all these methods rely heavily on the 'digitalization' (also known as 'encoding') of RNA-associated interacting pairs into a computer-recognizable descriptor. In other words, it is urgently needed to have a powerful tool that can not only represent each interacting partner but also integrate both partners into a computer-recognizable interaction. Herein, RNAincoder (deep learning-based encoder for RNA-associated interactions) was therefore proposed to (a) provide a comprehensive collection of RNA encoding features, (b) realize the representation of any RNA-associated interaction based on a well-established deep learning-based embedding strategy and (c) enable large-scale scanning of all possible feature combinations to identify the one of optimal performance in RNA-associated interaction prediction.

39395187,StopKB: a comprehensive knowledgebase for nonsense suppression therapies.,"Nonsense variations, characterized by premature termination codons, play a major role in human genetic diseases as well as in cancer susceptibility. Despite their high prevalence, effective therapeutic strategies targeting premature termination codons remain a challenge. To understand and explore the intricate mechanisms involved, we developed StopKB, a comprehensive knowledgebase aggregating data from multiple sources on nonsense variations, associated genes, diseases, and phenotypes. StopKB identifies 637 317 unique nonsense variations, distributed across 18 022 human genes and linked to 3206 diseases and 7765 phenotypes. Notably, ∼32% of these variations are classified as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay-insensitive, potentially representing suitable targets for nonsense suppression therapies. We also provide an interactive web interface to facilitate efficient and intuitive data exploration, enabling researchers and clinicians to navigate the complex landscape of nonsense variations. StopKB represents a valuable resource for advancing research in precision medicine and more specifically, the development of targeted therapeutic interventions for genetic diseases associated with nonsense variations.

Database 'AbAMPdb' is the manually curated collection of 300 entries containing the 250 experimental AMP sequences and 50 corresponding synthetic or mutated AMP sequences. The mutated sequences were modified with reported amino acid substitutions intended for decreasing the toxicity and increasing the antimicrobial potency. AbAMPdb also provides 3D models of all 300 AMPs, comprising 250 natural and 50 synthetic or mutated AMPs. Moreover, the database offers docked complexes comprising 5000 AMPs and their corresponding A. baumannii target proteins. These complexes, accessible in Protein Data Bank format, enable the 2D visualization of the interacting amino acid residues. We are confident that this comprehensive resource furnishes vital information concerning AMPs, encompassing their docking interactions with virulence factors and antibiotic resistance proteins of A. baumannii.

37986218,iNClusive: a database collecting useful information on non-canonical amino acids and their incorporation into proteins for easier genetic code expansion implementation.,"The incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins is a powerful technique used in various research fields. Genetic code expansion (GCE) is the most common way to achieve this: a specific codon is selected to be decoded by a dedicated tRNA orthogonal to the endogenous ones. In the past 30 years, great progress has been made to obtain novel tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) accepting a variety of ncAAs with distinct physicochemical properties, to develop robust in vitro assays or approaches for codon reassignment. This sparked the use of the technique, leading to the accumulation of publications, from which gathering all relevant information can appear daunting. Here we present iNClusive (https://non-canonical-aas.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/), a manually curated, extensive repository using standardized nomenclature that provides organized information on ncAAs successfully incorporated into target proteins as verified by mass spectrometry.

NMR spectroscopy has long been viewed as the 'gold standard' for the structure determination of novel natural products and novel metabolites. NMR is also widely used in natural product dereplication and the characterization of biofluid mixtures (metabolomics). All of these NMR applications require large collections of high quality, well-annotated, referential NMR spectra of pure compounds. Unfortunately, referential NMR spectral collections for natural products are quite limited. It is because of the critical need for dedicated, open access natural product NMR resources that the NP-MRD was funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). Since its launch in 2020, the NP-MRD has grown quickly to become the world's largest repository for NMR data on natural products and other biological substances. It currently contains both structural and NMR data for nearly 41,000 natural product compounds from >7400 different living species.

35381376,ARBRE: Computational resource to predict pathways towards industrially important aromatic compounds.,"Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering rely on computational search tools for predictions of novel biosynthetic pathways to industrially important compounds, many of which are derived from aromatic amino acids. Pathway search tools vary in their scope of covered reactions and compounds, as well as in metrics for ranking and evaluation. In this work, we present a new computational resource called ARBRE: Aromatic compounds RetroBiosynthesis Repository and Explorer. It consists of a comprehensive biochemical reaction network centered around aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and a computational toolbox for navigating this network. ARBRE encompasses over 33'000 known and 390'000 novel reactions predicted with generalized enzymatic reactions rules and over 74'000 compounds, of which 19'000 are known to biochemical databases and 55'000 only to PubChem. Over 1'000 molecules that were solely part of the PubChem database before and were previously impossible to integrate into a biochemical network are included into the ARBRE reaction network by assigning enzymatic reactions. ARBRE can be applied for pathway search, enzyme annotation, pathway ranking, visualization, and network expansion around known biochemical pathways and products of lignin degradation to predict valuable compound derivations. In line with the standards of open science, we have made the toolbox freely available to the scientific community on git (https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/ARBRE) and we provide the web-version at http://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/arbre/.

However, accurately predicting the immunogenicity of neoantigens remains a significant challenge. This is mainly due to two core factors: the scarcity of high-quality neoantigen datasets and the limited prediction accuracy of existing immunogenicity prediction tools. This study addressed these issues through several key steps. First, it collected and organized immunogenic neoantigen peptide data from publicly available literature and neoantigen databases. Second, it analyzed the data to identify key features influencing neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. Finally, it integrated existing prediction tools to create TumorAgDB1.0, a comprehensive tumor neoantigen database. TumorAgDB1.0 offers a user-friendly platform.

Here, we present EndoQuad (https://EndoQuad.chenzxlab.cn/) to address these pressing issues by integrating high-throughput experimental data. First, based on high-quality genome-wide eG4s mapping datasets (human: 1181; mouse: 24; chicken: 2) generated by G4 ChIP-seq/CUT&Tag, we generate a reference set of genome-wide eG4s. Our multi-omics analyses show that most eG4s are identified in one or a few cell types. The eG4s with higher occurrences across samples are more structurally stable, evolutionarily conserved, enriched in promoter regions, mark highly expressed genes and associate with complex regulatory programs, demonstrating higher confidence level for further experiments. Finally, we integrate millions of functional genomic variants and prioritize eG4s with regulatory functions in disease and cancer contexts. These efforts have culminated in the comprehensive and interactive database of experimentally validated DNA eG4s.

Here, using large-scale transcriptome data, we constructed co-expression networks for diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat species, and built a platform for comparing co-expression networks of allohexaploid wheat and its progenitors, named WheatCENet. WheatCENet is a platform for searching and comparing specific functional co-expression networks, as well as identifying the related functions of the genes clustered therein. Functional annotations like pathways, gene families, protein-protein interactions, microRNAs (miRNAs), and several lines of epigenome data are integrated into this platform, and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), motif identification, and other useful tools are also included. Using WheatCENet, we found that the network of WHEAT ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (WAPO1) has more co-expressed genes related to spike development in hexaploid wheat than its progenitors. We also found a novel motif of CCWWWWWWGG (CArG) specifically in the promoter region of WAPO-A1, suggesting that neofunctionalization of the WAPO-A1 gene affects spikelet development in hexaploid wheat. WheatCENet is useful for investigating co-expression networks and conducting other analyses, and thus facilitates comparative and functional genomic studies in wheat.

We identified extensive available TF-target genes by collecting and processing TF-associated ChIP-seq datasets, perturbation RNA-seq datasets and motifs. We also obtained experimentally confirmed relationships between TF and target genes from available resources. Overall, the target genes of TFs were obtained through integrating the relevant data of various TFs as well as fourteen identification strategies.

Validated corpora of these vocalizations have facilitated emotion-related research and found wide-ranging applications. However, existing corpora have lacked representation from diverse cultural backgrounds, which may limit the generalizability of the resulting theories. The present paper introduces the Chinese Nonverbal Emotional Vocalization (CNEV) corpus, the first nonverbal emotional vocalization corpus recorded and validated entirely by Mandarin speakers from China. The CNEV corpus contains 2415 vocalizations across five emotion categories: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and neutrality. It also includes a database containing subjective evaluation data on emotion category, valence, arousal, and speaker gender, as well as the acoustic features of the vocalizations. Key conclusions drawn from statistical analyses of perceptual evaluations and acoustic analysis include the following: (1) the CNEV corpus exhibits adequate reliability and high validity; (2) perceptual evaluations reveal a tendency for individuals to associate anger with male voices and fear with female voices; (3) acoustic analysis indicates that males are more effective at expressing anger, while females excel in expressing fear; and (4) the observed perceptual patterns align with the acoustic analysis results, suggesting that the perceptual differences may stem not only from the subjective factors of perceivers but also from objective expressive differences in the vocalizations themselves.

We created an Eyewitness Lineup Identity (ELI) database, which includes crime videos and mugshot images of 231 identities. We arranged the mugshots into 6-, 9-, and 12-member lineups, and then we tested the stimuli in an eyewitness experiment. Participants (N = 1584) completed six trials of viewing a crime video and completing a lineup identification task. In lineups that included the culprit, the average probability of correction identification was 59.0%, 95% CI [55.9, 62.0]. In lineups that did not include the culprit, the average probability of false alarm was 29.9% [27.8, 32.0].

Interest in this structure has grown over the past few years due to both its implication in diverse biological mechanisms and its potential use as a therapeutic target, to name two examples. G4s in humans have been widely studied; however, the level of their study in other species remains relatively minimal. That said, progress in this field has resulted in the prediction of G4s structures in various species, ranging from bacteria to eukaryotes. These predictions were analysed in a previous study which revealed that G4s are present in all living kingdoms. To date, eleven different databases have grouped the various G4s depending on either their structures, on the proteins that might bind them, or on their location in the various genomes. However, none of these databases contains information on their location in the transcriptome of many of the implicated species. The GAIA database was designed so as to make this data available online in a user-friendly manner.

A better understanding of the role of miRNAs in diseases is essential for human health. Here, we have devised a method for comprehensively mapping the associations between miRNAs and diseases by merging on a common key between two curated omics databases. The resulting bidirectional resource, miR2Trait, is more detailed than earlier catalogs, uncovers new relationships, and includes analytical utilities to interrogate and extract knowledge from these datasets. miR2Trait provides resources to compute the disease enrichment of a user-given set of miRNAs and analyze the miRNA profile of a specified diseasome. Reproducible examples demonstrating use-cases for each of these resource components are illustrated. Furthermore we used these tools to construct pairwise miRNA-miRNA and disease-disease enrichment networks, and identified 23 central miRNAs that could underlie major regulatory functions in the human genome. miR2Trait is available as an open-source command-line interface in Python3 (URL: https://github.com/miR2Trait) with a companion wiki documenting the scripts and data resources developed, under MIT license for commercial and non-commercial use.

36495921,R-SIM: A Database of Binding Affinities for RNA-small Molecule Interactions.,"Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are involved in a multitude of crucial cellular functions by acting as a central conduit for information transfer. Due to their essential and versatile functional roles in the cell, RNAs have also been implicated in multiple disease conditions of therapeutic relevance including cancers, bacterial and viral infections and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, several approaches have emerged to tap into the potentially unexplored regions of the druggable genome, which refers to the genes and gene products that are focused during drug development. For example, considering RNAs as viable alternative therapeutic targets for drug development can potentially expand the range of therapeutic targets. Consequently, the availability of adequate binding affinity measurements for RNA-small molecule interactions is essential to understand target selectivity and design more potent RNA-targeting drug-like molecules. To facilitate this growing need, we have curated a database of experimentally validated RNA-small molecule interactions, called RNA-Small molecule Interaction Miner (R-SIM). Each entry in R-SIM provides comprehensive information on sequence, structure and classification of the RNA target, various physicochemical properties of the small molecule, binding affinity value and corresponding experimental conditions, three-dimensional structure (experimental or modelled) of the RNA-small molecule complex, and the literature source for the data.

35971647,The Brain Protein Atlas: A conglomerate of proteomics datasets of human neural tissue.,"The human brain represents one of the most complex biological structures with significant spatiotemporal molecular plasticity occurring through early development, learning, aging, and disease. While much progress has been made in mapping its transcriptional architecture, more downstream phenotypic readouts are relatively scarce due to limitations with tissue heterogeneity and accessibility, as well as an inability to amplify protein species prior to global -OMICS analysis. To address some of these barriers, our group has recently focused on using mass-spectrometry workflows compatible with small amounts of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. This has enabled exploration into spatiotemporal proteomic signatures of the brain and disease across otherwise inaccessible neurodevelopmental timepoints and anatomical niches. Given the similar theme and approaches, we introduce an integrated online portal, ""The Brain Protein Atlas (BPA)"" (www.brainproteinatlas.org), representing a public resource that allows users to access and explore these amalgamated datasets. Specifically, this portal contains a growing set of peer-reviewed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic datasets, including spatiotemporal profiles of human cerebral development, diffuse gliomas, clinically aggressive meningiomas, and a detailed anatomic atlas of glioblastoma. One barrier to entry in mass spectrometry-based proteomics data analysis is the steep learning curve required to extract biologically relevant data. BPA, therefore, includes several built-in analytical tools to generate relevant plots (e.g., volcano plots, heatmaps, boxplots, and scatter plots) and evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of proteins of interest. Future iterations aim to expand available datasets, including those generated by the community at large, and analytical tools for exploration.

Although many docking methods have been designed, most of them require a user-defined binding site and are difficult to achieve a high-quality protein-ATP docking result. It is critical to develop a protein-ATP-specific blind docking method without user-defined binding sites.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present ATPdock, a template-based method for docking ATP into protein. For each query protein, if no pocket site is given, ATPdock first identifies its most potential pocket using ATPbind, an ATP-binding site predictor; then, the template pocket, which is most similar to the given or identified pocket, is searched from the database of pocket-ligand structures using APoc, a pocket structural alignment tool; thirdly, the rough docking pose of ATP (rdATP) is generated using LS-align, a ligand structural alignment tool, to align the initial ATP pose to the template ligand corresponding to template pocket; finally, the Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is used to fine-tune the rdATP under the guidance of AutoDock Vina energy function.

Loss-of-function experiments are difficult to conduct on circular and linear chromosomes, as they usually overlap. Hence, it is challenging to interpret the molecular functions of eccDNAs. Here, we present CircleBase (http://circlebase.maolab.org), an integrated resource and analysis platform used to curate and interpret eccDNAs in multiple cell types. CircleBase identifies putative functional eccDNAs by incorporating sequencing datasets, computational predictions, and manual annotations. It classifies them into six sections including targeting genes, epigenetic regulations, regulatory elements, chromatin accessibility, chromatin interactions, and genetic variants. The eccDNA targeting and regulatory networks are displayed by informative visualization tools and then prioritized. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that the top-ranked cancer cell eccDNAs were enriched in oncogenic pathways such as the Ras and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. In contrast, eccDNAs from healthy individuals were not significantly enriched.

Characterizing these modifications, especially PTM sites, is essential for unraveling complex biological systems. However, traditional experimental approaches, such as mass spectrometry, are time-consuming and expensive. Machine learning and deep learning techniques offer promising alternatives for predicting PTM sites. In this chapter, we introduce our LMPTMSite (language model-based post-translational modification site predictor) platform, which emphasizes two transformer-based protein language model (pLM) approaches: pLMSNOSite and LMSuccSite, for the prediction of S-nitrosylation sites and succinylation sites in proteins, respectively. We highlight the various methods of using pLM-based sequence encoding, explain the underlying deep learning architectures, and discuss the superior efficacy of these tools compared to other state-of-the-art tools.

Genetic variation, particularly SNPs in miRNA sequences and the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of their target genes, can disrupt miRNA-mRNA interactions, leading to altered gene expression. Despite several existing databases providing insights into various aspects of miRNAs and their target genes in association with the development of the disease. Still, there remains a critical gap in a unified, BC-specific repository that integrates SNPs in miRNAs, their target genes, and associated molecular mechanisms. To address this, we developed BreVamiR3' (Breast cancer-associated genetic Variations in miRNA and 3'UTR of their target genes), a novel, freely accessible database (https://brevamir3.web.app/index.html). BreVamiR3' features comprehensive and curated data on 500 miRNAs and 828 target genes associated with BC, including experimentally validated SNPs, chromosomal loci, expression profiles, BC subtypes, signaling pathways, and classifications of genes i.e. oncogene, tumor suppressor, or both.

Aberrant DNA methylation plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation during cancer transformation, highlighting the need to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) as potential diagnostic and therapeutic markers. However, an integrated resource to explore and validate methylation alterations across colorectal cancer stages has been lacking. We aimed to develop a platform that integrates existing methylation data, systematically identifies DMRs and provides a tool for further investigation.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>We created a database combining Illumina HumanMethylation450K and EPIC data from normal colon, adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues, comprising 2346 samples from 19 datasets. Methylation levels were analysed in six gene regions, and comparisons between tissue types were made using Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and ROC tests.<h4>Key results</h4>Both adenoma and adenocarcinoma samples exhibited a general decrease in methylation compared to healthy tissue. Differential methylation in genes such as ITGA4, NPY, IGFL1 and LRRC4 was validated. The strongest DMRs were observed in the C1orf70 gene's 5'UTR and TSS200 regions, with AUC values of 0.98 in both of the HM450K and EPIC datasets.

Six years after introducing EzBioCloud, an integrated platform representing the taxonomic hierarchy of Bacteria and Archaea through quality-controlled 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences, we present an updated version, that further refines and expands its capabilities. The current update recognizes the growing need for accurate taxonomic information as defining a species increasingly relies on genome sequence comparisons. We also incorporated an advanced strategy for addressing underrepresented or less studied lineages, bolstering the comprehensiveness and accuracy of our database. Our rigorous quality control protocols remain, where whole-genome assemblies from the NCBI Assembly Database undergo stringent screening to remove low-quality sequence data. These are then passed through our enhanced identification bioinformatics pipeline which initiates a 16S rRNA gene similarity search and then calculates the average nucleotide identity (ANI). For genome sequences lacking a 16S rRNA sequence and without a closely related genomic representative for ANI calculation, we apply a different ANI approach using bacterial core genes for improved taxonomic placement (core gene ANI, cgANI). Because of the increase in genome sequences available in NCBI and our newly introduced cgANI method, EzBioCloud now encompasses a total of 109 835 species, of which 21 964 have validly published names. 47 896 are candidate species identified either through 16S rRNA sequence similarity (phylotypes) or through whole genome ANI (genomospecies), and the remaining 39 975 were positioned in the taxonomic tree by cgANI (species clusters).

Here, we present a versatile data portal, enhancer activity quantitative trait loci database (eaQTLdb; http://www.bioailab.com:3838/eaQTLdb), for exploring the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity and prioritizing candidate variants across different cancer types. By leveraging the accumulated multiomics data, we systematically identified genetic variants which influence enhancer activity in different cancer types, termed as eaQTLs. We have linked the eaQTLs to hallmarks of cancer and patients' overall survival to illustrate their potential biological roles in cancer development and progression. Notably, eaQTLs associated with the infiltration abundance of 24 different immune cell types were identified and incorporated into eaQTLdb. In addition, we applied colocalization analyses to examine 59 complex diseases and traits to identify eaQTLs colocalized with diseases/traits GWAS signals. Overall, eaQTLdb, incorporating a rich resource for exploration of eaQTLs in different cancer types, will not only benefit users in prioritizing candidate genetic variants and enhancers, but also help researchers decipher the roles of eaQTLs in the dysregulated pathways of cancer and tumor immune microenvironment, opening new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues in precise medicine.",True,False,3.5,,eaqtldb,,16.0,ok,,enhancer activity quantitative trait loci database,,spacy,0.0,eaQTLdb,True,1.0,True,True,http://www.bioailab.com:3838/eaQTLdb | http://www.bioailab.com,http://www.bioailab.com:3838/eaQTLdb,True,"...tivity quantitative trait loci database (eaQTLdb; http://www.bioailab.com:3838/eaQTLdb), for exploring the effects of genetic variants o...",1

36922546,CAFrgDB: a database for cancer-associated fibroblasts related genes and their functions in cancer.,"As one of the most essential components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) interact extensively with cancer cells and other stromal cells to remodel TME and participate in the pathogenesis of cancer, which earmarked themselves as new promising targets for cancer therapy. Numerous studies have highlighted the heterogeneity and versatility of CAFs in most cancer types. Thus, the identification and appropriate use of CAF-related genes (CAFGenes) in the context of specific cancer types will provide critical insights into disease mechanisms and CAF-related therapeutic targets. In this study, we collected and curated 5421 CAFGenes identified from small- or large-scale experiments, encompassing 4982 responsors that directly or indirectly participate in cancer malignant behaviors managed by CAFs, 1069 secretions that are secreted by CAFs and 281 regulators that contribute in modulating CAFs in human and mouse, which covered 24 cancer types. For these human CAFGenes, we performed gene expression and prognostic marker-based analyses across 24 cancer types using TCGA data. Furthermore, we provided annotations for CAF-associated proteins by integrating the knowledge of protein-protein interaction(s), drug-target relations and basic annotations, from 9 public databases.

39478454,BASE: a web service for providing compound-protein binding affinity prediction datasets with reduced similarity bias.,"<h4>Background</h4>Deep learning-based drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction methods have shown impressive performance, despite a high number of training parameters relative to the available data. Previous studies have highlighted the presence of dataset bias by suggesting that models trained solely on protein or ligand structures may perform similarly to those trained on complex structures. However, these studies did not propose solutions and focused solely on analyzing complex structure-based models. Even when ligands are excluded, protein-only models trained on complex structures still incorporate some ligand information at the binding sites. Therefore, it is unclear whether binding affinity can be accurately predicted using only compound or protein features due to potential dataset bias. In this study, we expanded our analysis to comprehensive databases and investigated dataset bias through compound and protein feature-based methods using multilayer perceptron models. We assessed the impact of this bias on current prediction models and proposed the binding affinity similarity explorer (BASE) web service, which provides bias-reduced datasets.<h4>Results</h4>By analyzing eight binding affinity databases using multilayer perceptron models, we confirmed a bias where the compound-protein binding affinity can be accurately predicted using compound features alone. This bias arises because most compounds show consistent binding affinities due to high sequence or functional similarity among their target proteins. Our Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection analysis based on compound fingerprints further revealed that low and high variation compounds do not exhibit significant structural differences. This suggests that the primary factor driving the consistent binding affinities is protein similarity rather than compound structure. We addressed this bias by creating datasets with progressively reduced protein similarity between the training and test sets, observing significant changes in model performance. We developed the BASE web service to allow researchers to download and utilize these datasets. Feature importance analysis revealed that previous models heavily relied on protein features. However, using bias-reduced datasets increased the importance of compound and interaction features, enabling a more balanced extraction of key features.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We propose the BASE web service, providing both the affinity prediction results of existing models and bias-reduced datasets. These resources contribute to the development of generalized and robust predictive models, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of DTA predictions in the drug discovery process.

39707929,MiCK: a database of gut microbial genes linked with chemoresistance in cancer patients.,"Cancer remains a global health challenge, with significant morbidity and mortality rates. In 2020, cancer caused nearly 10 million deaths, making it the second leading cause of death worldwide. The emergence of chemoresistance has become a major hurdle in successfully treating cancer patients. Recently, human gut microbes have been recognized for their role in modulating drug efficacy through their metabolites, ultimately leading to chemoresistance. The currently available databases are limited to knowledge regarding the interactions between gut microbiome and drugs. However, a database containing the human gut microbial gene sequences, and their effect on the efficacy of chemotherapy for cancer patients has not yet been developed. To address this challenge, we present the Microbial Chemoresistance Knowledgebase (MiCK), a comprehensive database that catalogs microbial gene sequences associated with chemoresistance. MiCK contains 1.6 million sequences of 29 gene types linked to chemoresistance and drug metabolism, curated manually from recent literature and sequence databases. The database can support downstream analysis as it provides a user-friendly web interface for sequence search and download functionalities.

39724337,HemaCisDB: An Interactive Database for Analyzing Cis-regulatory Elements Across Hematopoietic Malignancies.,"Non-coding cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as transcriptional enhancers, are key regulators of gene expression programs. Accessible chromatin and H3K27ac are well-recognized markers for CREs associated with their biological function. Deregulation of CREs is commonly found in hematopoietic malignancies, yet the extent to which CRE dysfunction contributes to pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Here, we developed HemaCisDB, an interactive, comprehensive, and centralized online resource for CRE characterization across hematopoietic malignancies, serving as a useful resource for investigating the pathological roles of CREs in blood disorders. Currently, we collected 922 assay of transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), 190 DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing (DNase-seq), and 531 H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets from patient samples and cell lines across different myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. HemaCisDB provides comprehensive quality control metrics to assess ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data quality. The analytic modules in HemaCisDB include transcription factor (TF) footprinting inference, super-enhancer identification, and core transcriptional regulatory circuitry analysis. Moreover, HemaCisDB also enables the study of TF binding dynamics by comparing TF footprints across different disease types or conditions via web-based interactive analysis.

37856620,GIFTdb: a useful gene database for plant fruit traits improving.,"Fruit traits are critical determinants of plant fitness, resource diversity, productive and quality. Gene regulatory networks in plants play an essential role in determining fruit traits, such as fruit size, yield, firmness, aroma and other important features. Many research studies have focused on elucidating the associated signaling pathways and gene interaction mechanism to better utilize gene resources for regulating fruit traits. However, the availability of specific database of genes related to fruit traits for use by the plant research community remains limited. To address this limitation, we developed the Gene Improvements for Fruit Trait Database (GIFTdb, http://giftdb.agroda.cn).

35186035,TRmir: A Comprehensive Resource for Human Transcriptional Regulatory Information of MiRNAs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which play important roles in regulating various biological functions. Many available miRNA databases have provided a large number of valuable resources for miRNA investigation. However, not all existing databases provide comprehensive information regarding the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs, especially typical enhancer, super-enhancer (SE), and chromatin accessibility regions. An increasing number of studies have shown that the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs, as well as related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transcription factors (TFs) have a strong influence on human diseases and biological processes. Here, we developed a comprehensive database for the human transcriptional regulation of miRNAs (TRmir), which is focused on providing a wealth of available resources regarding the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs and annotating their potential roles in the regulation of miRNAs. TRmir contained a total of 5,754,414 typical enhancers/SEs and 1,733,966 chromatin accessibility regions associated with 1,684 human miRNAs. These regions were identified from over 900 human H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and DNase-seq samples. Furthermore, TRmir provided detailed (epi)genetic information about the transcriptional regulatory regions of miRNAs, including TFs, common SNPs, risk SNPs, linkage disequilibrium (LD) SNPs, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), 3D chromatin interactions, and methylation sites, especially supporting the display of TF binding sites in the regulatory regions of over 7,000 TF ChIP-seq samples.

38643090,GenoMycAnalyzer: a web-based tool for species and drug resistance prediction for Mycobacterium genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major threat to global public health. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a useful tool for species identification and drug resistance prediction, and many clinical laboratories are transitioning to WGS as a routine diagnostic tool. However, user-friendly and high-confidence automated bioinformatics tools are needed to rapidly identify M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), detect drug resistance, and further guide treatment options.<h4>Results</h4>We developed GenoMycAnalyzer, a web-based software that integrates functions for identifying MTBC and NTM species, lineage and spoligotype prediction, variant calling, annotation, drug-resistance determination, and data visualization. The accuracy of GenoMycAnalyzer for genotypic drug susceptibility testing (gDST) was evaluated using 5,473 MTBC isolates that underwent phenotypic DST (pDST). The GenoMycAnalyzer database was built to predict the gDST for 15 antituberculosis drugs using the World Health Organization mutational catalogue. Compared to pDST, the sensitivity of drug susceptibilities by the GenoMycAnalyzer for first-line drugs ranged from 95.9% for rifampicin (95% CI 94.8-96.7%) to 79.6% for pyrazinamide (95% CI 76.9-82.2%), whereas those for second-line drugs ranged from 98.2% for levofloxacin (95% CI 90.1-100.0%) to 74.9% for capreomycin (95% CI 69.3-80.0%). Notably, the integration of large deletions of the four resistance-conferring genes increased gDST sensitivity. The specificity of drug susceptibilities by the GenoMycAnalyzer ranged from 98.7% for amikacin (95% CI 97.8-99.3%) to 79.5% for ethionamide (95% CI 76.4-82.3%). The incorporated Kraken2 software identified 1,284 mycobacterial species with an accuracy of 98.8%. GenoMycAnalyzer also perfectly predicted lineages for 1,935 MTBC and spoligotypes for 54 MTBC.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GenoMycAnalyzer offers both web-based and graphical user interfaces, which can help biologists with limited access to high-performance computing systems or limited bioinformatics skills.

40494646,ThermoSeek: An Integrated Web Resource for Sequence and Structural Analysis of Proteins from Thermophilic Species.,"Protein engineering is a critical area within biotechnology, with enhancing protein thermal stability posing a significant challenge. Proteins from organisms adapted to extreme temperatures, such as thermophiles and psychrophiles, exhibit remarkable thermal stability. Analyzing their amino acid sequences, three-dimensional structures, and key residues provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of thermal adaptation. Traditional sequence alignment methods are used to identify homologous proteins in thermophiles, while recent advancements in protein structure prediction, particularly with AlphaFold2, have enabled more effective homology searches based on three-dimensional structures. In response to these advancements, we developed ThermoSeek, a web-accessible database integrating protein sequences, predicted structures, and key residues from both thermophilic and psychrophilic organisms. ThermoSeek offers three primary search modes: motif search, sequence alignment, and fold search, allowing researchers to explore protein adaptation to different thermal environments. These modes enable comparisons of query proteins with thermally stable proteins from diverse thermal conditions, investigating sequence homology, local residue environments (motifs), and fold similarity. To demonstrate its utility, we conducted case studies using ThermoSeek to search for thermophilic homologues of the PETases enzyme. This resource provides a comprehensive platform for understanding protein adaptation mechanisms across varying thermal environments and for optimizing enzyme stability.

CSCs have been demonstrated to elicit an important role in cancer recurrence, metastasis and drug resistance. CSCs are distinguished from cancer cell populations based on their molecular profiling or expression of distinct CSC biomarker(s). Recently, a huge amount of omics data have been generated for the characterization of CSCs, which enables distinguishing CSCs in different cancers. Here, we report biomarkers of the Cancer Stem Cells database (BCSCdb), a repository of information about CSC biomarkers. BCSCdb comprises CSC biomarkers collected from PubMed literature where these are identified using high-throughput and low-throughput methods. Each biomarker is provided with two different scores: the first is a confidence score to give confidence to reported CSC biomarkers based on the experimental method of detection in CSCs. The second is the global score to identify the global CSC biomarkers across 10 different types of cancer. This database contains three tables containing information about experimentally validated CSC biomarkers or genes, therapeutic target genes of CSCs and CSC biomarkers interactions. It contains information on three types of markers: high-throughput marker (HTM-8307), high-throughput marker validated by the low-throughput method (283) and low-throughput marker (LTM-525). A total of 171 low-throughput biomarkers were identified in primary tissue referred to as clinical biomarkers. Moreover, it contains 445 target genes for CSC therapeutics, 10 biomarkers targeted by clinical trial drugs in CSCs and 5 different types of interaction data for CSC biomarkers.

However, mapping tools that existed for microbial multi-omics data analysis cannot satisfy the needs of data description and result in high learning costs, complex dependencies, and high fees for researchers in experimental biology fields. Therefore, developing a toolkit for multi-omics data is essential for microbiologists to save effort. In this work, we developed MicrobioSee, a real-time interactive visualization tool based on web technologies, which could visualize microbial multi-omics data. It includes 17 modules surrounding the major omics data of microorganisms such as the transcriptome, metagenome, and proteome. With MicrobioSee, methods for plotting are simplified in multi-omics studies, such as visualization of diversity, ROC, and enrichment pathways for DEGs. Subsequently, three case studies were chosen to represent the functional application of MicrobioSee.

In contrast to previous work in Affective Computing, which pursued a single ""ground truth"" label for the affective content of each moment of each video (e.g., by averaging the ratings of 2 to 7 trained participants), we embrace the subjectivity inherent to emotional experiences and provide the full distribution of all participants' ratings (with an average of 76.7 raters per video). We argue that this choice represents a paradigm shift with the potential to unlock new research directions, generate new hypotheses, and inspire novel methods in the Affective Computing community. We also describe several interdisciplinary use cases for the database: to provide dynamic norms for emotion elicitation studies (e.g., in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience), to train and test affective content analysis algorithms (e.g., for dynamic emotion recognition, video summarization, and movie recommendation), and to study subjectivity in emotional reactions (e.g., to identify moments of emotional ambiguity or ambivalence within movies, identify predictors of subjectivity, and develop personalized affective content analysis algorithms).

38889117,CAManim: Animating end-to-end network activation maps.,"Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in numerous domains due to their high performance and accessibility to developers and application-specific end-users. Fundamental to image-based applications is the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which possess the ability to automatically extract features from data. However, comprehending these complex models and their learned representations, which typically comprise millions of parameters and numerous layers, remains a challenge for both developers and end-users. This challenge arises due to the absence of interpretable and transparent tools to make sense of black-box models. There exists a growing body of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) literature, including a collection of methods denoted Class Activation Maps (CAMs), that seek to demystify what representations the model learns from the data, how it informs a given prediction, and why it, at times, performs poorly in certain tasks. We propose a novel XAI visualization method denoted CAManim that seeks to simultaneously broaden and focus end-user understanding of CNN predictions by animating the CAM-based network activation maps through all layers, effectively depicting from end-to-end how a model progressively arrives at the final layer activation. Herein, we demonstrate that CAManim works with any CAM-based method and various CNN architectures. Beyond qualitative model assessments, we additionally propose a novel quantitative assessment that expands upon the Remove and Debias (ROAD) metric, pairing the qualitative end-to-end network visual explanations assessment with our novel quantitative ""yellow brick ROAD"" assessment (ybROAD). This builds upon prior research to address the increasing demand for interpretable, robust, and transparent model assessment methodology, ultimately improving an end-user's trust in a given model's predictions.

Over the decades, stratified research and clinical trials have uncovered crucial drug-related information-such as dosage, effectiveness, and side effects-affecting specific individuals with particular genetic backgrounds. This genetic-specific knowledge, characterized by complex multirelationships and conditions, cannot be adequately represented or stored in conventional knowledge systems. To address these challenges, we developed CPMKG, a condition-based platform that enables comprehensive knowledge representation. Through information extraction and meticulous curation, we compiled 307 614 knowledge entries, encompassing thousands of drugs, diseases, phenotypes (complications/side effects), genes, and genomic variations across four key categories: drug side effects, drug sensitivity, drug mechanisms, and drug indications. CPMKG facilitates drug-centric exploration and enables condition-based multiknowledge inference, accelerating knowledge discovery through three pivotal applications. To enhance user experience, we seamlessly integrated a sophisticated large language model that provides textual interpretations for each subgraph, bridging the gap between structured graphs and language expressions.

35776535,PHILM2Web: A high-throughput database of macromolecular host-pathogen interactions on the Web.,"During infection, the pathogen's entry into the host organism, breaching the host immune defense, spread and multiplication are frequently mediated by multiple interactions between the host and pathogen proteins. Systematic studying of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) is a challenging task for both experimental and computational approaches and is critically dependent on the previously obtained knowledge about these interactions found in the biomedical literature. While several HPI databases exist that manually filter HPI protein-protein interactions from the generic databases and curated experimental interactomic studies, no comprehensive database on HPIs obtained from the biomedical literature is currently available. Here, we introduce a high-throughput literature-mining platform for extracting HPI data that includes the most comprehensive to date collection of HPIs obtained from the PubMed abstracts. Our HPI data portal, PHILM2Web (Pathogen-Host Interactions by Literature Mining on the Web), integrates an automatically generated database of interactions extracted by PHILM, our high-precision HPI literature-mining algorithm. Currently, the database contains 23 581 generic HPIs between 157 host and 403 pathogen organisms from 11 609 abstracts. The interactions were obtained from processing 608 972 PubMed abstracts, each containing mentions of at least one host and one pathogen organisms. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we also utilized PHILM to process 25 796 PubMed abstracts obtained by the same query as the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. This COVID-19 processing batch resulted in 257 HPIs between 19 host and 31 pathogen organisms from 167 abstracts.

Although thousands of ncRNAs have been discovered, the transcriptional mechanisms and networks of the majority of ncRNAs have not been fully investigated. In this study, we updated ChIPBase to version 3.0 (https://rnasysu.com/chipbase3/) to provide the most comprehensive transcriptional regulation atlas of ncRNAs and protein-coding genes (PCGs). ChIPBase has identified ∼151 187 000 regulatory relationships between ∼171 600 genes and ∼3000 regulators by analyzing ∼55 000 ChIP-seq datasets, which represent a 30-fold expansion. Moreover, we de novo identified ∼29 000 motif matrices of transcription factors. In addition, we constructed a novel 'Enhancer' module to predict ∼1 837 200 regulation regions functioning as poised, active or super enhancers under ∼1300 conditions. Importantly, we constructed exhaustive coexpression maps between regulators and their target genes by integrating expression profiles of ∼65 000 normal and ∼15 000 tumor samples. We built a 'Disease' module to obtain an atlas of the disease-associated variations in the regulation regions of genes. We also constructed an 'EpiInter' module to explore potential interactions between epitranscriptome and epigenome.

RNA-sequencing data from human tissues has shown that this process can be inaccurate, resulting in the presence of novel introns detected at low frequency across samples and within an individual. To enable the full spectrum of intron use to be explored, we have developed IntroVerse, which offers an extensive catalogue on the splicing of 332,571 annotated introns and a linked set of 4,679,474 novel junctions covering 32,669 different genes. This dataset has been generated through the analysis of 17,510 human control RNA samples from 54 tissues provided by the Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium. IntroVerse has two unique features: (i) it provides a complete catalogue of novel junctions and (ii) each novel junction has been assigned to a specific annotated intron. This unique, hierarchical structure offers multiple uses, including the identification of novel transcripts from known genes and their tissue-specific usage, and the assessment of background splicing noise for introns thought to be mis-spliced in disease states.

37054878,VT3D: a visualization toolbox for 3D transcriptomic data.,"Data visualization empowers researchers to communicate their results that support scientific reasoning in an intuitive way. Three-dimension (3D) spatially resolved transcriptomic atlases constructed from multi-view and high-dimensional data have rapidly emerged as a powerful tool to unravel spatial gene expression patterns and cell type distribution in biological samples, revolutionizing the understanding of gene regulatory interactions and cell niches. However, limited accessible tools for data visualization impede the potential impact and application of this technology. Here we introduce VT3D, a visualization toolbox that allows users to explore 3D transcriptomic data, enabling gene expression projection to any 2D plane of interest, 2D virtual slice creation and visualization, and interactive 3D data browsing with surface model plots. In addition, it can either work on personal devices in standalone mode or be hosted as a web-based server. We apply VT3D to multiple datasets produced by the most popular techniques, including both sequencing-based approaches (Stereo-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and Slide-seq) and imaging-based approaches (MERFISH and STARMap), and successfully build a 3D atlas database that allows interactive data browsing. We demonstrate that VT3D bridges the gap between researchers and spatially resolved transcriptomics, thus accelerating related studies such as embryogenesis and organogenesis processes.

Over the past two decades, thousands of high-throughput sequencing studies in pigs have been performed using a variety of tissues from different breeds and developmental stages. However, multi-omics databases specifically designed for pig functional genomics research are still limited. Here, we present PIGOME, a user-friendly database of pig multi-omes. PIGOME currently contains seven types of pig omics datasets, including whole-genome sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq), and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), from 6901 samples and 392 projects with manually curated metadata, integrated gene annotation, and quantitative trait locus information.

However, the heterogeneity of TcEV remains poorly understood due to technical limitations of EV analysis and the lack of comprehensive data. To address this, we constructed TcEVdb, a comprehensive database that explores the expression and cluster of TcEV by the SEVtras method from T-cell single-cell RNA sequencing data. TcEVdb contains 277 265 EV droplets from 51 T-cell types across 221 samples from 21 projects, covering 9 tissue sources and 23 disease conditions. The database provides two main functional modules. The Browse module enables users to investigate EV secretion activity indices across samples, visualize TcEV clusters, analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathway enrichment in TcEV subpopulations, and compare TcEV transcriptomes with their cellular origins. The Search module allows users to query specific genes across all datasets and visualize their expression distribution. Furthermore, our analysis of TcEV in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma revealed increased EV secretion in CD4+ T exhausted cells compared to healthy controls. Subsequent analyses identified distinct droplet clusters with differential expression genes, including clusters enriched for genes associated with cell motility and mitochondrial function. Overall, TcEVdb serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring the transcriptome of TcEV, which will contribute to advancements in EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of diseases.

In recent years, a large and growing body of literature has investigated ferroptosis. Since ferroptosis is associated with various physiological activities and regulated by a variety of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial activity, ferroptosis has been closely related to the occurrence and development of many diseases, including cancer, aging, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemia-reperfusion injury and other pathological cell death. The regulation of ferroptosis mainly focuses on three pathways: system Xc-/GPX4 axis, lipid peroxidation and iron metabolism. The genes involved in these processes were divided into driver, suppressor and marker. Importantly, small molecules or drugs that mediate the expression of these genes are often good treatments in the clinic.

In response to the necessity for a specialized tool to study MTIs in cancer and normal tissues, we developed AmiCa (https://amica.omics.si/), a web server designed for comprehensive analysis of mature microRNA (miRNA) and gene expression in 32 cancer types. Data from 9498 tumor samples and 626 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas were obtained through the Genomic Data Commons and used to calculate differential expression and miRNA-target gene (MTI) correlations. AmiCa provides data on differential expression of miRNAs/genes for cancers for which normal tissue samples were available. In addition, the server calculates and presents correlations separately for tumor and normal samples for cancers for which normal samples are available. Furthermore, it enables the exploration of miRNA/gene expression in all cancer types with different miRNA/gene expression.

38365724,POSEIDON: Peptidic Objects SEquence-based Interaction with cellular DOmaiNs: a new database and predictor.,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short chains of amino acids that have shown remarkable potential to cross the cell membrane and deliver coupled therapeutic cargoes into cells. Designing and testing different CPPs to target specific cells or tissues is crucial to ensure high delivery efficiency and reduced toxicity. However, in vivo/in vitro testing of various CPPs can be both time-consuming and costly, which has led to interest in computational methodologies, such as Machine Learning (ML) approaches, as faster and cheaper methods for CPP design and uptake prediction. However, most ML models developed to date focus on classification rather than regression techniques, because of the lack of informative quantitative uptake values. To address these challenges, we developed POSEIDON, an open-access and up-to-date curated database that provides experimental quantitative uptake values for over 2,300 entries and physicochemical properties of 1,315 peptides. POSEIDON also offers physicochemical properties, such as cell line, cargo, and sequence, among others. By leveraging this database along with cell line genomic features, we processed a dataset of over 1,200 entries to develop an ML regression CPP uptake predictor. Our results demonstrated that POSEIDON accurately predicted peptide cell line uptake, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.87, Spearman correlation of 0.88, and r<sup>2</sup> score of 0.76, on an independent test set. With its comprehensive and novel dataset, along with its potent predictive capabilities, the POSEIDON database and its associated ML predictor signify a significant leap forward in CPP research and development. The POSEIDON database and ML Predictor are available for free and with a user-friendly interface at https://moreiralab.com/resources/poseidon/ , making them valuable resources for advancing research on CPP-related topics.

As a dynamic process, O-GlcNAc functions in a site-specific manner. However, the experimental identification of the O-GlcNAc sites remains challenging in many scenarios. Herein, by leveraging the recent progress in cataloguing experimentally identified O-GlcNAc sites and advanced deep learning approaches, we establish an ensemble model, O-GlcNAcPRED-DL, a deep learning-based tool, for the prediction of O-GlcNAc sites. In brief, to make a benchmark O-GlcNAc data set, we extracted the information on O-GlcNAc from the recently constructed database O-GlcNAcAtlas, which contains thousands of experimentally identified and curated O-GlcNAc sites on proteins from multiple species. To overcome the imbalance between positive and negative data sets, we selected five groups of negative data sets in humans and mice to construct an ensemble predictor based on connection of a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory. By taking into account three types of sequence information, we constructed four network frameworks, with the systematically optimized parameters used for the models. The thorough comparison analysis on two independent data sets of humans and mice and six independent data sets from other species demonstrated remarkably increased sensitivity and accuracy of the O-GlcNAcPRED-DL models, outperforming other existing tools.

35039845,ADENet: a novel network-based inference method for prediction of drug adverse events.,"Identification of adverse drug events (ADEs) is crucial to reduce human health risks and improve drug safety assessment. With an increasing number of biological and medical data, computational methods such as network-based methods were proposed for ADE prediction with high efficiency and low cost. However, previous network-based methods rely on the topological information of known drug-ADE networks, and hence cannot make predictions for novel compounds without any known ADE. In this study, we introduced chemical substructures to bridge the gap between the drug-ADE network and novel compounds, and developed a novel network-based method named ADENet, which can predict potential ADEs for not only drugs within the drug-ADE network, but also novel compounds outside the network. To show the performance of ADENet, we collected drug-ADE associations from a comprehensive database named MetaADEDB and constructed a series of network-based prediction models. These models obtained high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values ranging from 0.871 to 0.947 in 10-fold cross-validation. The best model further showed high performance in external validation, which outperformed a previous network-based and a recent deep learning-based method. Using several approved drugs as case studies, we found that 32-54% of the predicted ADEs can be validated by the literature, indicating the practical value of ADENet.

36350608,Annotation and evaluation of base editing outcomes in multiple cell types using CRISPRbase.,"CRISPR-Cas base editing (BE) system is a powerful tool to expand the scope and efficiency of genome editing with single-nucleotide resolution. The editing efficiency, product purity, and off-target effect differ among various BE systems. Herein, we developed CRISPRbase (http://crisprbase.maolab.org), by integrating 1 252 935 records of base editing outcomes in more than 50 cell types from 17 species. CRISPRbase helps to evaluate the putative editing precision of different BE systems by integrating multiple annotations, functional predictions and a blasting system for single-guide RNA sequences. We systematically assessed the editing window, editing efficiency and product purity of various BE systems. Intensive efforts were focused on increasing the editing efficiency and product purity of base editors since the byproduct could be detrimental in certain applications. Remarkably, more than half of cancer-related off-target mutations were non-synonymous and extremely damaging to protein functions in most common tumor types. Luckily, most of these cancer-related mutations were passenger mutations (4840/5703, 84.87%) rather than cancer driver mutations (863/5703, 15.13%), indicating a weak effect of off-target mutations on carcinogenesis.

36350627,NLRscape: an atlas of plant NLR proteins.,"NLRscape is a webserver that curates a collection of over 80 000 plant protein sequences identified in UniProtKB to contain NOD-like receptor signatures, and hosts in addition a number of tools aimed at the exploration of the complex sequence landscape of this class of plant proteins. Each entry gathers sequence information, domain and motif annotations from multiple third-party sources but also in-house advanced annotations aimed at addressing caveats of the existing broad-based annotations. NLRscape provides a top-down perspective of the NLR sequence landscape but also services for assisting a bottom-up approach starting from a given input sequence. Sequences are clustered by their domain organization layout, global homology and taxonomic spread-in order to allow analysis of how particular traits of an NLR family are scattered within the plant kingdom. Tools are provided for users to locate their own protein of interest in the overall NLR landscape, generate custom clusters centered around it and perform a large number of sequence and structural analyses using included interactive online instruments. Amongst these, we mention: taxonomy distribution plots, homology cluster graphs, identity matrices and interactive MSA synchronizing secondary structure and motif predictions.

40348330,TopCysteineDB: A Cysteinome-wide Database Integrating Structural and Chemoproteomics Data for Cysteine Ligandability Prediction.,"Development of targeted covalent inhibitors and covalent ligand-first approaches have emerged as a powerful strategy in drug design, with cysteines being attractive targets due to their nucleophilicity and relative scarcity. While structural biology and chemoproteomics approaches have generated extensive data on cysteine ligandability, these complementary data types remain largely disconnected. Here, we present TopCysteineDB, a comprehensive resource integrating structural information from the PDB with chemoproteomics data from activity-based protein profiling experiments. Analysis of the complete PDB yielded 264,234 unique cysteines, while the proteomics dataset encompasses 41,898 detectable cysteines across the human proteome. Using TopCovPDB, an automated classification pipeline complemented by manual curation, we identified 787 covalent cysteines and systematically categorized other functional roles, including metal-binding, cofactor-binding, and disulfide bonds. Mapping residue-wise structural information to sequence space enabled cross-referencing between structural and proteomics data, creating a unified view of cysteine ligandability. For TopCySPAL, a machine learning model was developed, integrating structural features and proteomics data, achieving strong predictive performance (AUROC: 0.964, AUPRC: 0.914) and robust generalization to novel cases. TopCysteineDB and TopCySPAL are freely accessible through a webinterface, TopCysteineDBApp (https://topcysteinedb.hhu.de/), designed to facilitate exploration of cysteine sites across the human proteome. The interface provides an interactive visualization featuring a color-coded mapping of chemoproteomics data onto cysteine site structures and the highlighting of identified peptide sequences.

36350638,tatDB: a database of Ago1-mediated targets of transfer RNA fragments.,"tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are a class of emerging post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression likely binding to the transcripts of target genes. However, only a few tRFs targets have been experimentally validated, making it hard to extrapolate the functions or binding mechanisms of tRFs. The paucity of resources supporting the identification of the targets of tRFs creates a bottleneck in the fast-developing field. We have previously analyzed chimeric reads in crosslinked Argonaute1-RNA complexes to help infer the guide-target pairs and binding mechanisms of multiple tRFs based on experimental data in human HEK293 cells. To efficiently disseminate these results to the research community, we designed a web-based database tatDB (targets of tRFs DataBase) populated with close to 250 000 experimentally determined guide-target pairs with ∼23 000 tRF isoforms. tatDB has a user-friendly interface with flexible query options/filters allowing one to obtain comprehensive information on given tRFs (or targets). Modes of interactions are supported by secondary structures of potential guide-target hybrids and binding motifs, essential for understanding the targeting mechanisms of tRFs. Further, we illustrate the value of the database on an example of hypothesis-building for a tRFs potentially involved in the lifecycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. tatDB is freely accessible at https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb.",True,False,4.5,,,tatdb,16.0,ok,,targets of trfs database | argets of trfs database,,spacy,0.0,tatDB,True,6.0,True,True,https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb,https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb,True,...e SARS-CoV-2 virus. tatDB is freely accessible at https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb.,1

Through our continued efforts to harmonise and import data received from GWAS authors and consortia, and data sets actively collected from public sources, the database now contains over 72.5 million P-values for over 5000 studies testing over 7.4 million unique genetic markers investigating over 1700 unique phenotypes. Here, we describe an update to integrate this extensive data collection with mouse disease model data to support insights into the functional impact of human genetic variation. GWAS Central has expanded to include mouse gene-phenotype associations observed during mouse gene knockout screens. To allow similar cross-species phenotypes to be compared, terms from mammalian and human phenotype ontologies have been mapped. New interactive interfaces to find, correlate and view human and mouse genotype-phenotype associations are included in the website toolkit.

35842742,PlantPhoneDB: A manually curated pan-plant database of ligand-receptor pairs infers cell-cell communication.,"Ligand-receptor pairs play important roles in cell-cell communication for multicellular organisms in response to environmental cues. Recently, the emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate cellular communication based on ligand-receptor expression. However, so far, no reliable ligand-receptor interaction database is available for plant species. In this study, we developed PlantPhoneDB (https://jasonxu.shinyapps.io/PlantPhoneDB/), a pan-plant database comprising a large number of high-confidence ligand-receptor pairs manually curated from seven resources. Also, we developed a PlantPhoneDB R package, which not only provided optional four scoring approaches that calculate interaction scores of ligand-receptor pairs between cell types but also provided visualization functions to present analysis results. At the PlantPhoneDB web interface, the processed datasets and results can be searched, browsed, and downloaded. To uncover novel cell-cell communication events in plants, we applied the PlantPhoneDB R package on GSE121619 dataset to infer significant cell-cell interactions of heat-shocked root cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a result, the PlantPhoneDB predicted the actively communicating AT1G28290-AT2G14890 ligand-receptor pair in atrichoblast-cortex cell pair in Arabidopsis thaliana. Importantly, the downstream target genes of this ligand-receptor pair were significantly enriched in the ribosome pathway, which facilitated plants adapting to environmental changes.

36694725,CAFuncAPA: a knowledgebase for systematic functional annotations of APA events in human cancers.,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread posttranscriptional regulation process. APA generates diverse mRNA isoforms with different 3' UTR lengths, affecting mRNA expression, miRNA binding regulation and alternative splicing events. Previous studies have demonstrated the important roles of APA in tumorigenesis and cancer progression through diverse aspects. Thus, a comprehensive functional landscape of diverse APA events would aid in a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms related to APA in human cancers. Here, we built CAFuncAPA (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/CAFuncAPA/) to systematically annotate the functions of 15478 APA events in human pan-cancers. Specifically, we first identified APA events associated with cancer survival and tumor progression. We annotated the potential downstream effects of APA on genes/isoforms expression, regulation of miRNAs, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and alternative splicing events. Moreover, we also identified up-regulators of APA events, including the effects of genetic variants on poly(A) sites and RBPs, as well as the effect of methylation phenotypes on APA events.

Genomics continues to accelerate our exploration of gene diversity and orthology is the most precise way of bridging gene functional knowledge with the rapidly expanding universe of genomic sequences. OrthoDB samples the most diverse organisms with the best quality genomics data to provide the leading coverage of species diversity. This update of the underlying data to over 18 000 prokaryotes and almost 2000 eukaryotes with over 100 million genes propels the coverage to another level. This achievement also demonstrates the scalability of the underlying OrthoLoger software for delineation of orthologs, freely available from https://orthologer.ezlab.org. In addition to the ab-initio computations of gene orthology used for the OrthoDB release, the OrthoLoger software allows mapping of novel gene sets to precomputed orthologs and thereby links to their annotations.

Whilst the number of single-cell sequencing studies is increasing dramatically; however, data mining and reanalysis remains challenging. Herein, we systematically curated the up-to-date and most comprehensive datasets of sequencing data originating from 2760 bulk samples and over 5.1 million single-cells from multiple developmental periods from humans and multiple model organisms. With unified and systematic analysis, we profiled the gene expression and chromatin accessibility among 481 cell-types, 79 tissue-types and 92 timepoints, and pinpointed cells with the co-expression of target genes. We also enabled the detection of gene(s) with a temporal and cell-type specific expression profile that is similar to or distinct from that of a target gene. Additionally, we illustrated the potential upstream and downstream gene-gene regulation interactions, particularly under the same biological process(es) or KEGG pathway(s). Thus, TEDD (Temporal Expression during Development Database), a value-added database with a user-friendly interface, not only enables researchers to identify cell-type/tissue-type specific and temporal gene expression and chromatin profiles but also facilitates the association of genes with undefined biological functions in development and diseases.

35695435,MolHyb: A Web Server for Structure-Based Drug Design by Molecular Hybridization.,"Molecular hybridization is a widely used ligand design method in drug discovery. In this study, we present MolHyb, a web server for structure-based ligand design by molecular hybridization. The input of MolHyb is a protein file and a seed compound file. MolHyb tries to generate novel ligands through hybridizing the seed compound with helper compounds that bind to the same protein target or similar proteins. To facilitate the job of getting helper compounds, we compiled a modeled protein-ligand structure database as an extension to crystal structures in the PDB database by placing the bioactive compounds in ChEMBL into their corresponding 3D protein binding pocket properly. MolHyb works by searching for helper compounds from the protein-ligand structure database and migrating chemical moieties from helper compounds to the seed compound efficiently. Hybridization is performed at both cyclic and acyclic bonds. The users can also input their own helper compounds to MolHyb. We hope that MolHyb will be a useful tool for rational drug design.

33237866,SEDA: A Desktop Tool Suite for FASTA Files Processing.,"SEDA (SEquence DAtaset builder) is a multiplatform desktop application for the manipulation of FASTA files containing DNA or protein sequences. The convenient graphical user interface gives access to a collection of simple (filtering, sorting, or file reformatting, among others) and advanced (BLAST searching, protein domain annotation, gene annotation, and sequence alignment) utilities not present in similar applications, which eases the work of life science researchers working with DNA and/or protein sequences, especially those who have no programming skills. This paper presents general guidelines on how to build efficient data handling protocols using SEDA, as well as practical examples on how to prepare high-quality datasets for single gene phylogenetic studies, the characterization of protein families, or phylogenomic studies. The user-friendliness of SEDA also relies on two important features: (i) the availability of easy-to-install distributable versions and installers of SEDA, including a Docker image for Linux, and (ii) the facility with which users can manage large datasets.

However, the massive omics data have not been extensively mined and integrated. Here, we describe CyanoOmicsDB (http://www.cyanoomics.cn/), a database aiming to provide comprehensive functional information for each cyanobacterial gene. CyanoOmicsDB consists of 8 335 261 entries of cyanobacterial genes from 928 genomes. It provides multiple gene identifiers, visualized genomic location, and DNA sequences for each gene entry.

The identification of gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns can provide valuable insights into ongoing biological processes, such as the cell cycle, cell development, circadian rhythms, or responses to external stimuli such as drug treatments or viral infections. However, currently, no database defines, identifies or archives gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns. Here, using a high-throughput regression analysis approach, eight linear and nonlinear parametric models were fitted to gene expression profiles from time-series experiments to identify eight types of gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns. We curated 2684 time-series transcriptome datasets and identified 2644,370 gene profiles exhibiting temporal-specific expression patterns. The results were stored in the database GeTeSEPdb (gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns database, http://www.inbirg.com/GeTeSEPdb/). Moreover, we implemented an online tool to identify gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns from user-submitted data. In summary, GeTeSEPdb is a comprehensive web service that can be used to identify and analyse gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns.

36367311,MGTdb: a web service and database for studying the global and local genomic epidemiology of bacterial pathogens.,"Multilevel genome typing (MGT) enables the genomic characterization of bacterial isolates and the relationships among them. The MGT system describes an isolate using multiple multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes, referred to as levels. Thus, for a new isolate, sequence types (STs) assigned at multiple precisely defined levels can be used to type isolates at multiple resolutions. The MGT designation for isolates is stable, and the assignment is faster than the existing approaches. MGT's utility has been demonstrated in multiple species. This paper presents a publicly accessible web service called MGTdb, which enables the assignment of MGT STs to isolates, along with their storage, retrieval and analysis. The MGTdb web service enables upload of genome data as sequence reads or alleles, which are processed and assigned MGT identifiers. Additionally, any newly sequenced isolates deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Sequence Read Archive are also regularly retrieved (currently daily), processed, assigned MGT identifiers and made publicly available in MGTdb. Interactive visualization tools are presented to assist analysis, along with capabilities to download publicly available isolates and assignments for use with external software. MGTdb is currently available for Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis and Vibrio cholerae. We demonstrate the usability of MGTdb through three case studies - to study the long-term national surveillance of S. Typhimurium, the local epidemiology and outbreaks of S.

39316480,Subjective Quality Assessment of Compressed Tone-Mapped High Dynamic Range Videos.,"High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos are able to represent wider ranges of contrasts and colors than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos, giving more vivid experiences. Due to this, HDR videos are expected to grow into the dominant video modality of the future. However, HDR videos are incompatible with existing SDR displays, which form the majority of affordable consumer displays on the market. Because of this, HDR videos must be processed by tone-mapping them to reduced bit-depths to service a broad swath of SDR-limited video consumers. Here, we analyze the impact of tone-mapping operators on the visual quality of streaming HDR videos. To this end, we built the first large-scale subjectively annotated open-source database of compressed tone-mapped HDR videos, containing 15,000 tone-mapped sequences derived from 40 unique HDR source contents. The videos in the database were labeled with more than 750,000 subjective quality annotations, collected from more than 1,600 unique human observers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new subjective database by benchmarking objective models of visual quality on it. We envision that the new LIVE Tone-Mapped HDR (LIVE-TMHDR) database will enable significant progress on HDR video tone mapping and quality assessment in the future.

36318256,CRdb: a comprehensive resource for deciphering chromatin regulators in human.,"Chromatin regulators (CRs) regulate epigenetic patterns on a partial or global scale, playing a critical role in affecting multi-target gene expression. As chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data associated with CRs are rapidly accumulating, a comprehensive resource of CRs needs to be built urgently for collecting, integrating, and processing these data, which can provide abundant annotated information on CR upstream and downstream regulatory analyses as well as CR-related analysis functions. This study established an integrative CR resource, named CRdb (http://cr.liclab.net/crdb/), with the aim of curating a large number of available resources for CRs and providing extensive annotations and analyses of CRs to help biological researchers clarify the regulation mechanism and function of CRs. The CRdb database comprised a total of 647 CRs and 2,591 ChIP-seq samples from more than 300 human tissues and cell types. These samples have been manually curated from NCBI GEO/SRA and ENCODE. Importantly, CRdb provided the abundant and detailed genetic annotations in CR-binding regions based on ChIP-seq. Furthermore, CRdb supported various functional annotations and upstream regulatory information on CRs. In particular, it embedded four types of CR regulatory analyses: CR gene set enrichment, CR-binding genomic region annotation, CR-TF co-occupancy analysis, and CR regulatory axis analysis.

Given the complex regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis and the lack of centralized expression data resources for this important pathogen, a database integrating diverse experimental conditions is essential for understanding its biology and developing control strategies. Public RNA sequencing data were used to quantify gene expression abundance for 604 A. flavus samples from 52 experiments. Using abundance data, we created an AFED accessible through a web-based interface that allows for the expression profiles of genes to be conveniently examined across different growth conditions and life cycle stages. Expression profiles can be visualized through either an interactive bar plot for single gene queries or a heatmap for multiple gene queries.

However, it is increasingly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without a bioinformatic background, to integrate, explore, and analyse these tremendous pharmacogenomics. To address this gap, IMOPAC, an interactive and easy-to-use web-based tool, was introduced to provide rapid visualizations and customizable functionalities on the basis of these three publicly available databases, which may reduce pharmacogenomic profiles from cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, transcriptionomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological events. The user-friendly query interface together with customized data storage enables users to interactively investigate and visualize multiomics alterations across genes and pathways and to link these alterations with drug responses across cell lines from diverse cancer types. The analyses in our portal include pancancer expression, drug-omics/pathway correlation, cancer subtypes, omics-omics (cis-/trans-regulation) correlation, fusion query analysis, and drug response prediction analysis. The comprehensive multiomics and pharmacogenomic analyses with simple clicking through IMOPAC will significantly benefit cancer precision medicine, contribute to the discoveries of potential biological mechanisms and facilitate pharmacogenomics mining in the identification of clinically actionable biomarkers for both basic researchers and clinical practitioners.

40234091,PCI-DB: a novel primary tissue immunopeptidome database to guide next-generation peptide-based immunotherapy development.,"<h4>Background</h4>Various cancer immunotherapies rely on the T cell-mediated recognition of peptide antigens presented on human leukocyte antigens (HLA). However, the identification and selection of naturally presented peptide targets for the development of personalized as well as off-the-shelf immunotherapy approaches remain challenging.<h4>Methods</h4>Over 10,000 raw mass spectrometry (MS) files from over 3,000 tissue samples were analyzed, summing to approximately seven terabytes of data. The raw MS data were processed using the standardized and open-source nf-core pipelines MHCquant2 and epitopeprediction, providing a uniform procedure for data handling. A global false discovery rate was applied to minimize false-positive identifications.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce the open-access Peptides for Cancer Immunotherapy Database (PCI-DB, https://pci-db.org/), a comprehensive resource of immunopeptidome data originating from various malignant and benign primary tissues that provides the research community with a convenient tool to facilitate the identification of peptide targets for immunotherapy development. The PCI-DB includes >6.6 million HLA class I and >3.4 million HLA class II peptides from over 40 tissue types and cancer entities. First application of the database provided insights into the representation of cancer-testis antigens across malignant and benign tissues, enabling the identification and characterization of cross-tumor entity and entity-specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as well as naturally presented neoepitopes from frequent cancer mutations. Further, we used the PCI-DB to design personalized peptide vaccines for two patients suffering from metastatic cancer. In a retrospective analysis, PCI-DB enabled the composition of both a multi-peptide vaccine comprising non-mutated, highly frequent TAAs matching the immunopeptidome of the individual patient's tumor and a neoepitope-based vaccine matching the mutational profile of a patient with cancer. Both vaccine approaches induced potent and long-lasting T-cell responses, accompanied by long-term survival of these patients with advanced cancer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The PCI-DB provides a highly versatile tool to broaden the understanding of cancer-related antigen presentation and, ultimately, supports the development of novel immunotherapies.",True,False,3.5,,,pci-db,16.0,ok,,peptides for cancer immunotherapy database,,spacy,0.0,PCI-DB,True,6.0,True,True,https://pci-db.org/,https://pci-db.org/,True,"...ptides for Cancer Immunotherapy Database (PCI-DB, https://pci-db.org/), a comprehensive resource of immunopeptidome dat...",1

Data visualization tools linking to the knowledgebase enhance user interaction with content and accelerate phenotype development.<h4>Discussion</h4>The CIPHER knowledgebase was developed in the largest healthcare system in the United States and piloted with external partners. The design of the CIPHER website supports a variety of front-end tools and features to facilitate phenotype development and reuse. Health data users are encouraged to contribute their algorithms to the knowledgebase for wider dissemination to the research community, and to use the platform as a springboard for phenotyping.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CIPHER is a public resource for all health data users available at https://phenomics.va.ornl.gov/ which facilitates phenotype reuse, development, and dissemination of phenotyping knowledge.",True,False,4.5,,centralized interactive phenomics resource,,16.0,ok,,,cipher | ipher,spacy,0.0,Centralized Interactive Phenomics Resource,True,3.0,True,True,https://phenomics.va.ornl.gov/,https://phenomics.va.ornl.gov/,True,"...c resource for all health data users available at https://phenomics.va.ornl.gov/ which facilitates phenotype reuse, development, a...",1
35368077,cSurvival: a web resource for biomarker interactions in cancer outcomes and in cell lines.,"Survival analysis is a technique for identifying prognostic biomarkers and genetic vulnerabilities in cancer studies. Large-scale consortium-based projects have profiled >11 000 adult and >4000 pediatric tumor cases with clinical outcomes and multiomics approaches. This provides a resource for investigating molecular-level cancer etiologies using clinical correlations. Although cancers often arise from multiple genetic vulnerabilities and have deregulated gene sets (GSs), existing survival analysis protocols can report only on individual genes. Additionally, there is no systematic method to connect clinical outcomes with experimental (cell line) data. To address these gaps, we developed cSurvival (https://tau.cmmt.ubc.ca/cSurvival). cSurvival provides a user-adjustable analytical pipeline with a curated, integrated database and offers three main advances: (i) joint analysis with two genomic predictors to identify interacting biomarkers, including new algorithms to identify optimal cutoffs for two continuous predictors; (ii) survival analysis not only at the gene, but also the GS level; and (iii) integration of clinical and experimental cell line studies to generate synergistic biological insights. To demonstrate these advances, we report three case studies. We confirmed findings of autophagy-dependent survival in colorectal cancers and of synergistic negative effects between high expression of SLC7A11 and SLC2A1 on outcomes in several cancers. We further used cSurvival to identify high expression of the Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway as a main indicator for lung cancer prognosis and for cellular resistance to oxidative stress-inducing drugs.

It is believed that bioisosteric know-how may help bypass granted patents or generate novel intellectual property for commercialization. Beside the synthetic expertise, the drug discovery process also depends on efficient in silico tools. We hereby present BioisoIdentifier (BII), a web server aiming to uncover bioisosteric information for specific fragment. Using the Protein Data Bank as source, and specific substructures that the user attempt to surrogate as input, BII tries to find suitable fragments that fit well within the local protein active site. BII is a powerful computational tool that offers the ligand design ideas for bioisosteric replacing. For the validation of BII, catechol is conceived as model fragment attempted to be replaced, and many ideas are successfully offered. These outputs are hierarchically grouped according to structural similarity, and clustered based on unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In summary, we constructed a user-friendly interface to enable the viewing of top-ranking molecules for further experimental exploration. This makes BII a highly valuable tool for drug discovery.

One problem faced by researchers trying to answer them is the absence of a comprehensive database with sequences from nonbilaterians. Publicly available data are plentiful but scattered and often not associated with proper metadata. A new database presented in this paper, LukProt, is an attempt at solving this issue. The database contains protein sequences obtained mostly from genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic studies and is an extension of EukProt (Richter DJ, Berney C, Strassert JFH, Poh Y-P, Herman EK, Muñoz-Gómez SA, Wideman JG, Burki F, de Vargas C. EukProt: a database of genome-scale predicted proteins across the diversity of eukaryotes. Peer Community J. 2022:2:e56. https://doi.org/10.24072/pcjournal.173). LukProt adopts the EukProt naming conventions and includes data from 216 additional animals. The database is associated with a taxonomic grouping (taxogroup) scheme suitable for studying early animal evolution. Minor updates to the database will contain species additions or metadata corrections, whereas major updates will synchronize LukProt to each new version of EukProt, and releases are permanently stored on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7089120).

39693568,scEccDNAdb: an integrated single-cell eccDNA resource for human and mouse.,"Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA), an extrachromosomal circular structured DNA, is extensively found in eukaryotes. Investigating eccDNA at the single-cell level is crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity, evolution, development, and specific cellular functions. However, high-throughput identification methods for single-cell eccDNA are complex, and the lack of mature, widely applicable technologies has resulted in limited resources. To address this gap, we built scEccDNAdb, a database based on single-cell whole-genome sequencing data. It contains 3 195 464 single-cell eccDNA entries from human and mouse samples, with annotations including oncogenes, typical enhancers, super-enhancers, CCCTC-binding factor-binding sites, single nucleotide polymorphisms, chromatin accessibility, expression quantitative trait loci, transcription factor binding sites, motifs, and structural variants.

37465397,ZooPathWeb: a comprehensive web resource for zoonotic pathogens.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Zoonotic pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, can be transmitted from animals to humans, causing a wide range of diseases that can vary from mild to life-threatening. These pathogens typically exhibit a broad host range, infecting domestic and/or wild animals, which serve as reservoirs of infection. Human infection can occur through direct contact with infected animals or their body fluids, consumption of contaminated food or water, or via bites from infected arthropod vectors. Understanding the epidemiological characteristics and population structure of zoonotic pathogens is of paramount importance for preventing and controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present ZooPathWeb, a comprehensive online resource for zoonotic pathogens. ZooPathWeb provides essential information on pathogens that are particularly relevant to public health and includes a literature collection organized by pathogen classification, such as lineage, host, country or region and publication year. Moreover, we have developed four web-based utility tools for this release: SeqNHandle, PaPhy-ML, TreeView and BLAST. These tools are specifically designed to facilitate the identification of population structure and adaptive evolution in relation to zoonotic pathogens.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The ZooPathWeb website is accessed via http://lab.malab.cn/~hrs/zoopathweb/.

PubMed search displays ~ 146,000 studies on HLA reported from diverse locations. Currently, IPD-IMGT/HLA (Robinson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 48:D948-D955, 2019) database houses data on 28,320 HLA alleles. We developed an automated pipeline with a unified graphical user interface HLA-SPREAD that provides a structured information on SNPs, Populations, REsources, ADRs and Diseases information. Information on HLA was extracted from ~ 28 million PubMed abstracts extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Python scripts were used to mine and curate information on diseases, filter false positives and categorize to 24 tree hierarchical groups and named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithms followed by semantic analysis to infer HLA association(s). This resource from 109 countries and 40 ethnic groups provides interesting insights on: markers associated with allelic/haplotypic association in autoimmune, cancer, viral and skin diseases, transplantation outcome and ADRs for hypersensitivity.

CIDs are characterised by shared and disease-specific processes, which is reflected by partially overlapping genetic risk maps and pathogenic cells (e.g., T cells). Their pathogenesis involves a plethora of intracellular pathways. The translation of the research findings on CIDs molecular mechanisms into effective treatments is challenging and may explain the low remission rates despite modern targeted therapies. Modelling CID-related causal interactions as networks allows us to tackle the complexity at a systems level and improve our understanding of the interplay of key pathways. Here we report the construction, description, and initial applications of the SYSCID map (https://syscid.elixir-luxembourg.org/), a mechanistic causal interaction network covering the molecular crosstalk between IBD, RA and SLE. We demonstrate that the map serves as an interactive, graphical review of IBD, RA and SLE molecular mechanisms, and helps to understand the complexity of omics data.

35614082,"MusMorph, a database of standardized mouse morphology data for morphometric meta-analyses.","Complex morphological traits are the product of many genes with transient or lasting developmental effects that interact in anatomical context. Mouse models are a key resource for disentangling such effects, because they offer myriad tools for manipulating the genome in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, phenotypic data are often obtained using laboratory-specific protocols, resulting in self-contained datasets that are difficult to relate to one another for larger scale analyses. To enable meta-analyses of morphological variation, particularly in the craniofacial complex and brain, we created MusMorph, a database of standardized mouse morphology data spanning numerous genotypes and developmental stages, including E10.5, E11.5, E14.5, E15.5, E18.5, and adulthood. To standardize data collection, we implemented an atlas-based phenotyping pipeline that combines techniques from image registration, deep learning, and morphometrics. Alongside stage-specific atlases, we provide aligned micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available) for each specimen (N = 10,056).

Though Illumina still dominates worldwide sequencing, Oxford Nanopore is one of the leading technologies currently being used by biologists, medics and geneticists across various applications. Oxford Nanopore is automated and relatively simple for conducting experiments, but generates gigabytes of raw data, to be processed by often ambiguous set of alternative bioinformatics command-line tools, and genomics frameworks which require a knowledge of bioinformatics to run.<h4>Results</h4>We established an inter-collegiate collaboration across experimentalists and bioinformaticians in order to provide a novel bioinformatics tool, free for academics. This tool allows people without extensive bioinformatics knowledge to simply process their raw genome sequencing data. Currently, due to ICT resources' maintenance reasons, our server is only capable of handling small genomes (up to 15 Mb).

40037809,PhaSeDis: A Manually Curated Database of Phase Separation-disease Associations and Corresponding Small Molecules.,"Biomacromolecules form membraneless organelles through liquid-liquid phase separation in order to regulate the efficiency of particular biochemical reactions. Dysregulation of phase separation might result in pathological condensation or sequestration of biomolecules, leading to diseases. Thus, phase separation and phase separating factors may serve as drug targets for disease treatment. Nevertheless, such associations have not yet been integrated into phase separation-related databases. Therefore, based on MloDisDB, a database for membraneless organelle factor-disease associations previously developed by our lab, we constructed PhaSeDis, the phase separation-disease association database. We increased the number of phase separation entries from 52 to 185, and supplemented the evidence provided by the original articles verifying the phase separation nature of the factors. Moreover, we included the information of interacting small molecules with low-throughput or high-throughput evidence that might serve as potential drugs for phase separation entries. PhaSeDis strives to offer comprehensive descriptions of each entry, elucidating how phase separating factors induce pathological conditions via phase separation and the mechanisms by which small molecules intervene. We believe that PhaSeDis would be very important in the application of phase separation regulation in treating related diseases.

They share seven transmembrane helices organized in an up-down bundle architecture. GPCR-mediated signaling pathways have been linked to numerous human diseases, and GPCRs are the targets of approximately 35% of all drugs currently on the market. Structure network analysis, a graph theory-based approach, represents a cutting-edge tool to deeply understand GPCR function, which strongly relies on communication between the extracellular and intracellular poles of their structure. psnGPCRdb stores the structure networks (i.e., linked nodes, hubs, communities and communication pathways) computed on all updated GPCR structures in the Protein Data Bank, in their isolated states or in complex with extracellular and/or intracellular molecules. The structure communication signatures of a sub-family or family of GPCRs as well as of their small-molecule activators or inhibitors are stored as consensus networks. The database stores also all meaningful structure network-based comparisons (i.e., difference networks) of functionally different states (i.e., inactive or active) of a given receptor sub-type, or of consensus networks representative of a receptor sub-type, type, sub-family or family. Single or consensus GPCR networks hold also information on amino acid conservation. The database allows to graphically analyze 3D structure networks together with interactive data-tables.

38629186,DREAMweb: An online tool for graph-based modeling of NMR protein structure.,"The value of accurate protein structural models closely conforming to the experimental data is indisputable. DREAMweb deploys an improved DREAM algorithm, DREAMv2, that incorporates a tighter bound in the constraint set of the underlying optimization approach. This reduces the artifacts while modeling the protein structure by solving the distance-geometry problem. DREAMv2 follows a bottom-up strategy of building smaller substructures for regions with a larger concentration of experimental bounds and consolidating them before modeling the rest of the protein structure. This improves secondary structure conformance in the final models consistent with experimental data. The proposed method efficiently models regions with sparse coverage of experimental data by reducing the possibility of artifacts compared to DREAM. To balance performance and accuracy, smaller substructures (  ∼ 200 $\sim 200$  atoms) are solved in this regime, allowing faster builds for the other parts under relaxed conditions. DREAMweb is accessible as an internet resource. The improvements in results are showcased through benchmarks on 10 structures. DREAMv2 can be used in tandem with any NMR-based protein structure determination workflow, including an iterative framework where the NMR assignment for the NOESY spectra is incomplete or ambiguous.

36630461,MAGNET: A web-based application for gene set enrichment analysis using macrophage data sets.,"Characterization of gene lists obtained from high-throughput genomic experiments is an essential task to uncover the underlying biological insights. A common strategy is to perform enrichment analyses that utilize standardized biological annotations, such as GO and KEGG pathways, which attempt to encompass all domains of biology. However, this approach provides generalized, static results that may fail to capture subtleties associated with research questions within a specific domain. Thus, there is a need for an application that can provide precise, relevant results by leveraging the latest research. We have therefore developed an interactive web application, Macrophage Annotation of Gene Network Enrichment Tool (MAGNET), for performing enrichment analyses on gene sets that are specifically relevant to macrophages. Using the hypergeometric distribution, MAGNET assesses the significance of overlapping genes with annotations that were curated from published manuscripts and data repositories. We implemented numerous features that enhance utility and user-friendliness, such as the simultaneous testing of multiple gene sets, different visualization options, option to upload custom datasets, and downloadable outputs. Here, we use three example studies compared against our current database of ten publications on mouse macrophages to demonstrate that MAGNET provides relevant and unique results that complement conventional enrichment analysis tools.

A considerable part of these data has been published previously in a number of papers; however, most of these data have yet to be presented. These records cover a significant part of the range of many rodent species in Southeast Asia and provide new data on their distribution. The data were obtained during a number of different field expeditions, where some animals were caught by the author and some were provided by other researchers, resulting in different accuracy levels of geographic coordinates and altitude estimates may range from 10 to 1000 metres in area and from 1 to 100 metres for elevation. A number of samples were genetically examined to avoid inconsistencies with the taxonomic identification. With the help of colleagues, the author created a set of georeferenced occurrence records, adapted to the controlled vocabulary of Darwin Core format datasets, removed duplicates and standardised the format of records using commonly-used unified data structure. This paper presents the resulting dataset of rodents (mostly of Muridae and Sciuridae) along with other small terrestrial species (Scandentia Tupaidae) occurrence records in the territory of Vietnam and Laos.<h4>New information</h4>Much of the distribution data are currently available as open source GBIF databases and potentially may be combined into a united framework for better data resolution. The dataset presented here combines occurrence records of many species over a significant part of their recent natural range, in Vietnam and Laos. The author presents a validated and comprehensive dataset of rodents' occurrence records, based on genetic samples collection compiled during 15 years working in Vietnam (from 2007 to date). Prior to this project, a considerable part of the information about Vietnamese rodents was not available to a wide range of researchers to use these spatial data for analyses by modern methods, for example, for analysis based on geographic information systems (GIS technologies). This dataset now is available for any researchers who use the data format prepared in accordance with Darwin Core standards.For different countries of Southeast Asia and beyond, there are a lot of additional occurrence records for a number of species listed here which may be combined, but a considerable part of them is still scattered over a number of separate literary sources, while another is still presented as maps, field notes and huge amount of museum zoological collections records. The final set was created by a combination of species occurrence records and uniform data structure with verification of the samples' geographic coordinates. Most samples were genetically or/and morphologically verified for correct taxonomical identification, because the most part of the samples presented was carefully investigated by the author himself, both for morphology and genetic attribution. Therefore, the dataset expands the available information on the spatial and temporal distribution of a number of small mammals' species in Southeast Asia. All original notes and geographical localities were carefully checked and any duplicate and erroneous records have been removed from the final dataset.To the date of publication of these data, the GBIF database https://www.gbif.org contained 1408 rodent occurrence records from Vietnam (Fig. 1) along with 240 Scandentia records (Fig. 2), primarily the data on museum materials, including four large collections, such as the Field Museum of Natural History (Zoology) Mammal Collection (646 samples), Australian National Wildlife Collection provider for OZCAM (537), MVZ Mammal Collection Arctos (109), Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University (69) and six other minor collections comprising single specimens.Actually, as for the small terrestrial mammals, Vietnam remains one of the least representative regions in Southeast Asia. Here, we present new data containing 2408 occurrence records, including 2237 rodent records, along with 171 Scandentia ones (Fig. 3).

40185904,PsycGM: a comprehensive database for associations between gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders pose substantial global burdens on public health, yet therapeutic options remain limited. Recently, gut microbiota is in the spotlight of new research on psychiatric disorders, as emerging discoveries have highlighted the importance of gut microbiome in the regulation of central nervous system via mediating the gut-brain-axis bidirectional communication. While metagenomics studies have accumulated for psychiatric disorders, few systematic efforts were dedicated to integrating these high-throughput data across diverse phenotypes, interventions, geographical regions, and biological species. To present a panoramic view of global data and provide a comprehensive resource for investigating the gut microbiota dysbiosis in psychiatric disorders, we developed the PsycGM, a manually curated and well-annotated database that provides the literature-supported associations between gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders or intervention measures. In total, PsycGM incorporated 559 studies from 31 countries worldwide, encompassing research involving humans, rats, mice, and non-human primates. PsycGM documented 8907 curated associations between 1514 gut microbial taxa and 11 psychiatric disorders, as well as 4050 associations between 869 taxa and 232 microbiota-based and non-microbiota-based interventions. Moreover, PsycGM provided a user-friendly web interface with comprehensive information, enabling browsing, retrieving and downloading of all entries. In the application of PsycGM, we panoramically depicted the intestinal microecological imbalance in depression. Additionally, we identified 9 microbial taxa consistently altered in patients with depression, with the most common dysregulations observed for Parabacteroides, Alistipes, and Faecalibacterium; in animal models of depression, consistent changes were observed in 21 microbial taxa, most frequently reported as Helicobacter, Lactobacillus, Roseburia, and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes.

35876977,FEAMR: A Database for Surveillance of Food and Environment-Associated Antimicrobial Resistance.,"The rapid dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a serious health problem on an unprecedented global scale. AMR is predicted to kill more than 10 million people annually by 2050 leading to huge economic losses worldwide. Therefore, urgent action is required at the national as well as international levels to avert this looming crisis. Effective surveillance can play an important role in the containment of AMR spread by providing data to help determine AMR hotspots, predict an outbreak, maintain proper stewardship and propose immediate and future plans of action in this respect. Although many existing databases provide genetic and molecular information on AMR in microorganisms, there is no dedicated database of AMR from non-clinical samples. The FEAMR database is a one-of-its-kind database to provide manually collated and curated information on the prevalence of AMR in food and the environment. For designing the FEAMR webpage, Microsoft Visual Studio with HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, Bootstrap for the front-end and C# for the back-end were used. The FEAMR database is a free access resource ( https://feamrudbt-amrlab.mu.ac.in/ ), accepting verified food- and environment-related AMR submissions from across the globe. To the best of our knowledge, it is probably the first database providing AMR-related surveillance data from non-clinical samples. It is designed from the 'One Health Approach' perspective to help in the containment of global AMR spread. Flowsheet of steps for making FEAMR database 1. Research articles relating to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) were searched on the internet. 2. Data relating to AMR were retrieved from these articles and stored in an MS-Excel sheet. 3. The web pages of the FEAMR database (DB) were created using Microsoft Visual Studio (MVS) and its various tools. HTML, CSS, ASP.NET and Bootstrap were used for the front end and C# used for the back-end of the website. 4. The DB of FEAMR was created using MS SQL Server which was controlled by SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 5. The data from the MS-Excel sheet in step 2 was stored in the SQL server and displayed on the web page using GridView tool of MVS and C#.

The main objective is to facilitate the accessibility and reusability of the rapidly growing <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> omics data and relevant annotation. To achieve these goals, we performed manual curation on the transcriptome data and organized the datasets in an experiment-centric manner. We collected unknown operons annotated through text-mining analysis that would provide more clues about how <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> modulates gene regulation. Meanwhile, to understand the relationship between genes or experiments, we performed gene co-expression analysis and experiment-experiment correlation analysis. In additional, functional module named ""Interactions"" which dedicates to collecting experimentally validated interactions about <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> from public databases, MEDLINE documents and literature in life science journals. To date, Mr.Vc v2, which is significantly increased from the previous version, contains 107 microarray experiments, 106 RNA-seq experiments, and 3 Tn-seq projects, covering 56,839 entries of DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) from transcriptomes and 7,463 related genes from Tn-seq, respectively. and a total of 270,129 gene co-expression entries and 11,990 entries of experiment-experiment correlation was obtained, in total 1,316 entries of interactions were collected, including 496 protein-chemical signaling molecule interactions, 472 protein-protein interactions, 306 TF (Transcription Factor)-gene interactions and 42 <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>-virus interactions, most of which obtained from 402 literature through text-mining analysis.

In this context, we developed OrthoMaM, a database of ORTHOlogous MAmmalian Markers describing the evolutionary dynamics of coding sequences in mammalian genomes. OrthoMaM version 12 includes 15,868 alignments of orthologous coding sequences (CDS) from the 190 complete mammalian genomes currently available. All annotations and 1-to-1 orthology assignments are based on NCBI. Orthologous CDS can be mined for potential informative markers at the different taxonomic levels of the mammalian tree. To this end, several evolutionary descriptors of DNA sequences are provided for querying purposes (e.g. base composition and relative substitution rate). The graphical web interface allows the user to easily browse and sort the results of combined queries. The corresponding multiple sequence alignments and ML trees, inferred using state-of-the art approaches, are available for download both at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. OrthoMaM v12 can be used by researchers interested either in reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of mammalian taxa or in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of coding sequences in their genomes.

MINRbase provides interactive access to the profiles of 130 238 expressed rRFs arising from the four human nuclear rRNAs (18S, 5.8S, 28S, 5S), two mitochondrial rRNAs (12S, 16S) or four spacers of 45S pre-rRNA. We compiled these profiles by analyzing 11 632 datasets, including the GEUVADIS and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repositories. MINRbase offers a user-friendly interface that lets researchers issue complex queries based on one or more criteria, such as parental rRNA identity, nucleotide sequence, rRF minimum abundance and metadata keywords (e.g. tissue type, disease). A 'summary' page for each rRF provides a granular breakdown of its expression by tissue type, disease, sex, ancestry and other variables; it also allows users to create publication-ready plots at the click of a button. MINRbase has already allowed us to generate support for three novel observations: the internal spacers of 45S are prolific producers of abundant rRFs; many abundant rRFs straddle the known boundaries of rRNAs; rRF production is regimented and depends on 'personal attributes' (sex, ancestry) and 'context' (tissue type, tissue state, disease).

37843152,TCOD: an integrated resource for tropical crops.,"Tropical crops are vital for tropical agriculture, with resource scarcity, functional diversity and extensive market demand, providing considerable economic benefits for the world's tropical agriculture-producing countries. The rapid development of sequencing technology has promoted a milestone in tropical crop research, resulting in the generation of massive amount of data, which urgently needs an effective platform for data integration and sharing. However, the existing databases cannot fully satisfy researchers' requirements due to the relatively limited integration level and untimely update. Here, we present the Tropical Crop Omics Database (TCOD, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/tcod), a comprehensive multi-omics data platform for tropical crops. TCOD integrates diverse omics data from 15 species, encompassing 34 chromosome-level de novo assemblies, 1 255 004 genes with functional annotations, 282 436 992 unique variants from 2048 WGS samples, 88 transcriptomic profiles from 1997 RNA-Seq samples and 13 381 germplasm items.

Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) is a well-established mechanism for genomic imprinting and regulates imprinted gene expression. Previous studies have confirmed that certain special regions with ASM are susceptible and closely related to human carcinogenesis and plant development. In addition, recent studies have proven ASM to be an effective tumour marker. However, research on the functions of ASM in diseases and development is still extremely scarce. Here, we collected 4400 BS-Seq datasets and 1598 corresponding RNA-Seq datasets from 47 species, including human and mouse, to establish a comprehensive ASM database. We obtained the data on DNA methylation level, ASM and allele-specific expressed genes (ASEGs) and further analysed the ASM/ASEG distribution patterns of these species. In-depth ASM distribution analysis and differential methylation analysis conducted in nine cancer types showed results consistent with the reported changes in ASM in key tumour genes and revealed several potential ASM tumour-related genes.

However, collecting enough cells with the desired molecular phenotype in a single experiment is challenging, requiring several samples preprocessing steps to filter and collect the desired cells experimentally before sequencing. Data integration of multiple public single-cell experiments stands as a solution for this problem, allowing the collection of enough cells exhibiting the desired molecular signatures. By increasing the sample size of the desired cell type, this approach enables a robust cell type transcriptome characterization.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce rPanglaoDB, an R package to download and merge the uniformly processed and annotated scRNA-seq data provided by the PanglaoDB database. To show the potential of rPanglaoDB for collecting rare cell types by integrating multiple public datasets, we present a biological application collecting and characterizing a set of 157 fibrocytes. Fibrocytes are a rare monocyte-derived cell type, that exhibits both the inflammatory features of macrophages and the tissue remodeling properties of fibroblasts. This constitutes the first fibrocytes' unbiased transcriptome profile report. We compared the transcriptomic profile of the fibrocytes against the fibroblasts collected from the same tissue samples and confirm their associated relationship with healing processes in tissue damage and infection through the activation of the prostaglandin biosynthesis and regulation pathway.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>rPanglaoDB is implemented as an R package available through the CRAN repositories https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB.",True,False,5.0,,rpanglaodb | panglaodb,,16.0,conflict,,an r package to download and merge labeled single-cell rna-seq data from the panglaodb database. <h4>motivation</h4>characterizing cells with rare molecular phenotypes is one of the promises of high throughput single-cell rna sequencing | https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpanglaodb,cran,spacy,0.0,rPanglaoDB,True,6.0,False,False,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB,True,...R package available through the CRAN repositories https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB.,1

The database was developed by extracting data from pharmacological reviews of repeat-dose, carcinogenicity, developmental, and reproductive toxicity studies. In the database, observed and no-observed effects are linked to the respective effect levels, including information on severity/incidence and transiency/reversibility. It also includes some information on effects in humans, that were extracted from relevant sections of standard product labels of the approved drugs. The database is complemented with a specific ontology for reporting effects that was developed as an improved version of the Ontology Lookup Service's mammalian and human phenotype ontologies and includes different hierarchical levels. The developed ontology contains novel and unique standardized terms, including ontological terms for reproductive and endocrine effects. The database aims to facilitate correlation and concordance analyses based on the link between observed and no-observed effects and their respective effect levels. In addition, it offers a robust dataset on drug information for the pharmaceutical industry and research. The reported ontology supports the analyses of toxicological information, especially for reproductive and endocrine endpoints and can be used to encode legacy data or develop additional ontologies.

39514415,athisomiRDB: A comprehensive database of Arabidopsis isomiRs.,"Several pieces of evidence challenge the traditional view of miRNAs as static molecules, revealing dynamic isomiRs originating from each miRNA precursor arm. In plants, isomiRs, which result from imprecise cleavage during pre-miRNA processing and post-transcriptional alterations, serve as crucial regulators of target microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite numerous studies on Arabidopsis miRNAs, the systematic identification and annotation of isomiRs across various tissues and conditions remain limited. Due to the lack of systematically collected isomiR information, we introduce the athisomiRDB database, which houses 20 764 isomiRs from Arabidopsis small RNA-sequencing (sRNA-seq) libraries. It comprises >2700 diverse samples and allows exploration at the sample, miRNA, or isomiR levels, offering insights into the presence or absence of isomiRs. The athisomiRDB includes exclusive and ambiguous isomiRs, each with features such as transcriptional origin, variant-containing isomiRs, and identifiers for frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the 1001 Genomes Project. It also provides 3' nontemplated post-transcriptional additions, isomiR-target interactions, and trait associations for each isomiR.

38957398,KLSD: a kinase database focused on ligand similarity and diversity.,"Due to the similarity and diversity among kinases, small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) often display multi-target effects or selectivity, which have a strong correlation with the efficacy and safety of these inhibitors. However, due to the limited number of well-known popular databases and their restricted data mining capabilities, along with the significant scarcity of databases focusing on the pharmacological similarity and diversity of SMIKIs, researchers find it challenging to quickly access relevant information. The KLIFS database is representative of specialized application databases in the field, focusing on kinase structure and co-crystallised kinase-ligand interactions, whereas the KLSD database in this paper emphasizes the analysis of SMKIs among all reported kinase targets. To solve the current problem of the lack of professional application databases in kinase research and to provide centralized, standardized, reliable and efficient data resources for kinase researchers, this paper proposes a research program based on the ChEMBL database. It focuses on kinase ligands activities comparisons. This scheme extracts kinase data and standardizes and normalizes them, then performs kinase target difference analysis to achieve kinase activity threshold judgement. It then constructs a specialized and personalized kinase database platform, adopts the front-end and back-end separation technology of SpringBoot architecture, constructs an extensible WEB application, handles the storage, retrieval and analysis of the data, ultimately realizing data visualization and interaction.

Biological functions in organisms are often accomplished through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which help to regulate interacting proteins or organize them into an integral machine. However, the study of PPIs in cyanobacteria falls far behind that in mammals and has not been integrated for ease of use. Thus, we built CyanoMapDB (http://www.cyanomapdb.msbio.pro/), a database providing cyanobacterial PPIs with experimental evidence, consisting of 52,304 PPIs among 6,789 proteins from 23 cyanobacterial species.

35664227,SSRTool: A web tool for evaluating RNA secondary structure predictions based on species-specific functional interpretability.,"RNA secondary structures can carry out essential cellular functions alone or interact with one another to form the hierarchical tertiary structures. Experimental structure identification approa ches can show the <i>in vitro</i> structures of RNA molecules. However, they usually have limits in the resolution and are costly. <i>In silico</i> structure prediction tools are thus primarily relied on for pre-experiment analysis. Various structure prediction models have been developed over the decades. Since these tools are usually used before knowing the actual RNA structures, evaluating and ranking the pile of secondary structure predictions of a given sequence is essential in computational analysis. In this research, we implemented a web service called SSRTool (RNA Secondary Structure prediction Ranking Tool) to assist in the ranking and evaluation of the generated predicted structures of a given sequence. Based on the computed species-specific interpretability significance in four common RNA structure-function aspects, SSRTool provides three functions along with visualization interfaces: (1) Rank user-generated predictions. (2) Provide an automated streamline of structure prediction and ranking for a given sequence. (3) Infer the functional aspects of a given structure. We demonstrated the applicability of SSRTool via real case studies and reported the similar trends between computed species-specific rankings and the corresponding prediction F1 values.

35533187,LmTraceMap: A Listeria monocytogenes fast-tracing platform for global surveillance.,"Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, and people with hypoimmunity such as pregnant women, infants and fetuses are at high risk of invasive infection. Although the incidence of listeriosis is low, the fatality rate is high. Therefore, continual surveillance and rapid epidemiological investigation are crucial for addressing L. monocytogenes. Because of the popularity of next-generation sequencing, obtaining the whole-genome sequence of a bacterium is easy. Several genome-based typing methods are available, and core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) is the most recognized methods.

40268234,GPCRchimeraDB: A Database of Chimeric G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) to Assist Their Design.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins crucial to numerous diseases, yet many remain poorly characterized and untargeted by drugs. Chimeric GPCRs have emerged as valuable tools for elucidating GPCR function by facilitating the identification of signaling pathways, resolving structures, and discovering novel ligands of poorly understood GPCRs. Such chimeric GPCRs are obtained by merging a well- and less-well-characterized GPCR at the intracellular limits of their transmembrane regions or intracellular loops, leveraging knowledge transfer from the well-characterized GPCR. However, despite the engineering of over 200 chimeric GPCRs to date, the design process remains largely trial-and-error and lacks a standardized approach. To address this gap, we introduce GPCRchimeraDB (https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/), the first comprehensive database dedicated to chimeric GPCRs. It catalogs 212 chimeric receptors, identified through literature review, and includes 1,755 class A natural GPCRs, enabling connections between chimeras and their parent receptors while facilitating the exploration of novel parent combinations. Both chimeric and natural GPCR entries are extensively described at the sequence, structural, and biophysical level through a range of visualization tools, with annotations from resources like UniProt and GPCRdb and predictions from AlphaFold2 and b2btools. Additionally, GPCRchimeraDB offers a GPCR sequence aligner and a feature comparator to investigate differences between natural and chimeric receptors. It also provides design guidelines to support rational chimera engineering. GPCRchimeraDB is therefore a resource to facilitate and optimize the design of new chimeras, so helping to gain insights into poorly characterized receptors and contributing to advances in GPCR therapeutic development.",True,False,4.0,,gpcrchimeradb | g protein,,16.0,conflict,,https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/ | uniprot,gpcrdb,spacy,0.0,GPCRchimeraDB,True,6.0,False,False,https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/ | http://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/,https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/,True,"...To address this gap, we introduce GPCRchimeraDB (https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/), the first comprehensive database dedicated to c...",1

38531599,ESKtides: a comprehensive database and mining method for ESKAPE phage-derived antimicrobial peptides.,"'Superbugs' have received increasing attention from researchers, such as ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.), which directly led to about 1 270 000 death cases in 2019. Recently, phage peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs)-derived antimicrobial peptides were proposed as new antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, there is still a lack of methods for mining antimicrobial peptides based on phages or phage PGHs. Here, by using a collection of 6809 genomes of ESKAPE isolates and corresponding phages in public databases, based on a unified annotation process of all the genomes, PGHs were systematically identified, from which peptides were mined. As a result, a total of 12 067 248 peptides with high antibacterial activities were respectively determined. A user-friendly tool was developed to predict the phage PGHs-derived antimicrobial peptides from customized genomes, which also allows the calculation of peptide phylogeny, physicochemical properties, and secondary structure.

40186419,mirTarCLASH: a comprehensive miRNA target database based on chimeric read-based experiments.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can target messenger RNAs to control their degradation or translation repression effects. Therefore, identifying the target and binding sites of different miRNAs is essential for understanding miRNA functions. To investigate these interactions, researchers have employed the cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH-seq) and similar CLASH-like approaches to generate chimeric reads formed by miRNAs and their targeting segments. These chimeric reads allow for the direct extraction of both the miRNA-target gene pairs and their corresponding binding sites. Nevertheless, these studies lack user-friendly platforms for researchers to investigate these interactions efficiently, thus hindering scientists' ability to explore miRNA functions. To address this gap, we developed mirTarCLASH, a comprehensive database that deposits 502 061/322 707/224 452 unique hybrid reads from human/mouse/worm miRNA chimeric read-based experiments. In mirTarCLASH, the chimera analysis algorithm ChiRA and two distinct binding site inference tools, RNAup and miRanda, were adopted to facilitate the exploration of miRNA-target pairs derived from CLASH-like experiments. Compared with existing similar repositories, mirTarCLASH further enables several confidence evaluation filters with visualization functions for the extracted results. The results can be further refined based on the key properties of the miRNA targeting sites, including read depths, numbers of supporting algorithms, and cross-linking-induced mutations, to enhance confidence levels. In addition, these miRNA-binding sites are visually represented through an integrated transcript atlas. Finally, we demonstrated the biological applicability of mirTarCLASH via the well-characterized example interaction between cel-let-7-5p and lin-41 in Caenorhabditis elegans, showcasing the potential of mirTarCLASH to provide novel insights for subsequent experimental research designs.

37646936,TEMM: A Curated Data Resource for Transposon Element-Based Molecular Markers in Plants.,"Transposon elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that can insert themselves into new locations and modify the plant genome. In recent years, they have been used as molecular markers in plant breeding programs. TE-based molecular markers (TE-markers) are divided into two categories depending on the transcription mechanism of the TEs. The first category is retrotransposon-based molecular markers, which include RBIP, IRAP, REMAP, and iPBS. The second group is DNA-based-TE-markers, which include MITE, TE-junction, and CACTA TE-markers. These markers are a good tool for studying genetic diversity and can provide information on plants' phylogenetic and evolutionary history. They can help improve breeding programs to increase agronomic traits and develop new varieties. Overall, TE-markers play an important role in plant genetics and plant breeding and contribute to a better understanding of plant biology. Here, we present TEMM, a curated data resource for TE-markers in plants. Relevant research articles were screened to collect primer sequences and related information. Only articles containing primer sequences are added to the present data resource. TEMM contains 784 primers with their associated PCR reaction programs and their applications in various crops.

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a class of RNA transcripts that generally cannot encode proteins and have been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulating cancer stemness. Here, we developed the ncStem database to record manually curated and predicted ncRNAs associated with cancer stemness. In total, ncStem contains 645 experimentally verified entries, including 159 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 254 microRNAs (miRNAs), 39 circular RNAs (circRNAs), and 5 other ncRNAs. The detailed information of each entry includes the ncRNA name, ncRNA identifier, disease, reference, expression direction, tissue, species, and so on. In addition, ncStem also provides computationally predicted cancer stemness-associated ncRNAs for 33 TCGA cancers, which were prioritized using the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm based on regulatory and co-expression networks. The total predicted cancer stemness-associated ncRNAs included 11 132 lncRNAs and 972 miRNAs. Moreover, ncStem provides tools for functional enrichment analysis, survival analysis, and cell location interrogation for cancer stemness-associated ncRNAs.

Elucidating the genetic basis of BIP will play a pivotal role in mechanistic delineation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully reported multiple susceptibility loci conferring BIP risk, thus providing insight into the effects of its underlying pathobiology. However, difficulties remain in the extrication of important and biologically relevant data from genetic discoveries related to psychiatric disorders such as BIP. There is an urgent need for an integrated and comprehensive online database with unified access to genetic and multi-omics data for in-depth data mining. Here, we developed the dbBIP, a database for BIP genetic research based on published data. The dbBIP consists of several modules, i.e.: (i) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) module, containing large-scale GWAS genetic summary statistics and functional annotation information relevant to risk variants; (ii) gene module, containing BIP-related candidate risk genes from various sources and (iii) analysis module, providing a simple and user-friendly interface to analyze one's own data. We also conducted extensive analyses, including functional SNP annotation, integration (including summary-data-based Mendelian randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies), co-expression, gene expression, tissue expression, protein-protein interaction and brain expression quantitative trait loci analyses, thus shedding light on the genetic causes of BIP.

35254998,MDADP: A Webserver Integrating Database and Prediction Tools for Microbe-Disease Associations.,"More and more evidence has demonstrated that microbiota play important roles in the life processes of the human body. In recent years, various computational methods have been proposed for identifying potentially disease-associated microbes to save costs in traditional biological experiments. However, prediction performances of these methods are generally limited by outdated and incomplete datasets. And moreover, until now, there are limited studies that can provide visual predictive tools for inferring possible microbe-disease associations (MDAs) as well. Hence, in this manuscript, a novel webserver called MDADP will be proposed to identify latent MDAs, in which, a new MDA database together with interactive prediction tools for MDAs studies will be designed simultaneously. Especially, in the newly constructed MDA database, 2019 known MDAs between 58 diseases and 703 microbes have been manually collected first. And then, through adopting the average ranking method and the co-confidence method respectively, eight representative computational models have been integrated together to identify potential disease-related microbes. As a result, MDADP can provide not only interactive features for users to access and capture MDAs entities, but alsoeffective tools for users to identify candidate microbes for different diseases. To our knowledge, MDADP is the first online platform that incorporates a new MDA database with comprehensive MDA prediction tools.

39498494,StreptomeDB 4.0: a comprehensive database of streptomycetes natural products enriched with protein interactions and interactive spectral visualization.,"Streptomycetes remain an important bacterial source of natural products (NPs) with significant therapeutic promise, particularly in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Herein, we present StreptomeDB 4.0, a substantial update of the database that includes expanded content and several new features. Currently, StreptomeDB 4.0 contains over 8500 NPs originating from ∼3900 streptomycetes, manually annotated from ∼7600 PubMed-indexed peer-reviewed articles. The database was enhanced by two in-house developments: (i) automated literature-mined NP-protein relationships (hyperlinked to the CPRiL web server) and (ii) pharmacophore-based NP-protein interactions (predicted with the ePharmaLib dataset). Moreover, genome mining was supplemented through hyperlinks to the widely used antiSMASH database. To facilitate NP structural dereplication, interactive visualization tools were implemented, namely the JSpecView applet and plotly.js charting library for predicted nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectral data, respectively. Furthermore, both the backend database and the frontend web interface were redesigned, and several software packages, including PostgreSQL and Django, were updated to the latest versions. Overall, this comprehensive database serves as a vital resource for researchers seeking to delve into the metabolic intricacies of streptomycetes and discover novel therapeutics, notably antimicrobial agents.

35500907,Identification of Antibiotic Resistance Proteins via MiCId's Augmented Workflow. A Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics Approach.,"Fast and accurate identifications of pathogenic bacteria along with their associated antibiotic resistance proteins are of paramount importance for patient treatments and public health. To meet this goal from the mass spectrometry aspect, we have augmented the previously published <i>Mi</i>croorganism <i>C</i>lassification and <i>Id</i>entification (MiCId) workflow for this capability. To evaluate the performance of this augmented workflow, we have used MS/MS datafiles from samples of 10 antibiotic resistance bacterial strains belonging to three different species: <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The evaluation shows that MiCId's workflow has a sensitivity value around 85% (with a lower bound at about 72%) and a precision greater than 95% in identifying antibiotic resistance proteins. In addition to having high sensitivity and precision, MiCId's workflow is fast and portable, making it a valuable tool for rapid identifications of bacteria as well as detection of their antibiotic resistance proteins. It performs microorganismal identifications, protein identifications, sample biomass estimates, and antibiotic resistance protein identifications in 6-17 min per MS/MS sample using computing resources that are available in most desktop and laptop computers. We have also demonstrated other use of MiCId's workflow. Using MS/MS data sets from samples of two bacterial clonal isolates, one being antibiotic-sensitive while the other being multidrug-resistant, we applied MiCId's workflow to investigate possible mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in these pathogenic bacteria; the results showed that MiCId's conclusions agree with the published study.

Our goal is to build a structured public online knowledgebase describing the worldwide practice of DRGs, which includes systematic indicators for DRGs' performance assessment. Therefore, we manually collected the qualified literature from PUBMED and constructed DRGKB website. We divided the evaluation indicators into four categories, including (i) medical service quality; (ii) medical service efficiency; (iii) profitability and sustainability; (iv) case grouping ability. Then we carried out descriptive analysis and comprehensive scoring on outcome measurements performance, improvement strategy and specialty performance. At last, the DRGKB finally contains 297 entries. It was found that DRGs generally have a considerable impact on hospital operations, including average length of stay, medical quality and use of medical resources. At the same time, the current DRGs also have many deficiencies, including insufficient reimbursement rates and the ability to classify complex cases. We analyzed these underperforming parts by domain. In conclusion, this research innovatively constructed a knowledgebase to quantify the practice effects of DRGs, analyzed and visualized the development trends and area performance from a comprehensive perspective.

Accordingly, we collected and defined 236 007 gene sets across different categories for 44 plant species in the Plant Gene Set Annotation Database (PlantGSAD). These gene sets were divided into nine main categories covering many functional subcategories, such as trait ontology, co-expression modules, chromatin states, and liquid-liquid phase separation. The annotations from the collected gene sets covered all of the genes in the Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis and Poaceae species Oryza sativa. Several GSEA tools are implemented in PlantGSAD to improve the efficiency of the analysis, including custom SEA for a flexible strategy based on customized annotations, SEACOMPARE for the cross-comparison of SEA results, and integrated visualization features for ontological analysis that intuitively reflects their parent-child relationships. In summary, PlantGSAD provides numerous gene sets for multiple plant species and highly efficient analysis tools.

We discovered a group of hairpins, called cluster hairpins, present within 15 nucleotides from each other. These are expected to work in tandem to cause intrinsic transcription termination (ITT), while the single hairpin can do the same alone. Therefore, exploring these ITT sites and the hairpins across bacterial genomes becomes highly desirable. INTERPIN is the largest archived collection of in silico inferred ITT hairpins in bacteria, covering 12745 bacterial genomes and encompassing ten bacterial phyla for ∼25 million hairpins.

36582435,SeqCP: A sequence-based algorithm for searching circularly permuted proteins.,"Circular permutation (CP) is a protein sequence rearrangement in which the amino- and carboxyl-termini of a protein can be created in different positions along the imaginary circularized sequence. Circularly permutated proteins usually exhibit conserved three-dimensional structures and functions. By comparing the structures of circular permutants (CPMs), protein research and bioengineering applications can be approached in ways that are difficult to achieve by traditional mutagenesis. Most current CP detection algorithms depend on structural information. Because there is a vast number of proteins with unknown structures, many CP pairs may remain unidentified. An efficient sequence-based CP detector will help identify more CP pairs and advance many protein studies. For instance, some hypothetical proteins may have CPMs with known functions and structures that are informative for functional annotation, but existing structure-based CP search methods cannot be applied when those hypothetical proteins lack structural information. Despite the considerable potential for applications, sequence-based CP search methods have not been well developed. We present a sequence-based method, SeqCP, which analyzes normal and duplicated sequence alignments to identify CPMs and determine candidate CP sites for proteins. SeqCP was trained by data obtained from the Circular Permutation Database and tested with nonredundant datasets from the Protein Data Bank. It shows high reliability in CP identification and achieves an AUC of 0.9.

The BioSamples database now has a valuable set of features and processes to improve data quality in BioSamples, and in particular enriching metadata content and following FAIR principles. In this manuscript, we describe how BioSamples in 2021 handles requirements from our community of users through exemplar use cases: increased findability of samples and improved data management practices support the goals of the ReSOLUTE project, how the plant community benefits from being able to link genotypic to phenotypic information, and we highlight how cumulatively those improvements contribute to more complex multi-omics data integration supporting COVID-19 research. Finally, we present underlying technical features used as pillars throughout those use cases and how they are reused for expanded engagement with communities such as FAIRplus and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health.

37205123,TLSEA: a tool for lncRNA set enrichment analysis based on multi-source heterogeneous information fusion.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important regulatory role in gene transcription and post-transcriptional modification, and lncRNA regulatory dysfunction leads to a variety of complex human diseases. Hence, it might be beneficial to detect the underlying biological pathways and functional categories of genes that encode lncRNA. This can be carried out by using gene set enrichment analysis, which is a pervasive bioinformatic technique that has been widely used. However, accurately performing gene set enrichment analysis of lncRNAs remains a challenge. Most conventional enrichment analysis methods have not exhaustively included the rich association information among genes, which usually affects the regulatory functions of genes. Here, we developed a novel tool for lncRNA set enrichment analysis (TLSEA) to improve the accuracy of the gene functional enrichment analysis, which extracted the low-dimensional vectors of lncRNAs in two functional annotation networks with the graph representation learning method. A novel lncRNA-lncRNA association network was constructed by merging lncRNA-related heterogeneous information obtained from multiple sources with the different lncRNA-related similarity networks. In addition, the random walk with restart method was adopted to effectively expand the lncRNAs submitted by users according to the lncRNA-lncRNA association network of TLSEA. In addition, a case study of breast cancer was performed, which demonstrated that TLSEA could detect breast cancer more accurately than conventional tools.

36222201,KinMod database: a tool for investigating metabolic regulation.,"The ability of current kinetic models to simulate the phenotypic behaviour of cells is limited since cell metabolism is regulated at different levels including enzyme regulation. The small molecule regulation network (SMRN) enables cells to respond rapidly to environmental fluctuations by controlling the activity of enzymes in metabolic pathways. However, SMRN is not as well studied relative to metabolic networks. The main contributor to the lack of knowledge on this regulatory system is the sparsity of experimental data and the absence of a standard framework for representing available information. In this paper, we introduce the KinMod database that encompasses more than 2 million data points on the metabolism and metabolic regulation network of 9814 organisms KinMod database employs a hierarchical data structure to: (i) signify relationships between kinetic information obtained through in-vitro experiments and proteins, with an emphasis on SMRN, (ii) provide a thorough insight into available kinetic parameters and missing experimental measurements of this regulatory network and (iii) facilitate machine learning approaches for parameter estimation and accurate kinetic model construction by providing a homogeneous list of linked omics data. The hierarchical ontology of the KinMod database allows flexible exploration of data attributes and investigation of metabolic relationships within- and cross-species. Identifying missing experimental values suggests additional experiments required for kinetic parameter estimation. Linking multi-omics data and providing data on SMRN encourages the development of novel machine learning techniques for predicting missing kinetic parameters and promotes accurate kinetic model construction of cells metabolism by providing a comprehensive list of available kinetic measurements. To illustrate the value of KinMod data, we develop six analyses to visualize associations between data classes belonging to separate sections of the metabolism. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that the KinMod database provides a unique framework for biologists and engineers to retrieve, evaluate and compare the functional metabolism of species, including the regulatory network, and discover the extent of available and missing experimental values of the metabolic regulation.

38597890,NetMe 2.0: a web-based platform for extracting and modeling knowledge from biomedical literature as a labeled graph.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The rapid increase of bio-medical literature makes it harder and harder for scientists to keep pace with the discoveries on which they build their studies. Therefore, computational tools have become more widespread, among which network analysis plays a crucial role in several life-science contexts. Nevertheless, building correct and complete networks about some user-defined biomedical topics on top of the available literature is still challenging.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce NetMe 2.0, a web-based platform that automatically extracts relevant biomedical entities and their relations from a set of input texts-i.e. in the form of full-text or abstract of PubMed Central's papers, free texts, or PDFs uploaded by users-and models them as a BioMedical Knowledge Graph (BKG). NetMe 2.0 also implements an innovative Retrieval Augmented Generation module (Graph-RAG) that works on top of the relationships modeled by the BKG and allows the distilling of well-formed sentences that explain their content. The experimental results show that NetMe 2.0 can infer comprehensive and reliable biological networks with significant Precision-Recall metrics when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://netme.click/.",True,False,3.5,,,netme,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,NetMe,False,0.0,True,False,https://netme.click/,https://netme.click/,True,...pproaches.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://netme.click/.,1
35222846,SuPepMem: A database of innate immune system peptides and their cell membrane interactions.,"Host defense peptides (HDPs) are short cationic peptides that play a key role in the innate immune response of all living organisms. Their action mechanism does not depend on the presence of protein receptors, but on their ability to target and disrupt the membranes of a wide range of pathogenic and pathologic cells which are recognized by their specific compositions, typically with a relatively high concentration of anionic lipids. Lipid profile singularities have been found in cancer, inflammation, bacteria, viral infections, and even in senescent cells, enabling the possibility to use them as therapeutic targets and/or diagnostic biomarkers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are extraordinarily well suited to explore how HDPs interact with membrane models, providing a large amount of qualitative and quantitative information that, nowadays, cannot be assessed by wet-lab methods at the same level of temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we present SuPepMem, an open-access repository containing MD simulations of different natural and artificial peptides with potential membrane lysis activity, interacting with membrane models of healthy mammal, bacteria, viruses, cancer or senescent cells. In addition to a description of the HDPs and the target systems, SuPepMem provides both the input files necessary to run the simulations and also the results of some selected analyses, including structural and MD-based quantitative descriptors. These descriptors are expected to be useful to train machine learning algorithms that could contribute to design new therapeutic peptides. Tools for comparative analysis between different HDPs and model membranes, as well as to restrict the queries to structural and time-averaged properties are also available. SuPepMem is a living project, that will continuously grow with more simulations including peptides of different sequences, MD simulations with different number of peptide units, more membrane models and also several resolution levels. The database is open to MD simulations from other users (after quality check by the SuPepMem team).

38483315,PMechDB: A Public Database of Elementary Polar Reaction Steps.,"Most online chemical reaction databases are not publicly accessible or are fully downloadable. These databases tend to contain reactions in noncanonicalized formats and often lack comprehensive information regarding reaction pathways, intermediates, and byproducts. Within the few publicly available databases, reactions are typically stored in the form of unbalanced, overall transformations with minimal interpretability of the underlying chemistry. These limitations present significant obstacles to data-driven applications including the development of machine learning models. As an effort to overcome these challenges, we introduce PMechDB, a publicly accessible platform designed to curate, aggregate, and share polar chemical reaction data in the form of elementary reaction steps. Our initial version of PMechDB consists of over 100,000 such steps. In the PMechDB, all reactions are stored as canonicalized and balanced elementary steps, featuring accurate atom mapping and arrow-pushing mechanisms. As an online interactive database, PMechDB provides multiple interfaces that enable users to search, download, and upload chemical reactions. We anticipate that the public availability of PMechDB and its standardized data representation will prove beneficial for chemoinformatics research and education and the development of data-driven, interpretable models for predicting reactions and pathways.

Uncovering biomarkers that are unique to EOCRC is of great importance to facilitate the prevention and detection of this growing cancer subtype. Although efforts have been made in the data curation about CRC, there is no integrated platform that gives access to data specifically related to young CRC patients. Here, we constructed a user-friendly open integrated resource called CRCDB (URL: http://crcdb-hust.com) which contains multi-omics data of 785 EOCRC, 4898 late-onset CRCs (LOCRC), and 1110 normal control samples from tissue, whole blood, platelets, and serum exosomes. CRCDB manages the differential analysis, survival analysis, co-expression analysis, and immune cell infiltration comparison analysis results in different CRC groups. Meta-analysis results were also provided for users for further data interpretation. Using the resource in CRCDB, we identified that genes associated with the metabolic process were less expressed in EOCRC patients, while up regulated genes most associated with the mitosis process might play an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of LOCRC. Survival-related genes were most enriched in oxidoreduction pathways in EOCRC while in immune-related pathways in LOCRC. With all the data gathered and processed, we anticipate that CRCDB could be a practical data mining platform to help explore potential applications of omics data and develop effective prevention and therapeutic strategies for the specific group of CRC patients.",True,False,4.0,,,crcdb,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,CRCDB,True,6.0,True,True,http://crcdb-hust.com,http://crcdb-hust.com,True,"...endly open integrated resource called CRCDB (URL: http://crcdb-hust.com) which contains multi-omics data of 785 EOCRC, 48...",1
36304304,ChanFAD: A Functional Annotation Database for Ion Channels.,"Ion channels are integral membrane protein complexes critical for regulation of membrane potential, cell volume, and other signaling events. As complex molecular assemblies with many interacting partners, ion channels have multiple structural and functional domains. While channel sequence and functional data are readily available across multiple online resources, there is an unmet need for functional annotation directly relating primary sequence information, 2D interactions, and three-dimensional protein structure. To this end, we present ChanFAD (Channel Functional Annotation Database), to provide the research community with a centralized resource for ion channel structure and functional data. ChanFAD provides functional annotation of PDB structures built on the National Center for Biotechnology Information's iCn3D structure viewing tool while providing additional information such as primary sequence, organism, and relevant links to other databases.

40400345,3-D substructure search by transitive closure in AlphaFold database.,"Identifying structural relationships between proteins is crucial for understanding their functions and evolutionary histories. We present ISS_ProtSci, a Python package designed for structural similarity searches within the AlphaFold Database v2 (AFDB2). ISS_ProtSci incorporates DaliLite to identify geometrically similar structures and uses a transitive closure algorithm to iteratively explore neighboring shells of proteins. The precomputed all-against-all comparisons generated by Foldseek, chosen for its speed, are validated by DaliLite for precision. Search results are annotated with metadata from UniProtKB and Pfam protein family classifications, using hmmsearch to identify protein domains. Outputs, including Dali pairwise alignment data, are provided in TSV format for easy filtering and analysis. Our method offers a significant improvement in recall over existing tools like Foldseek, especially in detecting more distantly related proteins. This is particularly valuable in structurally diverse protein families where traditional sequence-based or fast structural methods struggle. ISS_ProtSci delivers practical runtimes and flexibility, allowing users to input a PDB file, define the minimum size of the common core, and evaluate results using Pfam clans. In evaluating our method across 12 test cases based on Pfam clans, we achieved over 99% recall of relevant proteins, even in challenging cases where Foldseek's recall dropped below 50%.

36370105,The STRING database in 2023: protein-protein association networks and functional enrichment analyses for any sequenced genome of interest.,"Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface.

Various microbes have been found to colonize cancer tissues and play important roles in cancer diagnoses and outcomes, with many studies focusing on developing better cancer-related microbiome data. However, there are currently no independent, comprehensive open resources cataloguing cancer-related microbiome data, which limits the exploration of the relationship between these microbes and cancer progression. Given this, we propose a new strategy to re-align the existing next-generation sequencing data to facilitate the mining of hidden sequence data describing the microbiome to maximize available resources. To this end, we collected 417 publicly available datasets from 25 human and 14 mouse tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and use these to develop a novel pipeline to re-align microbiome sequences facilitating in-depth analyses designed to reveal the microbial profile of various cancer tissues and their healthy controls. microbioTA is a user-friendly online platform which allows users to browse, search, visualize, and download microbial abundance data from various tissues along with corresponding analysis results, aimimg at providing a reference for cancer-related microbiome research.",True,False,3.0,,microbiota,,16.0,ok,,gene expression omnibus,,spacy,0.0,microbioTA,False,0.0,True,False,http://bio-annotation.cn/microbiota,http://bio-annotation.cn/microbiota,True,"microbioTA (http://bio-annotation.cn/microbiota) was constructed to provide a comprehensive, user...",1
36402891,GediNET for discovering gene associations across diseases using knowledge based machine learning approach.,"The most common approaches to discovering genes associated with specific diseases are based on machine learning and use a variety of feature selection techniques to identify significant genes that can serve as biomarkers for a given disease. More recently, the integration in this process of prior knowledge-based approaches has shown significant promise in the discovery of new biomarkers with potential translational applications. In this study, we developed a novel approach, GediNET, that integrates prior biological knowledge to gene Groups that are shown to be associated with a specific disease such as a cancer. The novelty of GediNET is that it then also allows the discovery of significant associations between that specific disease and other diseases. The initial step in this process involves the identification of gene Groups. The Groups are then subjected to a Scoring component to identify the top performing classification Groups. The top-ranked gene Groups are then used to train a Machine Learning Model. The process of Grouping, Scoring and Modelling (G-S-M) is used by GediNET to identify other diseases that are similarly associated with this signature. GediNET identifies these relationships through Disease-Disease Association (DDA) based machine learning. DDA explores novel associations between diseases and identifies relationships which could be used to further improve approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

These constituents communicate with one another to induce changes in the host's mood, cognition and demeanor. Knowledge concerning the regulation of the host central nervous system by gut microbiota is fragmented and mostly confined to disorganized or semi-structured unrestricted texts. Such a format hinders the exploration and comprehension of unknown territories or the further advancement of artificial intelligence systems. Hence, we collated crucial information by scrutinizing an extensive body of literature, amalgamated the extant knowledge of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and depicted it in the form of a knowledge graph named MMiKG, which can be visualized on the GraphXR platform and the Neo4j database, correspondingly. By merging various associated resources and deducing prospective connections between gut microbiota and the central nervous system through MMiKG, users can acquire a more comprehensive perception of the pathogenesis of mental disorders and generate novel insights for advancing therapeutic measures.

37730114,HPC-Atlas: Computationally Constructing A Comprehensive Atlas of Human Protein Complexes.,"A fundamental principle of biology is that proteins tend to form complexes to play important roles in the core functions of cells. For a complete understanding of human cellular functions, it is crucial to have a comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes. Unfortunately, we still lack such a comprehensive atlas of experimentally validated protein complexes, which prevents us from gaining a complete understanding of the compositions and functions of human protein complexes, as well as the underlying biological mechanisms. To fill this gap, we built Human Protein Complexes Atlas (HPC-Atlas), as far as we know, the most accurate and comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes available to date. We integrated two latest protein interaction networks, and developed a novel computational method to identify nearly 9000 protein complexes, including many previously uncharacterized complexes. Compared with the existing methods, our method achieved outstanding performance on both testing and independent datasets. Furthermore, with HPC-Atlas we identified 751 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-affected human protein complexes, and 456 multifunctional proteins that contain many potential moonlighting proteins. These results suggest that HPC-Atlas can serve as not only a computing framework to effectively identify biologically meaningful protein complexes by integrating multiple protein data sources, but also a valuable resource for exploring new biological findings.

This study introduces FLIBase (www.FLIBase.org), a specialized database that focuses on annotating full-length isoforms using long-read sequencing techniques. We collected and integrated long-read (351 samples) and short-read (12 469 samples) RNA sequencing data from diverse normal and cancerous human tissues and cells. The current version of FLIBase comprises a total of 983 789 full-length spliced isoforms, identified through long-read sequences and verified using short-read exon-exon splice junctions. Of these, 188 248 isoforms have been annotated, while 795 541 isoforms remain unannotated. By overcoming the limitations of short-read RNA sequencing methods, FLIBase provides an accurate and comprehensive representation of full-length transcripts. These comprehensive annotations empower researchers to undertake various downstream analyses and investigations. Importantly, FLIBase exhibits a significant advantage in identifying a substantial number of previously unannotated isoforms and tumor-specific RNA transcripts. These tumor-specific RNA transcripts have the potential to serve as a source of immunogenic recurrent neoantigens.

37468182,D-ORB: A Web Server to Extract Structural Features of Related But Unaligned RNA Sequences.,"Identifying the common structural elements of functionally related RNA sequences (family) is usually based on an alignment of the sequences, which is often subject to human bias and may not be accurate. The resulting covariance model (CM) provides probabilities for each base to covary with another, which allows to support evolutionarily the formation of double helical regions and possibly pseudoknots. The coexistence of alternative folds in RNA, resulting from its dynamic nature, may lead to the potential omission of motifs by CM. To overcome this limitation, we present D-ORB, a system of algorithms that identifies overrepresented motifs in the secondary conformational landscapes of a family when compared to those of unrelated sequences. The algorithms are bundled into an easy-to-use website allowing users to submit a family, and optionally provide unrelated sequences. D-ORB produces a non-pseudoknotted secondary structure based on the overrepresented motifs, a deep neural network classifier and two decision trees. When used to model an Rfam family, D-ORB fits overrepresented motifs in the corresponding Rfam structure; more than a hundred Rfam families have been modeled. The statistical approach behind D-ORB derives the structural composition of an RNA family, making it a valuable tool for analyzing and modeling it.

36747479,SalivaDB-a comprehensive database for salivary biomarkers in humans.,"Saliva as a non-invasive diagnostic fluid has immense potential as a tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of patients. The information about salivary biomarkers is broadly scattered across various resources and research papers. It is important to bring together all the information on salivary biomarkers to a single platform. This will accelerate research and development in non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of complex diseases. We collected widespread information on five types of salivary biomarkers-proteins, metabolites, microbes, micro-ribonucleic acid (miRNA) and genes found in humans. This information was collected from different resources that include PubMed, the Human Metabolome Database and SalivaTecDB. Our database SalivaDB contains a total of 15 821 entries for 201 different diseases and 48 disease categories. These entries can be classified into five categories based on the type of biomolecules; 6067, 3987, 2909, 2272 and 586 entries belong to proteins, metabolites, microbes, miRNAs and genes, respectively. The information maintained in this database includes analysis methods, associated diseases, biomarker type, regulation status, exosomal origin, fold change and sequence. The entries are linked to relevant biological databases to provide users with comprehensive information. We developed a web-based interface that provides a wide range of options like browse, keyword search and advanced search. In addition, a similarity search module has been integrated which allows users to perform a similarity search using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and Smith-Waterman algorithm against biomarker sequences in SalivaDB.

Prominently, CBP60g and SARD1 are paralogous CBP60 transcription factors that regulate numerous components of the immune system, such as cell surface and intracellular immune receptors, MAP kinases, WRKY transcription factors, and biosynthetic enzymes for immunity-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and <i>N</i>-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). However, their function, regulation, and diversification in most species remain unclear. Here, we have created CBP60-DB (https://cbp60db.wlu.ca/), a structural and bioinformatic database that comprehensively characterized 1052 <i>CBP60</i> gene homologs (encoding 2376 unique transcripts and 1996 unique proteins) across 62 phylogenetically diverse genomes in the plant kingdom. We have employed deep learning-predicted structural analyses using AlphaFold2 and then generated dedicated web pages for all plant CBP60 proteins. Importantly, we have generated a novel clustering visualization algorithm to interrogate kingdom-wide structural similarities for more efficient inference of conserved functions across various plant taxa. Because well-characterized CBP60 proteins in Arabidopsis are known to be transcription factors with putative calmodulin-binding domains, we have integrated external bioinformatic resources to analyze protein domains and motifs.

The sporadic spread of the disease outbreaks has resulted in the need for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease infection and potential therapeutic targets. Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in various cellular processes and regulate different immune signals during virus infection. Computational algorithms have gained high significance in the prediction of potential protein interaction pairs. Here, we developed a comprehensive database called HuPoxNET (https://kaabil.net/hupoxnet/) using the state-of-the-art MERN stack technology. The database leverages two sequence-based computational models to predict strain-specific protein-protein interactions between human and monkeypox virus proteins.

39205165,VOGDB-Database of Virus Orthologous Groups.,"Computational models of homologous protein groups are essential in sequence bioinformatics. Due to the diversity and rapid evolution of viruses, the grouping of protein sequences from virus genomes is particularly challenging. The low sequence similarities of homologous genes in viruses require specific approaches for sequence- and structure-based clustering. Furthermore, the annotation of virus genomes in public databases is not as consistent and up to date as for many cellular genomes. To tackle these problems, we have developed VOGDB, which is a database of virus orthologous groups. VOGDB is a multi-layer database that progressively groups viral genes into groups connected by increasingly remote similarity. The first layer is based on pair-wise sequence similarities, the second layer is based on the sequence profile alignments, and the third layer uses predicted protein structures to find the most remote similarity. VOGDB groups allow for more sensitive homology searches of novel genes and increase the chance of predicting annotations or inferring phylogeny. VOGD B uses all virus genomes from RefSeq and partially reannotates them. VOGDB is updated with every RefSeq release. The unique feature of VOGDB is the inclusion of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses in the same clustering process, which makes it possible to explore old evolutionary relationships of the two groups.

35567946,PmiRtarbase: A positive miRNA-target regulations database.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nt small non-coding RNA segments that are widely involved in the regulation of gene expression. Accumulating evidences show that miRNAs not only inhibit the expression of some targeted genes but also promote that of some targeted genes in specific conditions. Over the past decades, many miRNA-target databases have been developed from computational prediction and/or experimental validation perspectives. However, there is no database available to systematically collect positive miRNA-target associations that are essential in deciphering the miRNA regulation mechanism. To promote the miRNA study, we developed a new database: PmiRtarbase that acquires validated positive miRNA-target interactions by mining published literature. It includes 312 curated associations between 119 miRNAs and 169 genes in 8 species from 130 studies and summarizes the conditions and detailed descriptions of the miRNA-target associations. We also constructed a database named PmiRtarbase, a user-friendly interface to conveniently search and download all related entries.

37599593,PolyQ Database-an integrated database on polyglutamine diseases.,"Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormally expanded Cytosine, Adenine, Guanine (CAG) triplet repeat sequences in the coding region of otherwise unrelated genes. Until now, nine different polyQ diseases have been described: Huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and six types of spinocerebellar ataxias-1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17. The pathogenic expansion translates into an aberrant tract of glutamines in the encoded proteins, compromising several cellular functions and biological processes. There is currently no cure available for the progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by the ensuing cytotoxic alterations. Although each disease is considered rare, polyQ diseases constitute the largest group of monogenic neurodegenerative disorders. Information about these disorders is scattered among several books, articles and general databases, hindering exploration by students and researchers, but also by patients and their families. Therefore, we aimed to develop a free online database to fill this gap, by centralizing relevant available information. The PolyQ Database is a platform that focuses on all nine polyQ diseases and offers information about topics that are pertinent for scientists, clinicians and the general public, including epidemiology, the characteristics of the causative genes and the codified proteins, the pathophysiology of the diseases and the main clinical manifestations.

A thorough understanding of hematopoiesis in vivo and facilitation of generating functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro necessitate a comprehensive hematopoietic cross-stage developmental landscape across species. To address this need, we developed HemAtlas, a platform designed for the systematic mapping of hematopoiesis both in vivo and in vitro. HemAtlas features detailed analyses of multi-omics datasets from humans, mice, zebrafish, and HSPC in vitro culture systems. Utilizing literature curation and data normalization, HemAtlas integrates various functional modules, allowing interactive exploration and visualization of any collected omics data based on user-specific interests. Moreover, by applying a systematic and uniform integration method, we constructed organ-wide hematopoietic references for each species with manually curated cell annotations, enabling a comprehensive decoding of cross-stage developmental hematopoiesis at the organ level. Of particular significance are three distinctive functions - single-cell cross-stage, cross-species, and cross-model analyses - that HemAtlas employs to elucidate the hematopoietic development in zebrafish, mice, and humans, and to offer guidance on the generation of HSPCs in vitro. Simultaneously, HemAtlas incorporates a comprehensive map of HSPC cross-stage development to reveal HSPC stage-specific properties.

The specificity of allelic variants to different human populations can, however, be a rich source of information when studying the genetic basis of population-specific immune responses in disease and in vaccination. Therefore, we meticulously identified true germline alleles enriched with complete TR allele sequences and their frequencies across 26 different human populations, profiled by ""1000 Genomes data"". We identified 205 TRAV, 249 TRBV, 16 TRGV and 5 TRDV germline alleles supported by at least four haplotypes. The diversity of germline allelic variants in the TR loci is the highest in Africans, while the majority of the Non-African alleles are specific to the Asian populations, suggesting a diverse profile of TR germline alleles in different human populations.

Immunotherapy has changed the treatment landscape for a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. To assist researchers in efficiently uncovering valuable information related to cancer immunotherapy, we have presented a manually curated comprehensive database called DIRMC, which focuses on molecular features involved in cancer immunotherapy. All the content was collected manually from published literature, authoritative clinical trial data submitted by clinicians, some databases for drug target prediction such as DrugBank, and some experimentally confirmed high-throughput data sets for the characterization of immune-related molecular interactions in cancer, such as a curated database of T-cell receptor sequences with known antigen specificity (VDJdb), a pathology-associated TCR database (McPAS-TCR) et al. By constructing a fully connected functional network, ranging from cancer-related gene mutations to target genes to translated target proteins to protein regions or sites that may specifically affect protein function, we aim to comprehensively characterize molecular features related to cancer immunotherapy. We have developed the scoring criteria to assess the reliability of each MHC-peptide-T-cell receptor (TCR) interaction item to provide a reference for users. The database provides a user-friendly interface to browse and retrieve data by genes, target proteins, diseases and more. DIRMC also provides a download and submission page for researchers to access data of interest for further investigation or submit new interactions related to cancer immunotherapy targets. Furthermore, DIRMC provides a graphical interface to help users predict the binding affinity between their own peptide of interest and MHC or TCR.

CysModDB contains five parts: (1) 70 536 experimentally verified CysPTM sites with annotations of sample origin and enrichment techniques, (2) 21 654 modified proteins annotated with functional regions and structure information, (3) cross-references to external databases such as the protein-protein interactions database, (4) online computational tools for predicting CysPTM sites and (5) integrated analysis tools such as gene enrichment and investigation of sequence features. These parts are integrated using a customized graphic browser and a Basket. The browser uses graphs to represent the distribution of modified sites with different CysPTM types on protein sequences and mapping these sites to the protein structures and functional regions, which assists in exploring cross-talks between the modified sites and their potential effect on protein functions. The Basket connects proteins and CysPTM sites to the analysis tools.

35306049,miRNAFinder: A comprehensive web resource for plant Pre-microRNA classification.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are known as one of the small non-coding RNA molecules that control the expression of genes at the RNA level, while some operate at the DNA level. They typically range from 20 to 24 nucleotides in length and can be found in the plant and animal kingdoms as well as in some viruses. Computational approaches have overcome the limitations of the experimental methods and have performed well in identifying miRNAs. Compared to mature miRNAs, precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are long and have a hairpin loop structure with structural features. Therefore, most in-silico tools are implemented for pre-miRNA identification. This study presents a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based classifier implemented using 180 features under sequential, structural, and thermodynamic feature categories for plant pre-miRNA identification. This classifier has a 92% accuracy, a 94% specificity, and a 90% sensitivity. We have further tested this model with other small non-coding RNA types and obtained 78% accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a novel dataset to train and test machine learning models, addressing the overlapping data issue in the positive training and testing datasets presented in PlantMiRNAPred for the classification of real and pseudo-plant pre-miRNAs. The new dataset and the classifier that can be used with any plant species are deployed on a web server freely accessible at http://mirnafinder.shyaman.me/.",True,False,4.5,,mirnafinder,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,miRNAFinder,True,3.0,True,True,http://mirnafinder.shyaman.me/,http://mirnafinder.shyaman.me/,True,...are deployed on a web server freely accessible at http://mirnafinder.shyaman.me/.,1
36420165,RNAME: A comprehensive database of RNA modification enzymes.,"The dynamic RNA modifications were orchestrated by a series of enzymes, namely ""writer"", ""reader"" and ""eraser"", which can install, recognize and remove the modifications, respectively. However, only a very small number of experimentally validated RNA modification enzymes have been identified and reported. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a database to deposit RNA modification enzymes. In the present work, we developed the RNAME database (https://chenweilab.cn/rname/) to provide a comprehensive resource for RNA modification enzymes. The current version of RNAME deposits more than 21,000 manually curated RNA modification enzymes, which are from 456 species and covers the 7 common kinds of RNA modifications (i.e., adenosine to inosine, N<sup>1</sup>-methyladenosine, N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytidine, N<sup>7</sup>-methylguanosine, mRNA cap modification, and pseudouridine).

38632050,"GAUSS: a summary-statistics-based R package for accurate estimation of linkage disequilibrium for variants, Gaussian imputation, and TWAS analysis of cosmopolitan cohorts.","<h4>Motivation</h4>As the availability of larger and more ethnically diverse reference panels grows, there is an increase in demand for ancestry-informed imputation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other downstream analyses, e.g. fine-mapping. Performing such analyses at the genotype level is computationally challenging and necessitates, at best, a laborious process to access individual-level genotype and phenotype data. Summary-statistics-based tools, not requiring individual-level data, provide an efficient alternative that streamlines computational requirements and promotes open science by simplifying the re-analysis and downstream analysis of existing GWAS summary data. However, existing tools perform only disparate parts of needed analysis, have only command-line interfaces, and are difficult to extend/link by applied researchers.<h4>Results</h4>To address these challenges, we present Genome Analysis Using Summary Statistics (GAUSS)-a comprehensive and user-friendly R package designed to facilitate the re-analysis/downstream analysis of GWAS summary statistics. GAUSS offers an integrated toolkit for a range of functionalities, including (i) estimating ancestry proportion of study cohorts, (ii) calculating ancestry-informed linkage disequilibrium, (iii) imputing summary statistics of unobserved variants, (iv) conducting transcriptome-wide association studies, and (v) correcting for ""Winner's Curse"" biases. Notably, GAUSS utilizes an expansive, multi-ethnic reference panel consisting of 32 953 genomes from 29 ethnic groups. This panel enhances the range and accuracy of imputable variants, including the ability to impute summary statistics of rarer variants. As a result, GAUSS elevates the quality and applicability of existing GWAS analyses without requiring access to subject-level genotypic and phenotypic information.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The GAUSS R package, complete with its source code, is readily accessible to the public via our GitHub repository at https://github.com/statsleelab/gauss.

36043442,ipaQTL-atlas: an atlas of intronic polyadenylation quantitative trait loci across human tissues.,"Functional interpretation of disease-associated non-coding variants remains a significant challenge in the post-GWAS era. Our recent study has identified 3'UTR alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3'aQTLs) and connects APA events with QTLs as a major driver of human traits and diseases. Besides 3'UTR, APA events can also occur in intron regions, and increasing evidence has connected intronic polyadenylation with disease risk. However, systematic investigation of the roles of intronic polyadenylation in human diseases remained challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive database across a variety of human tissues. Here, we developed ipaQTL-atlas (http://bioinfo.szbl.ac.cn/ipaQTL) as the first comprehensive portal for intronic polyadenylation. The ipaQTL-atlas is based on the analysis of 15 170 RNA-seq data from 838 individuals across 49 Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v8) tissues and contains ∼0.98 million SNPs associated with intronic APA events.

Proteins are phosphorylated by kinases, which have been studied as drug targets for the treatment of various diseases, particularly cancer. Because kinases have multiple roles in interconnected molecular pathways, their specific regulation is required to enhance beneficial and reduce adversarial effects of drugs. Using our previously developed platform, we measured phosphorylation profiles of MCF7 and K562 cells treated with 94 clinical drugs. These phosphorylation profiles can provide insights into pathway activities and biological functions. Here, we introduce Phosprof, a novel database of drug response based on phosphorylation activity. Phosprof is able to present up- or downregulated phosphorylated signature proteins on pathway maps, significant pathways on the hierarchal tree in signal transduction and commonly perturbed pathways affected by the selected drugs. It also serves as a useful web interface for new or known drug profile search based on their molecular similarity with the 94 drugs.

We therefore developed CHDbase, an evidence-based knowledgebase of CHD-related genes and clinical manifestations manually curated from 1114 publications, linking 1124susceptibility genes and 3591 variations to more than 300 CHD types and related syndromes. Metadata such as the information of each publication and the selected population and samples, the strategy of studies, and the major findings of studies were integrated with each item of the research record. We also integrated functional annotations through parsing ∼ 50 databases/tools to facilitate the interpretation of these genes and variations in disease pathogenicity. We further prioritized the significance of these CHD-related genes with a gene interaction network approach and extracted a core CHD sub-network with 163 genes. The clear genetic landscape of CHD enables the phenotype classification based on the shared genetic origin.

37223317,TRIPBASE: a database for identifying the human genomic DNA and lncRNA triplexes.,"Long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA sequences which are >200 nt with no coding capacity. These lncRNAs participate in various biological mechanisms, and are widely abundant in a diversity of species. There is well-documented evidence that lncRNAs can interact with genomic DNAs by forming triple helices (triplexes). Previously, several computational methods have been designed based on the Hoogsteen base-pair rule to find theoretical RNA-DNA:DNA triplexes. While powerful, these methods suffer from a high false-positive rate between the predicted triplexes and the biological experiments. To address this issue, we first collected the experimental data of genomic RNA-DNA triplexes from antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated capture assays and used Triplexator, the most widely used tool for lncRNA-DNA interaction, to reveal the intrinsic information on true triplex binding potential. Based on the analysis, we proposed six computational attributes as filters to improve the <i>in-silico</i> triplex prediction by removing most false positives. Further, we have built a new database, TRIPBASE, as the first comprehensive collection of genome-wide triplex predictions of human lncRNAs.

These AOPs describe mechanistic information about toxicodynamic processes and can be used to develop effective risk assessment strategies. However, it is challenging to automatically and systematically parse, filter, and use its contents. We explored solutions to better structure the AOP-Wiki content, and to link it with chemical and biological resources. Together, this allows more detailed exploration, which can be automated.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We converted the complete AOP-Wiki content into resource description framework (RDF) triples. We used >20 ontologies for the semantic annotation of property-object relations, including the Chemical Information Ontology, Dublin Core, and the AOP Ontology.<h4>Results</h4>The resulting RDF contains >122,000 triples describing 158 unique properties of >15,000 unique subjects.

37649366,SUBTLEX-CY: A new word frequency database for Welsh.,"We present SUBTLEX-CY, a new word frequency database created from a 32-million-word corpus of Welsh television subtitles. An experiment comprising a lexical decision task examined SUBTLEX-CY frequency estimates against words with inconsistent frequencies in a much smaller Welsh corpus that is often used by researchers, the <i>Cronfa Electroneg o'r Gymraeg</i> (CEG), and three other Welsh word frequency databases. Words were selected that were classified as low frequency (LF) in SUBTLEX-CY and high frequency (HF) in CEG and compared with words that were classified as medium frequency (MF) in both SUBTLEX-CY and CEG. Reaction time analyses showed that HF words in CEG were responded to more slowly compared to MF words, suggesting that SUBTLEX-CY corpus provides a more reliable estimate of Welsh word frequencies.

39386138,An open-access database of video stimuli for action observation research in neuroimaging settings: psychometric evaluation and motion characterization.,"Video presentation has become ubiquitous in paradigms investigating the neural and behavioral responses to observed actions. In spite of the great interest in uncovering the processing of observed bodily movements and actions in neuroscience and cognitive science, at present, no standardized set of video stimuli for action observation research in neuroimaging settings exists. To facilitate future action observation research, we developed an open-access database of 135 high-definition videos of a male actor performing object-oriented actions. Actions from 3 categories: kinematically natural and goal-intact (<i>Normal</i>), kinematically unnatural and goal-intact (<i>How</i>), or kinematically natural and goal-violating (<i>What</i>), directed toward 15 different objects were filmed from 3 angles. Psychometric evaluation of the database revealed high video recognition accuracy (<i>Mean</i> accuracy = 88.61 %) and substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' <i>Kappa</i> = 0.702), establishing excellent validity and reliability. Videos' exact timing of motion onset was identified using a custom motion detection frame-differencing procedure. Based on its outcome, the videos were edited to assure that motion begins at the second frame of each video. The videos' timing of category recognition was also identified using a novel behavioral up-down staircase procedure. The identified timings can be incorporated in future experimental designs to counteract jittered stimulus onsets, thus vastly improving the sensitivity of neuroimaging experiments. All videos, their psychometric evaluations, and the timing of their frame of category recognition, as well as our custom programs for performing these evaluations on our, or on other similar video databases, are available at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zexc4/).",True,False,4.5,,an open,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,open-access database of video stimuli for action observation research in neuroimaging settings,True,5.0,False,False,https://osf.io/zexc4/,https://osf.io/zexc4/,True,"...ses, are available at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zexc4/).",1

The majority of emerging infectious disease outbreaks are caused by zoonotic/vector-borne viruses. Bats and rodents are the two most important reservoir hosts of many zoonotic viruses that can cross species barriers to infect humans, whereas mosquitos and ticks are well-established major vectors of many arboviral diseases. Moreover, some emerging zoonotic diseases require a vector to spread or are intrinsically vector-borne and zoonotically transmitted. In this study, we present a newly upgraded database of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses designated ZOVER (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ZOVER). It incorporates two previously released databases, DBatVir and DRodVir, for bat- and rodent-associated viruses, respectively, and further collects up-to-date knowledge on mosquito- and tick-associated viruses to establish a comprehensive online resource for zoonotic and vector-borne viruses. Additionally, it integrates a set of online visualization tools for convenient comparative analyses to facilitate the discovery of potential patterns of virome diversity and ecological characteristics between/within different viral hosts/vectors.

Despite the continuous information accumulation of clinically significant DDIs, there are few open-access knowledge systems dedicated to the curation of DDI associations. To facilitate the clinicians to screen for dangerous drug combinations and improve health systems, we present DDInter, a curated DDI database with comprehensive data, practical medication guidance, intuitive function interface, and powerful visualization to the scientific community. Currently, DDInter contains about 0.24M DDI associations connecting 1833 approved drugs (1972 entities). Each drug is annotated with basic chemical and pharmacological information and its interaction network. For DDI associations, abundant and professional annotations are provided, including severity, mechanism description, strategies for managing potential side effects, alternative medications, etc. The drug entities and interaction entities are efficiently cross-linked. In addition to basic query and browsing, the prescription checking function is developed to facilitate clinicians to decide whether drugs combinations can be used safely. It can also be used for informatics-based DDI investigation and evaluation of other prediction frameworks.

34634807,VThunter: a database for single-cell screening of virus target cells in the animal kingdom.,"Viral infectious diseases are a devastating and continuing threat to human and animal health. Receptor binding is the key step for viral entry into host cells. Therefore, recognizing viral receptors is fundamental for understanding the potential tissue tropism or host range of these pathogens. The rapid advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has paved the way for studying the expression of viral receptors in different tissues of animal species at single-cell resolution, resulting in huge scRNA-seq datasets. However, effectively integrating or sharing these datasets among the research community is challenging, especially for laboratory scientists. In this study, we manually curated up-to-date datasets generated in animal scRNA-seq studies, analyzed them using a unified processing pipeline, and comprehensively annotated 107 viral receptors in 142 viruses and obtained accurate expression signatures in 2 100 962 cells from 47 animal species.

This accumulation during development and aging has been implicated as a causal factor in aging and age-related pathology, including but not limited to cancer. Due to their generally very low abundance mutations have been difficult to detect in normal tissues. Only with recent advances in DNA sequencing of single-cells, clonal lineages or ultra-high-depth sequencing of small tissue biopsies, somatic mutation frequencies and spectra have been unveiled in several tissue types. The rapid accumulation of such data prompted us to develop a platform called SomaMutDB (https://vijglab.einsteinmed.org/SomaMutDB) to catalog the 2.42 million single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 0.12 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs) thus far identified using these advanced methods in nineteen human tissues or cell types as a function of age or environmental stress conditions. SomaMutDB employs a user-friendly interface to display and query somatic mutations with their functional annotations.

COVID-19, an epidemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been found to be accompanied with multiple-organ failure since its first report in Dec 2019. To reveal tissue-specific molecular characteristics, researches regarding to COVID-19 have been carried out widely, especially at single-cell resolution. However, these researches are still relatively independent and scattered, limiting the comprehensive understanding of the impact of virus on diverse tissues. To this end, we developed a single-cell atlas of COVID-19. Firstly we collected 21 single-cell datasets of COVID-19 across 10 human tissues paired with control datasets. Then we constructed a pipeline for the analysis of these datasets to reveal molecular characteristics of COVID-19 based on manually annotated cell types.

Liquid chromatography is a technique commonly used for protein purification, where the separation is performed by exploiting the differences in physical and chemical characteristics of proteins. The complex nature of proteins requires researchers to carefully choose buffers that maintain stability and activity of the protein while also allowing for appropriate interaction with chromatography columns. To choose the proper buffer, biochemists often search for reports of successful purification in the literature; however, they often encounter roadblocks such as lack of accessibility to journals, non-exhaustive specification of components and unfamiliar naming conventions. To overcome such issues, we present PurificationDB (https://purificationdatabase.herokuapp.com/), an open-access and user-friendly knowledge base that contains 4732 curated and standardized entries of protein purification conditions. Buffer specifications were derived from the literature using named-entity recognition techniques developed using common nomenclature provided by protein biochemists.

Although database resources for ecDNA are now available, a sophisticated web application dedicated to ecDNA gene analysis remains absent. Therefore, we developed ecDNA gene analyzer (ECGA). ECGA catalogues 23,274 unique ecDNA genes of 27 cancers across 27 tissues. ECGA also offers five specialized analysis tools: (1) 'Venn analysis' looks for overlaps between a given gene list and ecDNA genes; (2) 'Enrichment analysis' performs over-representation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis of input gene list within predefined ecDNA gene sets; (3) 'Target discovery' identifies upregulated ecDNA genes as targets by comparing with reference expression in normal samples; (4) 'DE analysis' finds differentially expressed ecDNA genes; (5) 'Signature discovery' discerns ecDNA gene signatures capable of classifying samples into phenotypic groups, and it is accompanied by 'Signature validation' for model test on unseen data.

38747369,ProkDBP: Toward more precise identification of prokaryotic DNA binding proteins.,"Prokaryotic DNA binding proteins (DBPs) play pivotal roles in governing gene regulation, DNA replication, and various cellular functions. Accurate computational models for predicting prokaryotic DBPs hold immense promise in accelerating the discovery of novel proteins, fostering a deeper understanding of prokaryotic biology, and facilitating the development of therapeutics targeting for potential disease interventions. However, existing generic prediction models often exhibit lower accuracy in predicting prokaryotic DBPs. To address this gap, we introduce ProkDBP, a novel machine learning-driven computational model for prediction of prokaryotic DBPs. For prediction, a total of nine shallow learning algorithms and five deep learning models were utilized, with the shallow learning models demonstrating higher performance metrics compared to their deep learning counterparts. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), coupled with evolutionarily significant features selected via random forest variable importance measure (RF-VIM) yielded the highest five-fold cross-validation accuracy. The model achieved the highest auROC (0.9534) and auPRC (0.9575) among the 14 machine learning models evaluated. Additionally, ProkDBP demonstrated substantial performance with an independent dataset, exhibiting higher values of auROC (0.9332) and auPRC (0.9371). Notably, when benchmarked against several cutting-edge existing models, ProkDBP showcased superior predictive accuracy.

Highly sensitive enabling technologies, including microarray- and sequencing-based approaches have allowed genome-wide profiling of cytosine modifications in DNAs in clinical samples to facilitate discovery of epigenetic biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Historically, many previous studies, however, did not distinguish the most investigated 5-methylcytosines (5mC) from other modified cytosines, especially the biochemically stable 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), which have been shown to have a distinct genomic distribution and regulatory role from 5mC. Notably, during the past several years, the 5hmC-Seal, a highly sensitive chemical labeling technique, has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in clinically feasible biospecimens (e.g. a few milliliter of plasma or serum). The 5hmC-Seal technique has been utilized by our team in biomarker discovery for human cancers and other complex diseases using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as well as the characterization of the first 5hmC Human Tissue Map. Convenient access to the accumulating 5hmC-Seal data will allow the research community to validate and re-use these results, potentially providing novel insights into epigenetic contribution to a range of human diseases. Here we introduce the PETCH-DB, an integrated database that was implemented to provide 5hmC-related results generated using the 5hmC-Seal technique.

37207351,Developing TeroENZ and TeroMAP modules for the terpenome research platform TeroKit.,"Terpenoids and their derivatives are collectively known as the terpenome and are the largest class of natural products, whose biosynthesis refers to various kinds of enzymes. To date, there is no terpenome-related enzyme database, which is a desire for enzyme mining, metabolic engineering and discovery of new natural products related to terpenoids. In this work, we have constructed a comprehensive database called TeroENZ (http://terokit.qmclab.com/browse_enz.html) containing 13 462 enzymes involved in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, covering 2541 species and 4293 reactions reported in the literature and public databases. At the same time, we classify enzymes according to their catalytic reactions into cyclase, oxidoreductase, transferase, and so on, and also make a classification according to species. This meticulous classification is beneficial for users as it can be retrieved and downloaded conveniently. We also provide a computational module for isozyme prediction. Moreover, a module named TeroMAP (http://terokit.qmclab.com/browse_rxn.html) is also constructed to organize all available terpenoid enzymatic reactions into an interactive network by interfacing with the previously established database of terpenoid compounds, TeroMOL. Finally, all these databases and modules are integrated into the web server TeroKit (http://terokit.qmclab.com/) to shed light on the field of terpenoid research.

35061087,NucPosDB: a database of nucleosome positioning in vivo and nucleosomics of cell-free DNA.,"Nucleosome positioning is involved in many gene regulatory processes happening in the cell, and it may change as cells differentiate or respond to the changing microenvironment in a healthy or diseased organism. One important implication of nucleosome positioning in clinical epigenetics is its use in the ""nucleosomics"" analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for the purpose of patient diagnostics in liquid biopsies. The rationale for this is that the apoptotic nucleases that digest chromatin of the dying cells mostly cut DNA between nucleosomes. Thus, the short pieces of DNA in body fluids reflect the positions of nucleosomes in the cells of origin. Here, we report a systematic nucleosomics database - NucPosDB - curating published nucleosome positioning datasets in vivo as well as datasets of sequenced cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that reflect nucleosome positioning in situ in the cells of origin. Users can select subsets of the database by a number of criteria and then obtain raw or processed data. NucPosDB also reports the originally determined regions with stable nucleosome occupancy across several individuals with a given condition. An additional section provides a catalogue of computational tools for the analysis of nucleosome positioning or cfDNA experiments and theoretical algorithms for the prediction of nucleosome positioning preferences from DNA sequence. We provide an overview of the field, describe the structure of the database in this context, and demonstrate data variability using examples of different medical conditions. NucPosDB is useful both for the analysis of fundamental gene regulation processes and the training of computational models for patient diagnostics based on cfDNA. The database currently curates ~ 400 publications on nucleosome positioning in cell lines and in situ as well as cfDNA from > 10,000 patients and healthy volunteers. For open-access cfDNA datasets as well as key MNase-seq datasets in human cells, NucPosDB allows downloading processed mapped data in addition to the regions with stable nucleosome occupancy.

In this study, we constructed a new platform (iORbase, https://www.iorbase.com) for the structural and functional analysis of iORs based on a combined algorithm for gene annotation and protein structure prediction. Moreover, it provides the option to calculate the binding affinities and binding residues between iORs and pheromone molecules by virtual screening of docking. Furthermore, iORbase supports the automatic structural and functional prediction of user-submitted iORs or pheromones. iORbase contains the well-analyzed results of approximately 6 000 iORs and their 3D protein structures identified from 59 insect species and 2 077 insect pheromones from the literature, as well as approximately 12 million pairs of simulated interactions between functional iORs and pheromones. We also built 4 online modules, iORPDB, iInteraction, iModelTM, and iOdorTool to easily retrieve and visualize the 3D structures and interactions. iORbase can help greatly improve the experimental efficiency and success rate, identify new insecticide targets, or develop electronic nose technology.

40254830,TaxSEA: rapid interpretation of microbiome alterations using taxon set enrichment analysis and public databases.,"Microbial communities are essential regulators of ecosystem function, with their composition commonly assessed through DNA sequencing. Most current tools focus on detecting changes among individual taxa (e.g. species or genera), however in other omics fields, such as transcriptomics, enrichment analyses like gene set enrichment analysis are commonly used to uncover patterns not seen with individual features. Here, we introduce TaxSEA, a taxon set enrichment analysis tool available as an R package, a web portal (https://shiny.taxsea.app), and a Python package. TaxSEA integrates taxon sets from five public microbiota databases (BugSigDB, MiMeDB, GutMGene, mBodyMap, and GMRepoV2) while also allowing users to incorporate custom sets such as taxonomic groupings. In silico assessments show TaxSEA is accurate across a range of set sizes. When applied to differential abundance analysis output from inflammatory bowel disease and type 2 diabetes metagenomic data, TaxSEA can rapidly identify changes in functional groups corresponding to known associations. We also show that TaxSEA is robust to the choice of differential abundance analysis package.

35536252,BioTransformer 3.0-a web server for accurately predicting metabolic transformation products.,"BioTransformer 3.0 (https://biotransformer.ca) is a freely available web server that supports accurate, rapid and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction. It combines machine learning approaches with a rule-based system to predict small-molecule metabolism in human tissues, the human gut as well as the external environment (soil and water microbiota). Simply stated, BioTransformer takes a molecular structure as input (SMILES or SDF) and outputs an interactively sortable table of the predicted metabolites or transformation products (SMILES, PNG images) along with the enzymes that are predicted to be responsible for those reactions and richly annotated downloadable files (CSV and JSON). The entire process typically takes less than a minute. Previous versions of BioTransformer focused exclusively on predicting the metabolism of xenobiotics (such as plant natural products, drugs, cosmetics and other synthetic compounds) using a limited number of pre-defined steps and somewhat limited rule-based methods. BioTransformer 3.0 uses much more sophisticated methods and incorporates new databases, new constraints and new prediction modules to not only more accurately predict the metabolic transformation products of exogenous xenobiotics but also the transformation products of endogenous metabolites, such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, organic acids, and lipids. BioTransformer 3.0 can also support customized sequential combinations of these transformations along with multiple iterations to simulate multi-step human biotransformation events. Performance tests indicate that BioTransformer 3.0 is 40-50% more accurate, far less prone to combinatorial 'explosions' and much more comprehensive in terms of metabolite coverage/capabilities than previous versions of BioTransformer.",True,False,5.0,,biotransformer,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,https://biotransformer.ca,https://biotransformer.ca,True,BioTransformer 3.0 (https://biotransformer.ca) is a freely available web server that supports a...,1

37158271,CAVE: a cloud-based platform for analysis and visualization of metabolic pathways.,"Flux balance analysis (FBA) is an important method for calculating optimal pathways to produce industrially important chemicals in genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). However, for biologists, the requirement of coding skills poses a significant obstacle to using FBA for pathway analysis and engineering target identification. Additionally, a time-consuming manual drawing process is often needed to illustrate the mass flow in an FBA-calculated pathway, making it challenging to detect errors or discover interesting metabolic features. To solve this problem, we developed CAVE, a cloud-based platform for the integrated calculation, visualization, examination and correction of metabolic pathways. CAVE can analyze and visualize pathways for over 100 published GEMs or user-uploaded GEMs, allowing for quicker examination and identification of special metabolic features in a particular GEM. Additionally, CAVE offers model modification functions, such as gene/reaction removal or addition, making it easy for users to correct errors found in pathway analysis and obtain more reliable pathways. With a focus on the design and analysis of optimal pathways for biochemicals, CAVE complements existing visualization tools based on manually drawn global maps and can be applied to a broader range of organisms for rational metabolic engineering.

Here, we report an updated server, Group-based Prediction System (GPS) 6.0, for prediction of PK-specific phosphorylation sites (p-sites) in eukaryotes. First, we pre-trained a general model using penalized logistic regression (PLR), deep neural network (DNN), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGMB) on 490 762 non-redundant p-sites in 71 407 proteins. Then, transfer learning was conducted to obtain 577 PK-specific predictors at the group, family and single PK levels, using a well-curated data set of 30 043 known site-specific kinase-substrate relations in 7041 proteins. Together with the evolutionary information, GPS 6.0 could hierarchically predict PK-specific p-sites for 44046 PKs in 185 species. Besides the basic statistics, we also offered the knowledge from 22 public resources to annotate the prediction results, including the experimental evidence, physical interactions, sequence logos, and p-sites in sequences and 3D structures.

39484850,CASRdb: A Publicly Accessible Comprehensive Database for Disease-Associated Calcium-Sensing Receptor Variants.,"<h4>Context</h4>Genetic testing of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene is crucial for confirming diagnoses of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type I (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type I (ADH1). Therefore, we created a publicly accessible comprehensive database of the disease-causing variants of the CASR gene.<h4>Evidence acquisition</h4>We used 2 sources for variant reports: (1) we conducted a systematic review in the Embase and PubMed databases from inception to March 2023, using search strategies associated with CASR. We identified all articles reporting CASR variants associated with disorders of calcium metabolism. (2) Additionally, data associated with pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in the ClinVar and LOVD databases were retrieved. Benign or likely benign variants were excluded. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were included only if they were reported in the literature. We generated a library of CASR variants associated with phenotypes, which has been made available on a website.<h4>Evidence synthesis</h4>We identified a total of 498 variants, of which 121 (24.3%) were associated with ADH1 and 377 (75.7%) with FHH1. Most included variants were identified from the literature (117 activating and 352 inactivating variants), and the majority of these were not documented in ClinVar/LOVD (73/117, 62.4% activating variants; 207/352, 58.8% inactivating variants).<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed CASRdb, a database that compiles information on all CASR variants associated with disorders of calcium metabolism from existing literature and genomic databases.

36453831,CovBinderInPDB: A Structure-Based Covalent Binder Database.,"Covalent inhibition has emerged as a promising orthogonal approach for drug discovery, despite the significant challenge in achieving target specificity. To facilitate the structure-based rational design of target-specific covalent modulators, we developed an integrated computational protocol to curate covalent binders from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Starting from the macromolecular crystallographic information files (mmCIF) in the PDB archive, covalent bond records, which indicate the side chain modification of amino acid residue by a covalent binder, were collected and cleaned. Then, residue-binder adducts, which are products of chemical reactions between targeted residues and covalent binders, were recovered with the help of the Chemical Component Dictionary in PDB. Finally, several strategies were employed to curate the pre-reaction forms of covalent binders from the adducts. Our curated CovBinderInPDB database contains 7375 covalent modifications in which 2189 unique covalent binders target nine types of amino acid residues (Cys, Lys, Ser, Asp, Glu, His, Met, Thr, and Tyr) from 3555 complex structures of 1170 unique protein chains.

The impact of these elements varies according to their location, classification, and their effects on specific genes or regulatory components. Despite their significant roles, a paucity of resources concerning TEs in population-scale genome sequencing remains. Herein, we analyze whole-genome sequencing data sourced from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, encompassing 2500 Korean individuals. To facilitate convenient data access and observation, we developed a web-based database, KTED.

38043216,ListiWiki: A database for the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.,"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram positive foodborne pathogen that regularly causes outbreaks of systemic infectious diseases. The bacterium maintains a facultative intracellular lifestyle; it thrives under a variety of environmental conditions and is able to infect human host cells. L. monocytogenes is genetically tractable and therefore has become an attractive model system to study the mechanisms employed by facultative intracellular bacteria to invade eukaryotic cells and to replicate in their cytoplasm. Besides its importance for basic research, L. monocytogenes also serves as a paradigmatic pathogen in genomic epidemiology, where the relative stability of its genome facilitates successful outbreak detection and elucidation of transmission chains in genomic pathogen surveillance systems. In both terms, it is necessary to keep the annotation of the L. monocytogenes genome up to date. Therefore, we have created the database ListiWiki (http://listiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/) which stores comprehensive information on the widely used L. monocytogenes reference strain EDG-e. ListiWiki is designed to collect information on genes, proteins and RNAs and their relevant functional characteristics, but also further information such as mutant phenotypes, available biological material, and publications. In its present form, ListiWiki combines the most recent annotation of the EDG-e genome with published data on gene essentiality, gene expression and subcellular protein localization.

To promote data-driven biological research, the Korean government announced that all biological data generated from government-funded research projects should be deposited at the Korea BioData Station (K-BDS), which consists of multiple databases for individual data types. Here, we introduce the Korean Nucleotide Archive (KoNA), a repository of nucleotide sequence data. As of July 2022, the Korean Read Archive in KoNA has collected over 477 TB of raw next-generation sequencing data from national genome projects. To ensure data quality and prepare for international alignment, a standard operating procedure was adopted, which is similar to that of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. The standard operating procedure includes quality control processes for submitted data and metadata using an automated pipeline, followed by manual examination. To ensure fast and stable data transfer, a high-speed transmission system called GBox is used in KoNA. Furthermore, the data uploaded to or downloaded from KoNA through GBox can be readily processed using a cloud computing service called Bio-Express. This seamless coupling of KoNA, GBox, and Bio-Express enhances the data experience, including submission, access, and analysis of raw nucleotide sequences.

38715008,GRAVEN: a database of teaching method that applies gestures to represent the neurosurgical approach's blood vessels and nerves.,"<h4>Background</h4>In this era of rapid technological development, medical schools have had to use modern technology to enhance traditional teaching. Online teaching was preferred by many medical schools. However due to the complexity of intracranial anatomy, it was challenging for the students to study this part online, and the students were likely to be tired of neurosurgery, which is disadvantageous to the development of neurosurgery. Therefore, we developed this database to help students learn better neuroanatomy.<h4>Main body</h4>The data were sourced from Rhoton's Cranial Anatomy and Surgical Approaches and Neurosurgery Tricks of the Trade in this database. Then we designed many hand gesture figures connected with the atlas of anatomy. Our database was divided into three parts: intracranial arteries, intracranial veins, and neurosurgery approaches. Each section below contains an atlas of anatomy, and gestures represent vessels and nerves. Pictures of hand gestures and atlas of anatomy are available to view on GRAVEN ( www.graven.cn ) without restrictions for all teachers and students. We recruited 50 undergraduate students and randomly divided them into two groups: using traditional teaching methods or GRAVEN database combined with above traditional teaching methods. Results revealed a significant improvement in academic performance in using GRAVEN database combined with traditional teaching methods compared to the traditional teaching methods.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This database was vital to help students learn about intracranial anatomy and neurosurgical approaches.

36568962,Pancan-MNVQTLdb: systematic identification of multi-nucleotide variant quantitative trait loci in 33 cancer types.,"Multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs) are defined as clusters of two or more nearby variants existing on the same haplotype in an individual. Recent studies have identified millions of MNVs in human populations, but their functions remain largely unknown. Numerous studies have demonstrated that single-nucleotide variants could serve as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by affecting molecular phenotypes. Therefore, we propose that MNVs can also affect molecular phenotypes by influencing regulatory elements. Using the genotype data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first identified 223 759 unique MNVs in 33 cancer types. Then, to decipher the functions of these MNVs, we investigated the associations between MNVs and six molecular phenotypes, including coding gene expression, miRNA expression, lncRNA expression, alternative splicing, DNA methylation and alternative polyadenylation. As a result, we identified 1 397 821 <i>cis</i>-MNVQTLs and 402 381 <i>trans</i>-MNVQTLs. We further performed survival analysis and identified 46 173 MNVQTLs associated with patient overall survival. We also linked the MNVQTLs to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data and identified 119 762 MNVQTLs that overlap with existing GWAS loci.

The unusual properties of these organisms have received interest in multiple fields of biological research, and have found applications in biotechnology, especially in industrial processes. However, there are few listings of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms and their relevant environmental and physiological data. Such repositories can be used to standardize definitions of thermophile and hyperthermophile limits and tolerances and would mitigate the need for extracting organism data from diverse literature sources across multiple, sometimes loosely related, research fields. Therefore, we have developed ThermoBase, a web-based and freely available database which currently houses comprehensive descriptions for 1238 thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms. ThermoBase reports taxonomic, metabolic, environmental, experimental, and physiological information in addition to literature resources. This includes parameters such as coupling ions for chemiosmosis, optimal pH and range, optimal temperature and range, optimal pressure, and optimal salinity.

39436241,EryDB: A Transcriptomic Profile Database for Erythropoiesis and Erythroid-related Diseases.,"Erythropoiesis is a finely regulated and complex process that involves multiple transformations from hematopoietic stem cells to mature red blood cells at hematopoietic sites from the embryonic to adult stages. Investigations into its molecular mechanisms have generated a wealth of expression data, including bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. A comprehensively integrated and well-curated erythropoiesis-specific database will greatly facilitate the mining of gene expression data and enable large-scale research of erythropoiesis and erythroid-related diseases. Here, we present EryDB, an open-access and comprehensive database dedicated to the collection, integration, analysis, and visualization of transcriptomic data for erythropoiesis and erythroid-related diseases. Currently, the database includes expertly curated quality-assured data of 3803 samples and 1,187,119 single cells derived from 107 public studies of three species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Danio rerio), nine tissue types, and five diseases.

39436255,NeoTCR: An Immunoinformatic Database of Experimentally-supported Functional Neoantigen-specific TCR Sequences.,"Neoantigen-based immunotherapy has demonstrated long-lasting antitumor activity. The recognition of neoantigens by T cell receptors (TCRs) is considered a trigger for antitumor responses. Due to the overwhelming number of TCR repertoires in the human genome, pinpointing neoantigen-specific TCRs is a formidable challenge. Recent studies have identified a number of functional neoantigen-specific TCRs, but the corresponding information is scattered across published literature and is difficult to retrieve. To improve access to these data, we developed an immunoinformatic database (NeoTCR) containing a unified description of publicly available neoantigen-specific TCR sequences, as well as relevant information on targeted neoantigens, from experimentally-supported studies across 17 cancer subtypes. A user-friendly web interface allows interactive browsing and running of complex database queries. To facilitate rapid identification of neoantigen-specific TCRs from raw sequencing data, NeoTCR offers a one-stop analysis for annotation and visualization of TCR clonotypes, discovery of existing neoantigen-specific TCRs, and exclusion of bystander virus-associated TCRs. NeoTCR represents a unique tool to expedite future studies of neoantigen-specific TCRs and the development of neoantigen-based immunotherapy.

To assist in studies on the regulatory mechanisms of ncPEPs, we describe here a database called SPENCER (http://spencer.renlab.org). Currently, SPENCER has collected a total of 2806 mass spectrometry (MS) data points from 55 studies, covering 1007 tumor samples and 719 normal samples. Using an MS-based proteomics analysis pipeline, SPENCER identified 29 526 ncPEPs across 15 different cancer types. Specifically, 22 060 of these ncPEPs were experimentally validated in other studies. By comparing tumor and normal samples, the identified ncPEPs were divided into four expression groups: tumor-specific, upregulated in cancer, downregulated in cancer, and others. Additionally, since ncPEPs are potential targets for neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy, SPENCER also predicted the immunogenicity of all the identified ncPEPs by assessing their MHC-I binding affinity, stability, and TCR recognition probability. As a result, 4497 ncPEPs curated in SPENCER were predicted to be immunogenic. Overall, SPENCER will be a useful resource for investigating cancer-associated ncPEPs and may boost further research in cancer.",True,False,4.0,,,spencer,16.0,ok,,bioactive peptides,,spacy,0.0,SPENCER,True,5.0,True,True,http://spencer.renlab.org,http://spencer.renlab.org,True,"...PEPs, we describe here a database called SPENCER (http://spencer.renlab.org).

36458799,NLM-Chem-BC7: manually annotated full-text resources for chemical entity annotation and indexing in biomedical articles.,"The automatic recognition of chemical names and their corresponding database identifiers in biomedical text is an important first step for many downstream text-mining applications. The task is even more challenging when considering the identification of these entities in the article's full text and, furthermore, the identification of candidate substances for that article's metadata [Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) article indexing]. The National Library of Medicine (NLM)-Chem track at BioCreative VII aimed to foster the development of algorithms that can predict with high quality the chemical entities in the biomedical literature and further identify the chemical substances that are candidates for article indexing. As a result of this challenge, the NLM-Chem track produced two comprehensive, manually curated corpora annotated with chemical entities and indexed with chemical substances: the chemical identification corpus and the chemical indexing corpus. The NLM-Chem BioCreative VII (NLM-Chem-BC7) Chemical Identification corpus consists of 204 full-text PubMed Central (PMC) articles, fully annotated for chemical entities by 12 NLM indexers for both span (i.e. named entity recognition) and normalization (i.e. entity linking) using MeSH. This resource was used for the training and testing of the Chemical Identification task to evaluate the accuracy of algorithms in predicting chemicals mentioned in recently published full-text articles. The NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus consists of 1333 recently published PMC articles, equipped with chemical substance indexing by manual experts at the NLM. This resource was used for the evaluation of the Chemical Indexing task, which evaluated the accuracy of algorithms in predicting the chemicals that should be indexed, i.e. appear in the listing of MeSH terms for the document. This set was further enriched after the challenge in two ways: (i) 11 NLM indexers manually verified each of the candidate terms appearing in the prediction results of the challenge participants, but not in the MeSH indexing, and the chemical indexing terms appearing in the MeSH indexing list, but not in the prediction results, and (ii) the challenge organizers algorithmically merged the chemical entity annotations in the full text for all predicted chemical entities and used a statistical approach to keep those with the highest degree of confidence. As a result, the NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus is a gold-standard corpus for chemical indexing of journal articles and a silver-standard corpus for chemical entity identification in full-text journal articles. Together, these resources are currently the most comprehensive resources for chemical entity recognition, and we demonstrate improvements in the chemical entity recognition algorithms. We detail the characteristics of these novel resources and make them available for the community.

35148686,ProtPlat: an efficient pre-training platform for protein classification based on FastText.,"<h4>Background</h4>For the past decades, benefitting from the rapid growth of protein sequence data in public databases, a lot of machine learning methods have been developed to predict physicochemical properties or functions of proteins using amino acid sequence features. However, the prediction performance often suffers from the lack of labeled data. In recent years, pre-training methods have been widely studied to address the small-sample issue in computer vision and natural language processing fields, while specific pre-training techniques for protein sequences are few.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we propose a pre-training platform for representing protein sequences, called ProtPlat, which uses the Pfam database to train a three-layer neural network, and then uses specific training data from downstream tasks to fine-tune the model. ProtPlat can learn good representations for amino acids, and at the same time achieve efficient classification. We conduct experiments on three protein classification tasks, including the identification of type III secreted effectors, the prediction of subcellular localization, and the recognition of signal peptides. The experimental results show that the pre-training can enhance model performance effectively and ProtPlat is competitive to the state-of-the-art predictors, especially for small datasets. We implement the ProtPlat platform as a web service ( https://compbio.sjtu.edu.cn/protplat ) that is accessible to the public.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To enhance the feature representation of protein amino acid sequences and improve the performance of sequence-based classification tasks, we develop ProtPlat, a general platform for the pre-training of protein sequences, which is featured by a large-scale supervised training based on Pfam database and an efficient learning model, FastText.

A low percentage of <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> species complex (RSSC) strains possess the CRISPR array and the CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) that would confer immunity against various phages. To provide a wide-range screen of the CRISPR presence in the RSSC, we analyzed 378 genomes of RSSC strains to find the CRISPR locus.

In addition, we performed further analysis to identify the respective phages that are restricted by the CRISPR arrays. We found 252 different phages infecting different strains of the RSSC, by means of the identification of similarities between the protospacers in phages and spacers in bacteria.

However, they are limited by the unpredictability of the structures and functions. Therefore, computational and data-driven pre-evaluation could enable more efficient NP-inspired drug development. Since NPs possess structural features that differ from synthetic compounds, models trained with synthetic compounds may not perform well with NPs. There is also an urgent demand for well-curated databases and user-friendly predictive tools. We presented a comprehensive online web platform (InflamNat, http://www.inflamnat.com/ or http://39.104.56.4/ ) for anti-inflammatory natural product research. InflamNat is a database containing the physicochemical properties, cellular anti-inflammatory bioactivities, and molecular targets of 1351 NPs that tested on their anti-inflammatory activities.

37822561,ASCARIS: Positional feature annotation and protein structure-based representation of single amino acid variations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genomic variations may cause deleterious effects on protein functionality and perturb biological processes. Elucidating the effects of variations is critical for developing novel treatment strategies for diseases of genetic origin. Computational approaches have been aiding the work in this field by modeling and analyzing the mutational landscape. However, new approaches are required, especially for accurate representation and data-centric analysis of sequence variations.<h4>Method</h4>In this study, we propose ASCARIS (Annotation and StruCture-bAsed RepresentatIon of Single amino acid variations), a method for the featurization (i.e., quantitative representation) of single amino acid variations (SAVs), which could be used for a variety of purposes, such as predicting their functional effects or building multi-omics-based integrative models. ASCARIS utilizes the direct and spatial correspondence between the location of the SAV on the sequence/structure and 30 different types of positional feature annotations (e.g., active/lipidation/glycosylation sites; calcium/metal/DNA binding, inter/transmembrane regions, etc.), along with structural features and physicochemical properties. The main novelty of this method lies in constructing reusable numerical representations of SAVs via functional annotations.<h4>Results</h4>We statistically analyzed the relationship between these features and the consequences of variations and found that each carries information in this regard. To investigate potential applications of ASCARIS, we trained variant effect prediction models that utilize our SAV representations as input. We carried out an ablation study and a comparison against the state-of-the-art methods and observed that ASCARIS has a competing and complementary performance against widely-used predictors. ASCARIS can be used alone or in combination with other approaches to represent SAVs from a functional perspective.

37037149,REL-NPMI: Exploring genotype and phenotype relationship of pancreatitis based on improved normalized point-by-point mutual information.,"Pancreatitis is a relatively serious disease caused by the self-digestion of trypsin in the pancreas. The generation of diseases is closely related to gene and phenotype information. Generally, gene-phenotype relations are mainly obtained through clinical experiments, but the cost is huge. With the amount of published biomedical literature increasing exponentially, it carries a wealth of disease-related gene and phenotype information. This study provided an effective way to obtain disease-related gene and phenotype information. To our best knowledge, this work first attempted to explore relationships between genotype and phenotype about the pancreatitis from the computational perspective. It mined 6152 genes and 76,753 pairs of genotype and phenotype extracted from the biomedical literature about pancreatitis using text mining. Based on the above 76,753 pairs, the study proposed an improved normalized point-wise mutual information (REL-NPMI) model to optimize gene-phenotype relations related to pancreatitis, and obtained 12,562 gene-phenotype pairs which may be related to pancreatitis. The extracted top 20 results were validated and evaluated. The experimental results show that the method is promising for exploring pancreatitis' molecular mechanism, thus it provides a computational way for studying pancreatitis' disease pathogenesis.

One of the goals of the Consortium is to facilitate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management and the integration of datasets which requires data sharing, along with structured vocabularies and/or ontologies. Two AgBioData working groups, focused on Data Sharing and Ontologies, respectively, conducted a Consortium-wide survey to assess the current status and future needs of the members in those areas. A total of 33 researchers responded to the survey, representing 37 databases. Results suggest that data-sharing practices by AgBioData databases are in a fairly healthy state, but it is not clear whether this is true for all metadata and data types across all databases; and that, ontology use has not substantially changed since a similar survey was conducted in 2017. Based on our evaluation of the survey results, we recommend (i) providing training for database personnel in a specific data-sharing techniques, as well as in ontology use; (ii) further study on what metadata is shared, and how well it is shared among databases; (iii) promoting an understanding of data sharing and ontologies in the stakeholder community; (iv) improving data sharing and ontologies for specific phenotypic data types and formats; and (v) lowering specific barriers to data sharing and ontology use, by identifying sustainability solutions, and the identification, promotion, or development of data standards. Combined, these improvements are likely to help AgBioData databases increase development efforts towards improved ontology use, and data sharing via programmatic means.

39413799,Mut-Map: Comprehensive Computational Pipeline for Structural Mapping and Analysis of Cancer-Associated Mutations.,"Understanding the functional impact of genetic mutations on protein structures is essential for advancing cancer research and developing targeted therapies. The main challenge lies in accurately mapping these mutations to protein structures and analysing their effects on protein function. To address this, Mut-Map (https://genemutation.org/) is a comprehensive computational pipeline designed to integrate mutation data from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer database with protein structural data from the Protein Data Bank and AlphaFold models. The pipeline begins by taking a UniProt ID and proceeds through mapping corresponding Protein Data Bank structures, renumbering residues, and assessing disorder percentages. It then overlays mutation data, categorizes mutations based on structural context, and visualizes them using advanced tools like MolStar. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of how mutations may disrupt protein function by affecting key regions such as DNA interfaces, ligand-binding sites, and dimer interactions. To validate the pipeline, a case study on the TP53 gene, a critical tumour suppressor often mutated in cancers, was conducted. The analysis highlighted the most frequent mutations occurring at the DNA-binding interface, providing insights into their potential role in cancer progression.

The recent introduction of large language models (LLMs) offers a means to aggregate large amounts of data into a queryable format, but the output can contain inaccurate or false claims known as hallucinations. To minimize such hallucinations and produce high-quality knowledge-based outputs, the abstracts of over 60 000 plant research articles are compiled into a Chroma database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Then linguistic data are used from 13 993 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) phenotypes and 23 323 gene functions to fine-tune the LLM Llama3-8B, producing PlantGPT, a virtual expert in Arabidopsis phenotype-gene research. By evaluating answers to test questions, it is demonstrated that PlantGPT outperforms general LLMs in answering specialized questions.

37530223,Milletdb: a multi-omics database to accelerate the research of functional genomics and molecular breeding of millets.,"Millets are a class of nutrient-rich coarse cereals with high resistance to abiotic stress; thus, they guarantee food security for people living in areas with extreme climatic conditions and provide stress-related genetic resources for other crops. However, no platform is available to provide a comprehensive and systematic multi-omics analysis for millets, which seriously hinders the mining of stress-related genes and the molecular breeding of millets. Here, a free, web-accessible, user-friendly millets multi-omics database platform (Milletdb, http://milletdb.novogene.com) has been developed. The Milletdb contains six millets and their one related species genomes, graph-based pan-genomics of pearl millet, and stress-related multi-omics data, which enable Milletdb to be the most complete millets multi-omics database available. We stored GWAS (genome-wide association study) results of 20 yield-related trait data obtained under three environmental conditions [field (no stress), early drought and late drought] for 2 years in the database, allowing users to identify stress-related genes that support yield improvement. Milletdb can simplify the functional genomics analysis of millets by providing users with 20 different tools (e.g., 'Gene mapping', 'Co-expression', 'KEGG/GO Enrichment' analysis, etc.). On the Milletdb platform, a gene PMA1G03779.1 was identified through 'GWAS', which has the potential to modulate yield and respond to different environmental stresses. Using the tools provided by Milletdb, we found that the stress-related PLATZs TFs (transcription factors) family expands in 87.5% of millet accessions and contributes to vegetative growth and abiotic stress responses.

39530225,The evolution of dbSNP: 25 years of impact in genomic research.,"The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP), established in 1998 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), has been a critical resource in genomics for cataloging small genetic variations. Originally focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), dbSNP has since expanded to include a variety of genetic variants, playing a key role in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), population genetics, pharmacogenomics, and cancer research. Over 25 years, dbSNP has grown to include more than 4.4 billion submitted SNPs and 1.1 billion unique reference SNPs, providing essential data for identifying disease-related genetic variants and studying human diversity. Integrating large-scale projects like 1000 Genomes, gnomAD, TOPMed, and ALFA has expanded dbSNP's catalog of human genetic variation, increasing its usefulness for research and clinical applications.

Thus, some reads contain part of the non-templated polyadenosine tails, providing direct evidence for the sites of 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation on the respective RNAs. Taking advantage of this property, we recently developed the SCINPAS workflow to infer polyadenylation sites (PASs) from scRNA-seq data. Here, we used this workflow to construct version 3.0 (v3.0, https://polyasite.unibas.ch/) of the PolyASite Atlas from a big compendium of publicly available human, mouse and worm scRNA-seq datasets obtained from healthy tissues. As the resolution of scRNA-seq was too low for robust detection of cell-level differences in PAS usage, we aggregated samples based on their tissue-of-origin to construct tissue-level catalogs of PASs. These provide qualitatively new information about PAS usage, in comparison to the previous PAS catalogs that were based on bulk 3' end sequencing experiments primarily in cell lines. In the new version, we document stringency levels associated with each PAS so that users can balance sensitivity and specificity in their analysis.

Recently, the NPs have emerged as the ideal candidates to combine with other therapeutic strategies to deal with the persistent challenge of conventional therapy, and the molecular regulation mechanism underlying these combinations is crucial for the related communities. Thus, it is urgently demanded to comprehensively provide the disease-specific molecular regulation data for various NP-based drug combinations. However, no database has been developed yet to describe such valuable information. In this study, a newly developed database entitled 'Natural Product-based Drug Combination and Its Disease-specific Molecular Regulation (NPCDR)' was thus introduced. This database was unique in (a) providing the comprehensive information of NP-based drug combinations & describing their clinically or experimentally validated therapeutic effect, (b) giving the disease-specific molecular regulation data for a number of NP-based drug combinations, (c) fully referencing all NPs, drugs, regulated molecules/pathways by cross-linking them to the available databases describing their biological or pharmaceutical characteristics. Therefore, NPCDR is expected to have great implications for the future practice of network pharmacology, medical biochemistry, drug design, and medicinal chemistry.

40645675,MDDB: A public databank of host microRNAs in Tuberculosis diagnosis.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge due to its high mortality rate. Several factors contribute significantly including delayed diagnosis, emergence of drug resistance, and biofilm formation. Although various diagnostic methods are available for TB, such as sputum smear microscopy, culture techniques, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). They have notable limitations, including false positives and negatives, timeliness, and high cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an early and accurate diagnostic approach to control the infection. MicroRNA (miRNA)-based diagnostics have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the potential for earlier detection and reduced false-positivity. However, this field is still in development and requires specialized tools to accelerate miRNA research, streamline the process, and facilitate the creation of innovative diagnostic methods. To address this need, the MicroRNA Disease Databank (MDDB) was developed as a centralized platform providing extensive miRNA-related information.

38630617,RNAscape: geometric mapping and customizable visualization of RNA structure.,"Analyzing and visualizing the tertiary structure and complex interactions of RNA is essential for being able to mechanistically decipher their molecular functions in vivo. Secondary structure visualization software can portray many aspects of RNA; however, these layouts are often unable to preserve topological correspondence since they do not consider tertiary interactions between different regions of an RNA molecule. Likewise, quaternary interactions between two or more interacting RNA molecules are not considered in secondary structure visualization tools. The RNAscape webserver produces visualizations that can preserve topological correspondence while remaining both visually intuitive and structurally insightful. RNAscape achieves this by designing a mathematical structural mapping algorithm which prioritizes the helical segments, reflecting their tertiary organization. Non-helical segments are mapped in a way that minimizes structural clutter. RNAscape runs a plotting script that is designed to generate publication-quality images. RNAscape natively supports non-standard nucleotides, multiple base-pairing annotation styles and requires no programming experience. RNAscape can also be used to analyze RNA/DNA hybrid structures and DNA topologies, including G-quadruplexes.

36484479,Emati: a recommender system for biomedical literature based on supervised learning.,"The scientific literature continues to grow at an ever-increasing rate. Considering that thousands of new articles are published every week, it is obvious how challenging it is to keep up with newly published literature on a regular basis. Using a recommender system that improves the user experience in the online environment can be a solution to this problem. In the present study, we aimed to develop a web-based article recommender service, called Emati. Since the data are text-based by nature and we wanted our system to be independent of the number of users, a content-based approach has been adopted in this study. A supervised machine learning model has been proposed to generate article recommendations. Two different supervised learning approaches, namely the naïve Bayes model with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer and the state-of-the-art language model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), have been implemented. In the first one, a list of documents is converted into TF-IDF-weighted features and fed into a classifier to distinguish relevant articles from irrelevant ones. Multinomial naïve Bayes algorithm is used as a classifier since, along with the class label, it also gives the probability that the input belongs to this class. The second approach is based on fine-tuning the pretrained state-of-the-art language model BERT for the text classification task. Emati provides a weekly updated list of article recommendations and presents it to the user, sorted by probability scores. New article recommendations are also sent to users' email addresses on a weekly basis. Additionally, Emati has a personalized search feature to search online services' (such as PubMed and arXiv) content and have the results sorted by the user's classifier.

However, finding new Acrs has been challenging due to their low sequence similarity. Recent advances in protein structure prediction have opened new pathways for Acr discovery by using 3D structure similarity. This study presents an updated AcrDB, with the following new features not available in other databases: (1) predicted Acrs from human gut virome databases, (2) Acr structures predicted by AlphaFold2, (3) a structural similarity search function to allow users to submit new sequences and structures to search against 3D structures of experimentally known Acrs. The updated AcrDB contains predicted 3D structures of 795 candidate Acrs with structural similarity (TM-score ≥0.7) to known Acrs supported by at least two of the three non-sequence similarity-based tools (TM-Vec, Foldseek, AcrPred). Among these candidate Acrs, 121 are supported by all three tools. AcrDB also includes 3D structures of 122 experimentally characterized Acr proteins. The 121 most confident candidate Acrs were combined with the 122 known Acrs and clustered into 163 sequence similarity-based Acr families. The 163 families were further subject to a structure similarity-based hierarchical clustering, revealing structural similarity between 44 candidate Acr (cAcr) families and 119 known Acr families. The bacterial hosts of these 163 Acr families are mainly from Bacillota, Pseudomonadota, and Bacteroidota, which are all dominant gut bacterial phyla. Many of these 163 Acr families are also co-localized in Acr operons.

However, many of the available information about human allele frequencies, and about clinical drug-gene interactions, is based on American and European populations. PharmaKoVariome database was constructed to support genetic testing for safe prescription and drug development. It consolidated and stored 2507 diseases, 11 459 drugs and 61 627 drug-target or druggable genes from public databases. PharmaKoVariome precomputed ethnic-specific abundant variants for approximately 120 M single-nucleotide variants of drug-target or druggable genes. A user can search by gene symbol, drug name, disease and reference SNP ID number (rsID) to statistically analyse the frequency of ethnical variations, such as odds ratio and P-values for related genes. In an example study, we observed five Korean-enriched variants in the CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 genes, one of which (rs1065852) is known to be incapable of metabolizing drug. It is also shown that 4-6% of North and East Asians have risk factors for drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 gene. Therefore, PharmaKoVariome is a useful database for pharmaceutical or diagnostic companies for developing diagnostic technologies that can be applied in the Asian PGx industry.

34551435,PncsHub: a platform for annotating and analyzing non-classically secreted proteins in Gram-positive bacteria.,"From industry to food to health, bacteria play an important role in all facets of life. Some of the most important bacteria have been purposely engineered to produce commercial quantities of antibiotics and therapeutics, and non-classical secretion systems are at the forefront of these technologies. Unlike the classical Sec or Tat pathways, non-classically secreted proteins share few common characteristics and use much more diverse secretion pathways for protein transport. Systematically categorizing and investigating the non-classically secreted proteins will enable a deeper understanding of their associated secretion mechanisms and provide a landscape of the Gram-positive secretion pathway distribution. We therefore developed PncsHub (https://pncshub.erc.monash.edu/), the first universal platform for comprehensively annotating and analyzing Gram-positive bacterial non-classically secreted proteins. PncsHub catalogs 4,914 non-classically secreted proteins, which are delicately categorized into 8 subtypes (including the 'unknown' subtype) and annotated with data compiled from up to 26 resources and visualisation tools. It incorporates state-of-the-art predictors to identify new and homologous non-classically secreted proteins and includes three analytical modules to visualise the relationships between known and putative non-classically secreted proteins.

Numerous theories have been proposed in recent years, each gaining independent empirical support. Currently, there is no comprehensive, quantitative and theory-neutral overview of the field that enables an evaluation of how theoretical frameworks interact with empirical research. We provide a bird's eye view of studies that interpreted their findings in light of at least one of four leading neuroscientific theories of consciousness (N = 412 experiments), asking how methodological choices of the researchers might affect the final conclusions. We found that supporting a specific theory can be predicted solely from methodological choices, irrespective of findings. Furthermore, most studies interpret their findings post hoc, rather than a priori testing critical predictions of the theories.

To reveal functional features of the Hyp proteome, we integrated various data sources for deep proteome profiling of the Hyp proteome in humans and developed HypDB (https://www.HypDB.site), an annotated database and web server for Hyp proteome. HypDB provides site-specific evidence of modification based on extensive LC-MS analysis and literature mining with 14,413 nonredundant Hyp sites on 5,165 human proteins including 3,383 Class I and 4,335 Class II sites. Annotation analysis revealed significant enrichment of Hyp on key functional domains and tissue-specific distribution of Hyp abundance across 26 types of human organs and fluids and 6 cell lines. The network connectivity analysis further revealed a critical role of Hyp in mediating protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the spectral library generated by HypDB enabled data-independent analysis (DIA) of clinical tissues and the identification of novel Hyp biomarkers in lung cancer and kidney cancer.

37566638,Practical sampling of constraint-based models: Optimized thinning boosts CHRR performance.,"Thinning is a sub-sampling technique to reduce the memory footprint of Markov chain Monte Carlo. Despite being commonly used, thinning is rarely considered efficient. For sampling constraint-based models, a highly relevant use-case in systems biology, we here demonstrate that thinning boosts computational and, thereby, sampling efficiencies of the widely used Coordinate Hit-and-Run with Rounding (CHRR) algorithm. By benchmarking CHRR with thinning with simplices and genome-scale metabolic networks of up to thousands of dimensions, we find a substantial increase in computational efficiency compared to unthinned CHRR, in our examples by orders of magnitude, as measured by the effective sample size per time (ESS/t), with performance gains growing with polytope (effective network) dimension. Using a set of benchmark models we derive a ready-to-apply guideline for tuning thinning to efficient and effective use of compute resources without requiring additional coding effort. Our guideline is validated using three (out-of-sample) large-scale networks and we show that it allows sampling convex polytopes uniformly to convergence in a fraction of time, thereby unlocking the rigorous investigation of hitherto intractable models. The derivation of our guideline is explained in detail, allowing future researchers to update it as needed as new model classes and more training data becomes available. CHRR with deliberate utilization of thinning thereby paves the way to keep pace with progressing model sizes derived with the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) tool set.

In 2024, the genomes of 500 plant species were published, including 370 sequenced for the first time. Tracking and providing access to published plant genomes (now covering more than 1800 species) is an invaluable service for plant researchers. PubPlant is an online resource that serves this purpose by cataloging published plant genome sequences and offering multiple visualizations (https://www.plabipd.de/pubplant_main.html). It includes a chronology of genome publications, and cladograms to display the phylogenetic relationships among the sequenced plants. An overview diagram for seed plants highlights taxonomic orders and families with sequenced species and reveals those that have been overlooked thus far.

The Mondo ontology initiative allows a standardization of the disease name into specific codes, making it possible a computational association between genes, variants, diseases, and their effects on biological processes. Here, we tackle the problem of which biological processes enzymes can affect when the protein variant is disease-associated. We adopt Reactome to describe human biological processes, and by mapping disease-associated enzymes in the Reactome pathways, we establish a Reactome-disease association. This allows a novel categorization of human monogenic and polygenic diseases based on Reactome pathways and reactions. Our analysis aims at dissecting the complexity of the human genetic disease universe, highlighting all the possible links within diseases and Reactome pathways. The novel mapping helps understanding the biochemical/molecular biology of the disease and allows a direct glimpse on the present knowledge of other molecules involved.

35765650,PERISCOPE-Opt: Machine learning-based prediction of optimal fermentation conditions and yields of recombinant periplasmic protein expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>.,"Optimization of the fermentation process for recombinant protein production (RPP) is often resource-intensive. Machine learning (ML) approaches are helpful in minimizing the experimentations and find vast applications in RPP. However, these ML-based tools primarily focus on features with respect to amino-acid-sequence, ruling out the influence of fermentation process conditions. The present study combines the features derived from fermentation process conditions with that from amino acid-sequence to construct an ML-based model that predicts the maximal protein yields and the corresponding fermentation conditions for the expression of target recombinant protein in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> periplasm. Two sets of XGBoost classifiers were employed in the first stage to classify the expression levels of the target protein as high (>50 mg/L), medium (between 0.5 and 50 mg/L), or low (<0.5 mg/L). The second-stage framework consisted of three regression models involving support vector machines and random forest to predict the expression yields corresponding to each expression-level-class. Independent tests showed that the predictor achieved an overall average accuracy of 75% and a Pearson coefficient correlation of 0.91 for the correctly classified instances. Therefore, our model offers a reliable substitution of numerous trial-and-error experiments to identify the optimal fermentation conditions and yield for RPP.

Immunotherapy, specifically adoptive cell transfer of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells (TCR-T therapy), has shown promise in engaging the immune system for cancer treatment. One of the biggest challenges in the development of TCR-T therapies is the proper prediction of the pairing between TCRs and peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLAs). Modern computational immunology, using artificial intelligence (AI)-based platforms, provides the means to optimize the speed and accuracy of TCR screening and discovery.<h4>Objective</h4>This study proposes an observational clinical trial protocol to collect patient samples and generate a database of pHLA:TCR sequences to aid the development of an AI-based platform for efficient selection of specific TCRs.<h4>Methods</h4>The multicenter observational study, involving 8 participating hospitals, aims to enroll patients diagnosed with stage II, III, or IV colorectal cancer adenocarcinoma.<h4>Results</h4>Patient recruitment has recently been completed, with 100 participants enrolled. Primary tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples have been obtained, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been isolated and cryopreserved. Nucleic acid extraction (DNA and RNA) has been performed in 86 cases. Additionally, 57 samples underwent whole exome sequencing to determine the presence of somatic mutations and RNA sequencing for gene expression profiling.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of this study may have a significant impact on the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based diagnosis is now supplementing existing gold-standard microbiology methods for rapid and more precise AST, and therefore, EUCAST recommended quality criteria to assess whole-genome sequence for reporting the same. In this study, these three global standards, MIC breakpoints, phenotypic classification, and genome quality, are applied to the largest publicly available data for Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), the most critical priority pathogen identified by WHO.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The drug sensitivity profile and genomes for isolates of AB were obtained from PATRIC and evaluated with respect to AST standards (CLSI and EUCAST). Whole genome quality assessment and antimicrobial resistance mapping is performed with QUAST and ABRicate, respectively. Four in-house methods are developed for mapping standards and are integrated into a Galaxy workflow based system, Galaxy-ASIST. Analysis of the extent of agreement between CLSI 2022 and EUCAST 2022 for antibiotics was carried out using Cohen's kappa statistics.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>An automated pipeline, Galaxy-ASIST, is designed and developed for the characterization of clinical isolates based on these standards. Evaluation of over 6,500 AB strains using Galaxy-ASIST indicated that only 10% of the publicly available datasets have metadata to implement these standards. Furthermore, given that CLSI and EUCAST have different MIC breakpoints, discrepancies are observed in the classification of resistant and susceptible isolates following these standards. It is, therefore, imperative that platforms are developed that allow the evaluation of ever increasing phenotypic and genome sequence datasets for AST. Galaxy-ASIST offers a centralized repository and a structured metadata architecture to provide a single globally acceptable framework for AST profiling of clinical isolates based on global standards. The platform also offers subsequent fine mapping of antimicrobial-resistant determinants.

39198545,Emotional palette: a computational mapping of aesthetic experiences evoked by visual art.,"Despite the evolutionary history and cultural significance of visual art, the structure of aesthetic experiences it evokes has only attracted recent scientific attention. What kinds of experience does visual art evoke? Guided by Semantic Space Theory, we identify the concepts that most precisely describe people's aesthetic experiences using new computational techniques. Participants viewed 1457 artworks sampled from diverse cultural and historical traditions and reported on the emotions they felt and their perceived artwork qualities. Results show that aesthetic experiences are high-dimensional, comprising 25 categories of feeling states. Extending well beyond hedonism and broad evaluative judgments (e.g., pleasant/unpleasant), aesthetic experiences involve emotions of daily social living (e.g., ""sad"", ""joy""), the imagination (e.g., ""psychedelic"", ""mysterious""), profundity (e.g., ""disgust"", ""awe""), and perceptual qualities attributed to the artwork (e.g., ""whimsical"", ""disorienting""). Aesthetic emotions and perceptual qualities jointly predict viewers' liking of the artworks, indicating that we conceptualize aesthetic experiences in terms of the emotions we feel but also the qualities we perceive in the artwork. Aesthetic experiences are often mixed and lie along continuous gradients between categories rather than within discrete clusters.

38502608,FGCD: a database of fungal gene clusters related to secondary metabolism.,"Fungal secondary metabolites are not necessary for growth, but they are important for fungal metabolism and ecology because they provide selective advantages for competition, survival and interactions with the environment. These various metabolites are widely used as medicinal precursors and insecticides. Secondary metabolism genes are commonly arranged in clusters along chromosomes, which allow for the coordinate control of complete pathways. In this study, we created the Fungal Gene Cluster Database to store, retrieve, and visualize secondary metabolite gene cluster information across fungal species. The database was created by merging data from RNA sequencing, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, genome browser, enrichment analysis and the R Shiny web framework to visualize and query putative gene clusters. This database facilitated the rapid and thorough examination of significant gene clusters across fungal species by detecting, defining and graphically displaying the architecture, organization and expression patterns of secondary metabolite gene clusters. In general, this genomic resource makes use of the tremendous chemical variety of the products of these ecologically and biotechnologically significant gene clusters to our further understanding of fungal secondary metabolism.

40273444,A Database for Large-Scale Docking and Experimental Results.,"The rapid expansion of readily accessible compounds over the past six years has transformed molecular docking, improving hit rates and affinities. While many millions of molecules may score well in a docking campaign, the results are rarely fully shared, hindering the benchmarking of machine learning and chemical space exploration methods that seek to explore the expanding chemical spaces. To address this gap, we develop a website providing access to recent large library campaigns, including poses, scores, and <i>in vitro</i> results for campaigns against 11 targets, with 6.3 billion molecules docked and 3729 compounds experimentally tested. In a simple proof-of-concept study that speaks to the new library's utility, we use the new database to train machine learning models to predict docking scores and to find the top 0.01% scoring molecules while evaluating only 1% of the library. Even in these proof-of-concept studies, some interesting trends emerge: unsurprisingly, as models train on larger sets, they perform better; less expectedly, models could achieve high correlations with docking scores and yet still fail to enrich the new docking-discovered ligands, or even the top 0.01% of docking-ranked molecules. It will be interesting to see how these trends develop for methods more sophisticated than the simple proof-of-concept studies undertaken here; the database is openly available at lsd.docking.org.",True,False,4.0,,database for large-scale docking and experimental results,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,lsd.docking.org,lsd.docking.org,True,...ertaken here; the database is openly available at lsd.docking.org.,1

This poses significant challenges on precise literature retrieval for author name queries, a common behavior in biomedical literature search. In response, we present a comprehensive dataset of disambiguated authors. Specifically, we complement the automatic PubMed Computed Authors algorithm with the latest ORCID data for improved accuracy. As a result, the enhanced algorithm achieves high performance in author name disambiguation, and subsequently our dataset contains more than 21 million disambiguated authors for over 35 million PubMed articles and is incrementally updated on a weekly basis. More importantly, we make the dataset publicly available for the community such that it can be utilized in a wide variety of potential applications beyond assisting PubMed's author name queries. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for best practices of authors pertaining to use of their names.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The PubMed Computed Authors dataset is publicly available for bulk download at: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/ComputedAuthors/.

36162041,Secondary Prevention of Cervical Cancer: ASCO Resource-Stratified Guideline Update.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To update resource-stratified, evidence-based recommendations on secondary prevention of cervical cancer globally.<h4>Methods</h4>American Society of Clinical Oncology convened a multidisciplinary, multinational Expert Panel to produce recommendations reflecting four resource-tiered settings. A review of existing guidelines, formal consensus-based process, and modified ADAPTE process to adapt existing guidelines was conducted. Other experts participated in formal consensus.<h4>Results</h4>This guideline update reflects changes in evidence since the previous update. Five existing guidelines were identified and reviewed, and adapted recommendations form the evidence base. Cost-effectiveness analyses provided indirect evidence to inform consensus, which resulted in ≥ 75% agreement.<h4>Recommendations</h4>Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is recommended in all resource settings; visual inspection with acetic acid may be used in basic settings. Recommended age ranges and frequencies vary by the following setting: maximal: age 25-65 years, every 5 years; enhanced: age 30-65 years, if two consecutive negative tests at 5-year intervals, then every 10 years; limited: age 30-49 years, every 10 years; basic: age 30-49 years, one to three times per lifetime. For basic settings, visual assessment is used to determine treatment eligibility; in other settings, genotyping with cytology or cytology alone is used to determine treatment. For basic settings, treatment is recommended if abnormal triage results are obtained; in other settings, abnormal triage results followed by colposcopy is recommended. For basic settings, treatment options are thermal ablation or loop electrosurgical excision procedure; for other settings, loop electrosurgical excision procedure or ablation is recommended; with a 12-month follow-up in all settings. Women who are HIV-positive should be screened with HPV testing after diagnosis, twice as many times per lifetime as the general population. Screening is recommended at 6 weeks postpartum in basic settings; in other settings, screening is recommended at 6 months. In basic settings without mass screening, infrastructure for HPV testing, diagnosis, and treatment should be developed.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/resource-stratified-guidelines.",True,False,5.0,,secondary prevention of cervical cancer: asco resource-stratified guideline update,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Secondary Prevention of Cervical Cancer,True,3.0,False,False,http://www.asco.org/resource-stratified-guidelines,http://www.asco.org/resource-stratified-guidelines,True,,1

Incomplete knowledge of best practices, progression of disease, and its impact could result in fallible care. Data on symptoms and advancement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to critical care admission have not been captured or communicated well between international organizations experiencing the same impact from the virus. This led to the expedited need for establishing international communication and data collection on the critical care patients admitted with COVID-19.<h4>Objective</h4>Developing a global registry to collect patient data in the critical care setting was imperative with the goal of analyzing and ameliorating outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective, observational global registry database was put together to record extensive deidentified clinical information for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>Project management was crucial for prompt implementation of the registry for synchronization, improving efficiency, increasing innovation, and fostering global collaboration for valuable data collection. The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery VIRUS (Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study): COVID-19 Registry would compile data for crucial longitudinal outcomes for disease, treatment, and research. The agile project management approach expedited establishing the registry in 15 days and submission of institutional review board agreement for 250 participating sites.

36549590,Native Size-Exclusion Chromatography-Based Mass Spectrometry Reveals New Components of the Early Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibition Response Among Limited Global Changes.,"The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) works in concert with co-chaperones to stabilize its client proteins, which include multiple drivers of oncogenesis and malignant progression. Pharmacologic inhibitors of HSP90 have been observed to exert a wide range of effects on the proteome, including depletion of client proteins, induction of heat shock proteins, dissociation of co-chaperones from HSP90, disruption of client protein signaling networks, and recruitment of the protein ubiquitylation and degradation machinery-suggesting widespread remodeling of cellular protein complexes. However, proteomics studies to date have focused on inhibitor-induced changes in total protein levels, often overlooking protein complex alterations. Here, we use size-exclusion chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) to characterize the early changes in native protein complexes following treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor tanespimycin (17-AAG) for 8 h in the HT29 colon adenocarcinoma cell line. After confirming the signature cellular response to HSP90 inhibition (e.g., induction of heat shock proteins, decreased total levels of client proteins), we were surprised to find only modest perturbations to the global distribution of protein elution profiles in inhibitor-treated HT29 cells at this relatively early time-point. Similarly, co-chaperones that co-eluted with HSP90 displayed no clear difference between control and treated conditions. However, two distinct analysis strategies identified multiple inhibitor-induced changes, including known and unknown components of the HSP90-dependent proteome. We validate two of these-the actin-binding protein Anillin and the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 complex-as novel HSP90 inhibitor-modulated proteins. We present this dataset as a resource for the HSP90, proteostasis, and cancer communities (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/shiny/HSP90/SEC-MS/), laying the groundwork for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies related to HSP90 pharmacology.

40057225,Yeast Knowledge Graphs Database for Exploring Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces Pombe.,"Biomedical literature contains an extensive wealth of information on gene and protein function across various biological processes and diseases. However, navigating this vast and often restricted-access data can be challenging, making it difficult to extract specific insights efficiently. In this study, we introduce a high-throughput pipeline that leverages OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model (GPT) to automate the extraction and analysis of gene function information. We applied this approach to 84,427 publications on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 6,452 publications on Schizosaccharomyces pombe, identifying 3,432,749 relationships for budding yeast and 421,198 relationships for S. pombe. This resulted in a comprehensive, searchable online Knowledge Graph database, available at yeast.connectome.tools and spombe.connectome.tools, which offers users extensive access to various interactions and pathways.

40140564,A human brain map of mitochondrial respiratory capacity and diversity.,"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) powers brain activity<sup>1,2</sup>, and mitochondrial defects are linked to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders<sup>3,4</sup>. To understand the basis of brain activity and behaviour, there is a need to define the molecular energetic landscape of the brain<sup>5-10</sup>. Here, to bridge the scale gap between cognitive neuroscience and cell biology, we developed a physical voxelization approach to partition a frozen human coronal hemisphere section into 703 voxels comparable to neuroimaging resolution (3 × 3 × 3 mm). In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes, including OXPHOS enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity. We show that the human brain contains diverse mitochondrial phenotypes driven by both topology and cell types. Compared with white matter, grey matter contains >50% more mitochondria. Moreover, the mitochondria in grey matter are biochemically optimized for energy transformation, particularly among recently evolved cortical brain regions. Scaling these data to the whole brain, we created a backwards linear regression model that integrates several neuroimaging modalities<sup>11</sup> to generate a brain-wide map of mitochondrial distribution and specialization. This model predicted mitochondrial characteristics in an independent brain region of the same donor brain. This approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain function.

37750851,Towards AI-augmented radiology education: a web-based application for perception training in chest X-ray nodule detection.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications for augmenting radiological education are underexplored. Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of simulation in radiological perception training. This study aimed to develop and make available a pure web-based application called <i>Perception Trainer</i> for perception training in lung nodule detection in chest X-rays.<h4>Methods</h4>Based on open-access data, we trained a deep-learning model for lung segmentation in chest X-rays. Subsequently, an algorithm for artificial lung nodule generation was implemented and combined with the segmentation model to allow on-the-fly procedural insertion of lung nodules in chest X-rays. This functionality was integrated into an existing zero-footprint web-based DICOM viewer, and a dynamic HTML page was created to specify case generation parameters.<h4>Results</h4>The result is an easily accessible platform-agnostic web application available at: https://castlemountain.dk/mulrecon/perceptionTrainer.html.The application allows the user to specify the characteristics of lung nodules to be inserted into chest X-rays, and it produces automated feedback regarding nodule detection performance. Generated cases can be shared through a uniform resource locator.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We anticipate that the description and availability of our developed solution with open-sourced codes may help facilitate radiological education and stimulate the development of similar AI-augmented educational tools.<h4>Advances in knowledge</h4>A web-based application applying AI-based techniques for radiological perception training was developed.

It is cumbersome to view the prevalence of homologs for a protein of interest, or the gene neighborhoods of those homologs, across the diversity of the prokaryotes. We developed a web-based tool, fast.genomics, that uses two strategies to support fast browsing across the diversity of prokaryotes. First, the database of genomes is split up. The main database contains one representative from each of the 6,377 genera that have a high-quality genome, and additional databases for each taxonomic order contain up to 10 representatives of each species. Second, homologs of proteins of interest are identified quickly by using accelerated searches, usually in a few seconds. Once homologs are identified, fast.genomics can quickly show their prevalence across taxa, view their neighboring genes, or compare the prevalence of two different proteins.

Protein abundance, turnover, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are key factors that determine tissue-specific proteome properties. However, these properties are challenging to study across tissues and remain poorly understood. Here, we present Turnover-PPT, a comprehensive resource mapping the abundance and lifetime of 11,000 proteins and 40,000 phosphosites in eight mouse tissues and various brain regions using advanced proteomics and stable isotope labeling. We reveal tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, strong correlations between interacting protein lifetimes, and distinct impacts of phosphorylation on protein turnover. Notably, we discover a remarkable pattern of turnover changes for peroxisome proteins in specific tissues and that phosphorylation regulates the stability of neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau and α-synuclein.

Without unified federal guidance, states have been the front lines of the policy response.<h4>Main text</h4>We created the COVID-19 US State Policy (CUSP) database ( https://statepolicies.com/ ) to document the dates and components of economic relief and public health measures issued at the state level in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Documented interventions included school and business closures, face mask mandates, directives on vaccine eligibility, eviction moratoria, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits. By providing continually updated information, CUSP was designed to inform rapid-response, policy-relevant research in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been widely used to investigate the impact of state policies on population health and health equity. This paper introduces the CUSP database and highlights how it is already informing the COVID-19 pandemic response in the US.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CUSP is the most comprehensive publicly available policy database of health, social, and economic policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.

35390003,Predicted mouse interactome and network-based interpretation of differentially expressed genes.,"The house mouse or Mus musculus has become a premier mammalian model for genetic research due to its genetic and physiological similarities to humans. It brought mechanistic insights into numerous human diseases and has been routinely used to assess drug efficiency and toxicity, as well as to predict patient responses. To facilitate molecular mechanism studies in mouse, we present the Mouse Interactome Database (MID, Version 1), which includes 155,887 putative functional associations between mouse protein-coding genes inferred from functional association evidence integrated from 9 public databases. These putative functional associations are expected to cover 19.32% of all mouse protein interactions, and 26.02% of these function associations may represent protein interactions. On top of MID, we developed a gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) web tool to annotate potential functional impacts from observed differentially expressed genes.

We then construct a digitalized genotyping CNVb map across 1599 global wheat accessions. Key CNVb markers are linked with trait-associated introgressions, such as the 1RS·1BL translocation and 2N<sup>v</sup>S translocation, and the beneficial alleles, such as the end-use quality allele Glu-D1d (Dx5 + Dy10) and the semi-dwarf r-e-z allele. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these tagged CNVb markers promote a stable and cost-effective strategy for evaluating wheat germplasm resources with ultra-low-coverage sequencing data, competing with SNP array for applications such as evaluating new varieties, efficient management of collections in gene banks, and describing wheat germplasm resources in a digitalized manner. We also develop a user-friendly interactive platform, WheatCNVb ( http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/WheatCNVb/ ), for exploring the CNVb profiles over ever-increasing wheat accessions, and also propose a QR-code-like representation of individual digital CNVb fingerprint.

35183229,Additional insights into the organization of transcriptional regulatory modules based on a 3D model of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Transcriptional regulatory modules are usually modelled via a network, in which nodes correspond to genes and edges correspond to regulatory associations between them. In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the topological properties of such a network are well-described (distribution of degrees, hierarchical levels, organization in network motifs, etc.). To go further on this, our aim was to search for additional information resulting from the new combination of classical representations of transcriptional regulatory networks with more realistic models of the spatial organization of S. cerevisiae genome in the nucleus.<h4>Results</h4>Taking advantage of independent studies with high-quality datasets, i.e. lists of target genes for specific transcription factors and chromosome positions in a three dimensional space representing the nucleus, particular spatial co-localizations of genes that shared common regulatory mechanisms were searched. All transcriptional modules of S. cerevisiae, as described in the latest release of the YEASTRACT database were analyzed and significant biases toward co-localization for a few sets of target genes were observed.

In this study, we undertook an exhaustive review of the advancements in our understanding of plant flowering genes. We delved into the identification and conducted comparative analyses of flowering genes across virtually all sequenced angiosperm plant genomes. Furthermore, we established an extensive angiosperm flowering atlas, encompassing a staggering 183 720 genes across eight pathways, along with 10 155 ABCDE mode genes, which play a pivotal role in plant flowering regulation. Through the examination of expression patterns, we unveiled the specificities of these flowering genes. An interaction network between flowering genes of the ABCDE model and their corresponding upstream genes offered a blueprint for comprehending their regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, we predicted the miRNA and target genes linked to the flowering processes of each species.

Here we generated the transcriptomic Cell Atlas of Worm Aging (CAWA, http://mengwanglab.org/atlas ) of wild-type and long-lived strains. We discovered cell-specific, age-related molecular and functional signatures across all somatic and germ cell types. We developed transcriptomic aging clocks for different tissues and quantitatively determined how three different pro-longevity strategies slow tissue aging distinctively. Furthermore, through genome-wide profiling of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in different tissues, we discovered cell-type-specific APA changes during aging and revealed how these changes are differentially affected by the pro-longevity strategies.

To facilitate improved management of GCs, protein biomarkers have been identified through mass spectrometry-based proteomics platforms. In order to exhibit clinical utility of such data, we congregated over 6800 differentially regulated proteins in GCs from proteomics studies and recorded the mass spectrometry platforms, association of the protein with infectious agents, protein identifiers, sample size and clinical characters of samples used with details on validation. Development of targeted proteomics methods is the cornerstone for pursuing these markers into clinical utility. Therefore, we developed Protein Biomarker Matrix for Gastric Cancer (PBMGC), a simple catalogue of robustness of each protein. This analysis yielded the identification of robust tissue, serum, and urine diagnostic and prognostic protein biomarker panels which can be further tested for their clinical utility. We also ascertained proteotypic tryptic peptides of 5631 proteins suitable for developing multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays. Extensive characterization of these peptides was carried out to record peptide ions, mass/charge and enhanced specific peptide features.

36964722,Fast and accurate protein function prediction from sequence through pretrained language model and homology-based label diffusion.,"Protein function prediction is an essential task in bioinformatics which benefits disease mechanism elucidation and drug target discovery. Due to the explosive growth of proteins in sequence databases and the diversity of their functions, it remains challenging to fast and accurately predict protein functions from sequences alone. Although many methods have integrated protein structures, biological networks or literature information to improve performance, these extra features are often unavailable for most proteins. Here, we propose SPROF-GO, a Sequence-based alignment-free PROtein Function predictor, which leverages a pretrained language model to efficiently extract informative sequence embeddings and employs self-attention pooling to focus on important residues. The prediction is further advanced by exploiting the homology information and accounting for the overlapping communities of proteins with related functions through the label diffusion algorithm. SPROF-GO was shown to surpass state-of-the-art sequence-based and even network-based approaches by more than 14.5, 27.3 and 10.1% in area under the precision-recall curve on the three sub-ontology test sets, respectively. Our method was also demonstrated to generalize well on non-homologous proteins and unseen species. Finally, visualization based on the attention mechanism indicated that SPROF-GO is able to capture sequence domains useful for function prediction. The datasets, source codes and trained models of SPROF-GO are available at https://github.com/biomed-AI/SPROF-GO.

Many existing studies have reported causal associations among drugs, gut microbes, or diseases, calling for a workflow to reveal their intricate interactions. In this study, we developed a systematic workflow comprising three modules to construct a Quorum Sensing-based Drug-Microbe-Disease (QS-DMD) database ( http://www.qsdmd.lbci.net/ ), which includes diverse interactions for more than 8,000 drugs, 163 microbes, and 42 common diseases. Potential interactions between microbes and more than 8,000 drugs have been systematically studied by targeting microbial QS receptors combined with a docking-based virtual screening technique and in vitro experimental validations. Furthermore, we have constructed a QS-based drug-receptor interaction network, proposed a systematic framework including various drug-receptor-microbe-disease connections, and mapped a paradigmatic circular interaction network based on the QS-DMD, which can provide the underlying QS-based mechanisms for the reported causal associations.

36894999,A crowdsourcing database for the copy-number variation of the Spanish population.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite being a very common type of genetic variation, the distribution of copy-number variations (CNVs) in the population is still poorly understood. The knowledge of the genetic variability, especially at the level of the local population, is a critical factor for distinguishing pathogenic from non-pathogenic variation in the discovery of new disease variants.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the SPAnish Copy Number Alterations Collaborative Server (SPACNACS), which currently contains copy number variation profiles obtained from more than 400 genomes and exomes of unrelated Spanish individuals. By means of a collaborative crowdsourcing effort whole genome and whole exome sequencing data, produced by local genomic projects and for other purposes, is continuously collected. Once checked both, the Spanish ancestry and the lack of kinship with other individuals in the SPACNACS, the CNVs are inferred for these sequences and they are used to populate the database. A web interface allows querying the database with different filters that include ICD10 upper categories.

38834718,A novel framework based on explainable AI and genetic algorithms for designing neurological medicines.,"The advent of the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by artificial intelligence (AI) as its central component, has resulted in the mechanization of numerous previously labor-intensive activities. The use of in silico tools has become prevalent in the design of biopharmaceuticals. Upon conducting a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of many organisms, it has been discovered that their tissues can generate specific peptides that confer protection against certain diseases. This study aims to identify a selected group of neuropeptides (NPs) possessing favorable characteristics that render them ideal for production as neurological biopharmaceuticals. Until now, the construction of NP classifiers has been the primary focus, neglecting to optimize these characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the task of creating ideal NPs has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed framework, NPpred, comprises two distinct components: NSGA-NeuroPred and BERT-NeuroPred. The former employs the NSGA-II algorithm to explore and change a population of NPs, while the latter is an interpretable deep learning-based model. The utilization of explainable AI and motifs has led to the proposal of two novel operators, namely p-crossover and p-mutation.

In order to understand the role of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the regulation of seed development, we carried out computational analysis using transcriptome data of developing seeds of two contrasting genotypes of B. juncea, Pusajaikisan (PJK) and Early Heera 2 (EH2). The seeds were sampled at three stages, 15, 30, and 45 days after pollination. We identified 1,539 lncRNAs, of which 809 were differentially expressed. We also carried out extensive characterization and functional analysis of seed lncRNAome. The expression patterns were analysed using k-means clustering, and the targets were analysed using pathway, transcription factor, and GO enrichment, as well as ortholog information. We shortlisted a total of 25 robust lncRNA candidates for seed size, oil content, and seed coat color. We also identified 4 lncRNAs as putative precursors of miRNAs regulating seed development. Moreover, a total of 28 miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA regulatory networks regulating seed traits were identified. We also developed a comprehensive database, (BrassIca juncea database or ""BIJ"" ( https://bij.cuh.ac.in/ ), which provides seed omics as well as other functional genomics and genetics data in an easily accessible form.

39658207,Augmenting small biomedical datasets using generative AI methods based on self-organizing neural networks.,"Small sample sizes in biomedical research often led to poor reproducibility and challenges in translating findings into clinical applications. This problem stems from limited study resources, rare diseases, ethical considerations in animal studies, costly expert diagnosis, and others. As a contribution to the problem, we propose a novel generative algorithm based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) to computationally increase sample sizes. The proposed unsupervised generative algorithm uses neural networks to detect inherent structure even in small multivariate datasets, distinguishing between sparse ""void"" and dense ""cloud"" regions. Using emergent SOMs (ESOMs), the algorithm adapts to high-dimensional data structures and generates for each original data point k new points by randomly selecting positions within an adapted hypersphere with distances based on valid neighborhood probabilities. Experiments on artificial and biomedical (omics) datasets show that the generated data preserve the original structure without introducing artifacts. Random forests and support vector machines cannot distinguish between generated and original data, and the variables of original and generated data sets are not statistically different. The method successfully augments small group sizes, such as transcriptomics data from a rare form of leukemia and lipidomics data from arthritis research. The novel ESOM-based generative algorithm presents a promising solution for enhancing sample sizes in small or rare case datasets, even when limited training data are available. This approach can address challenges associated with small sample sizes in biomedical research, offering a tool for improving the reliability and robustness of scientific findings in this field.

Knowledge of these effects not only facilitates space agricultural and biopharmaceutical technology development but also provides unique perspectives to ground-based investigations. SLIs are specialized experimental protocols and notable biological phenomena. These require specialized databases, leading to the development of the NASA Science Data Archive, Erasmus Experiment Archive, and NASA GeneLab. The increasing interests of SLIs across diverse fields demand resources with comprehensive content, convenient search facilities, and friendly information presentation. A new database SpaceLID (Space Life Investigation Database http://bidd.group/spacelid/ ) was developed with detailed menu search tools and categorized contents about the phenomena, protocols, and outcomes of 459 SLIs (including 106 plant investigations) of 92 species, where 236 SLIs and 57 plant investigations are uncovered by the existing databases. The usefulness of SpaceLID as an SLI information source is illustrated by the literature-reported analysis of metabolite, nutrition, and symbiosis variations of spaceflight plants. In conclusion, this study extensively investigated the impact of the space environment on plant biology, utilizing SpaceLID as an information source and examining various plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica rapa L., and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.

35758882,A transcriptome atlas and interactive analysis platform for autoimmune disease.,"With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technology, many laboratories have produced a large amount of single-cell transcriptome data of blood and tissue samples from patients with autoimmune diseases, which enables in-depth studies of the relationship between gene transcription and autoimmune diseases. However, there is still a lack of a database that integrates the large amount of autoimmune disease transcriptome sequencing data and conducts effective analysis. In this study, we developed a user-friendly web database tool, Interactive Analysis and Atlas for Autoimmune disease (IAAA), which integrates bulk RNA-seq data of 929 samples of 10 autoimmune diseases and single-cell RNA-seq data of 783 203 cells in 96 samples of 6 autoimmune diseases. IAAA also provides customizable analysis modules, including gene expression, difference, correlation, similar gene detection and cell-cell interaction, and can display results in three formats (plot, table and pdf) through custom parameters.

38367620,Alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait methylation mapping in human cancers provides clues into the molecular mechanisms of APA.,"Genetic variants are involved in the orchestration of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events, while the role of DNA methylation in regulating APA remains unclear. We generated a comprehensive atlas of APA quantitative trait methylation sites (apaQTMs) across 21 different types of cancer (1,612 to 60,219 acting in cis and 4,448 to 142,349 in trans). Potential causal apaQTMs in non-cancer samples were also identified. Mechanistically, we observed a strong enrichment of cis-apaQTMs near polyadenylation sites (PASs) and both cis- and trans-apaQTMs in proximity to transcription factor (TF) binding regions. Through the integration of ChIP-signals and RNA-seq data from cell lines, we have identified several regulators of APA events, acting either directly or indirectly, implicating novel functions of some important genes, such as TCF7L2, which is known for its involvement in type 2 diabetes and cancers. Furthermore, we have identified a vast number of QTMs that share the same putative causal CpG sites with five different cancer types, underscoring the roles of QTMs, including apaQTMs, in the process of tumorigenesis. DNA methylation is extensively involved in the regulation of APA events in human cancers. In an attempt to elucidate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms of APA by DNA methylation, our study paves the way for subsequent experimental validations into the intricate biological functions of DNA methylation in APA regulation and the pathogenesis of human cancers.

Binarization plays an important role in quantitative analysis of eye with optical coherence tomography. To address the problem of few training samples and contrast-limited scene, we proposed a new binarization framework with specific-patch SVM (SPSVM) for low-intensity OCT image, which is open and classification-based framework. This new framework contains two phases: training model and binarization threshold. In the training phase, firstly, the patches of target and background from few training samples are extracted as the ROI and the background, respectively. Then, PCA is conducted on all patches to reduce the dimension and learn the eigenvector subspace. Finally, the classification model is trained from the features of patches to get the target value of different patches. In the testing phase, the learned eigenvector subspace is conducted on the pixels of each patch. The binarization threshold of patch is obtained with the learned SVM model.

Using representation learning algorithms, we derived two components of this resource: GBM-CoRegNet, a highly specific coregulatory network of tumor cells, and GBM-CoRegMap, a unified network influence map based on 1612 tumors from 16 studies. As a widely applicable closed-loop system connecting cellular models and tumors, GBM-cRegMap will provide the GBM research community with an easy-to-use web tool ( https://gbm.cregmap.com ) that maps any existing or newly generated transcriptomic ""query"" data to a reference coregulatory network and a large-scale manifold of disease heterogeneity. Using GBM-cRegMap, we demonstrated the synergy between the two components by refining the molecular classification of GBM, identifying potential key regulators, and aligning the transcriptional profiles of tumors and in vitro models. Through the amalgamation of a vast dataset, we validated the proneural (PN)-mesenchymal (MES) axis and identified three subclasses of classical (CL) tumors: astrocyte-like (CL-A), epithelial basal-like (CL-B), and cilium-rich (CL-C). We revealed the CL-C subclass, an intermediate state demonstrating the plasticity of GBM cells along the PN-MES axis under chemotherapy.

37033061,Using machine learning to predict lymph node metastasis in patients with renal cell carcinoma: A population-based study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lymph node (LN) metastasis is strongly associated with distant metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and indicates an adverse prognosis. Accurate LN-status prediction is essential for individualized treatment of patients with RCC and to help physicians make appropriate surgical decisions. Thus, a prediction model to assess the hazard index of LN metastasis in patients with RCC is needed.<h4>Methods</h4>Partial data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Data of 492 individuals with RCC, collected from the Southwest Hospital in Chongqing, China, were used for external validation. Eight indicators of risk of LN metastasis were screened out. Six machine learning (ML) classifiers were established and tuned, focused on predicting LN metastasis in patients with RCC. The models were integrated with big data analytics and ML algorithms. Based on the optimal model, we developed an online risk calculator and plotted overall survival using Kaplan-Meier analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The extreme gradient-boosting (XGB) model was superior to the other models in both internal and external trials. The area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.930, 0.857, 0.856, and 0.873, respectively, in the internal test and 0.958, 0.935, 0.769, and 0.944, respectively, in the external test. These parameters show that XGB has an excellent ability for clinical application. The survival analysis showed that patients with predicted N1 tumors had significantly shorter survival (<i>p</i> < 0.0001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study shows that integrating ML algorithms and clinical data can effectively predict LN metastasis in patients with confirmed RCC.

35508965,A database for retrieving information on SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations based on correlation network analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Over a million genomes and mutational analyses of SARS-CoV-2 are available in public databases, which reveal the phylogenetic tree of the virus. Although these data have enabled scientists to closely track the evolution and transmission dynamics of the virus at global and local scales, the Mu variant, recently identified in infections in South America, shows an unusual combination of mutations, and it is difficult to visualize these atypical characteristics in public databases based on a phylogenetic tree.<h4>Results</h4>The Vcorn SARS-CoV-2 database was constructed to provide information on COVID-19 infections and mutations in the S protein of the virus based on correlation network analysis. A correlation network was constructed using the recall index of one mutation to another mutation. The network includes several network modules in which nodes represent mutations and are tightly connected to each other. Individual network modules contain mutations of single variants, such as the alpha and delta variants. In the network constructed to emphasize mutations of the Mu variant using the database, the mutations were found to be located in multiple network modules, indicating that the mutations of the variant may have originated from multiple variants or be located at a basal position with a high frequency of mutation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Vcorn SARS-CoV-2 provides information on COVID-19 and S protein mutations of SARS-CoV-2 via correlation network analysis.

36707040,Revisiting the Ramachandran plot based on statistical analysis of static and dynamic characteristics of protein structures.,"Ramachandran plots, which describe protein structures by plotting the dihedral angle pairs of the backbone on a two-dimensional plane, have played an important role in structural biology over the past few decades. However, despite continued discovery of new protein structures to date, the Ramachandran plot is still constructed by only a small number of data points, and further it cannot reflect the steric information of proteins. Here, we investigated the secondary structure of proteins in terms of static and dynamic characteristics. As for static feature, the Ramachandran plot was revisited for the dataset consisting of 9,148 non-redundant high-resolution protein structures released in the protein data bank until April 1, 2022. By calculating amino acid propensities, it was found that the proportion of secondary structures with respect to residue depth is directly related to their hydrophobicity. As for dynamic feature, normal mode analysis (NMA) based on an elastic network model (ENM) was carried out for the dataset using our KOSMOS web server (http://bioengineering.skku.ac.kr/kosmos/). All ENM-based NMA results were stored in the KOSMOS database, allowing researchers to use them in various ways. In this process, it was commonly found that high B-factors appeared at the edge of the alpha helix region, which was elucidated by introducing residue depth. In addition, by investigating the change in dihedral angle, it was possible to quantitatively survey the contribution of structural change of protein on the Ramachandran plot.

36920090,Inter-domain distance prediction based on deep learning for domain assembly.,"AlphaFold2 achieved a breakthrough in protein structure prediction through the end-to-end deep learning method, which can predict nearly all single-domain proteins at experimental resolution. However, the prediction accuracy of full-chain proteins is generally lower than that of single-domain proteins because of the incorrect interactions between domains. In this work, we develop an inter-domain distance prediction method, named DeepIDDP. In DeepIDDP, we design a neural network with attention mechanisms, where two new inter-domain features are used to enhance the ability to capture the interactions between domains. Furthermore, we propose a data enhancement strategy termed DPMSA, which is employed to deal with the absence of co-evolutionary information on targets. We integrate DeepIDDP into our previously developed domain assembly method SADA, termed SADA-DeepIDDP. Tested on a given multi-domain benchmark dataset, the accuracy of SADA-DeepIDDP inter-domain distance prediction is 11.3% and 21.6% higher than trRosettaX and trRosetta, respectively. The accuracy of the domain assembly model is 2.5% higher than that of SADA. Meanwhile, we reassemble 68 human multi-domain protein models with TM-score ≤ 0.80 from the AlphaFold protein structure database, where the average TM-score is improved by 11.8% after the reassembly by our method.

39937662,Building resource-efficient community databases using open-source software.,"The unprecedented volume of big data being routinely generated for nonmodel crop species, coupled with advanced technology enabling the use of big data in breeding, gives further impetus for the need to have access to crop community databases, where all relevant data are curated and integrated. Funding for such databases is, however, insufficient and intermittent, resulting in the data being underutilized. While increased awareness of the importance of funding databases is important, it is practically necessary to find a more efficient way to build a community database. To meet the need for integrated database resources for various crop genomics, genetics, and breeding research communities, we have built five crop databases over the last decade using an open-source database platform and software. We describe the system and methods used for database construction, curation, and analysis protocols, and the data and tools that are available in these five crop databases.

40860433,A Hiplot-based web service for cold atmospheric plasma high-throughput data integration and analysis on breast cancer.,"Incremental evidence on the effect of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in specifically killing transformed cells and advances in sequencing technologies at multiple omics have led to the demand of in-depth exploration on the mechanisms of action driving the potency of CAP against cancer cells at the molecular level. However, high-throughput data detailing the effect of CAP on cancer cells is lacking, let alone the corresponding database and analytical tool. Here, we sequenced the whole transcriptome, proteome, phosphorylome, acetylome, and lactylome of transformed cells in response to CAP using breast cancer cells as the disease model; and advanced our previously developed Hiplot platform by establishing a focus-driven tumor-specific module, namely CAP medicine in breast cancer (CAPmed-BC) (https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn). CAPmed-BC is the first multi-omics data resource in plasma medicine for analyzing the treatment response of breast cancer cells to CAP. It can analyze each type of omics data regarding differentially expressed biomarkers, expression landscape, gene ontology analysis, pathway interpretation, gene set enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network. It can also interrogate the dynamic fluctuation, functional activity, and metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells in response to CAP by combinatorially analyzing omics at multiple carefully defined dimensions. We also built in a visualization module to support users for producing personalized graphs via adjusting parameters. We believe that CAPmed-BC will become a valuable resource for characterizing the outcome of CAP on breast cancers at the omics and molecular levels, and make considerable contributions to both plasma medicine and oncology.",False,True,,0.70328873,cap medicine in breast,,6.67877084,ok,,capmed-bc,,v2,0.67877084,,False,0.0,False,False,https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn,https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn,True,...namely CAP medicine in breast cancer (CAPmed-BC) (https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn).

35810958,A web server for identifying circRNA-RBP variable-length binding sites based on stacked generalization ensemble deep learning network.,"Circular RNA (circRNA) can exert biological functions by interacting with RNA-binding protein (RBP), and some deep learning-based methods have been developed to predict RBP binding sites on circRNA. However, most of these methods identify circRNA-RBP binding sites are only based on single data resource and cannot provide exact binding sites, only providing the probability value of a sequence fragment. To solve these problems, we propose a binding sites localization algorithm that fuses binding sites from multiple databases, and further design a stacked generalization ensemble deep learning model named CirRBP to identify RBP binding sites on circRNA. The CirRBP is trained by combining the binding sites from multiple databases and makes predictions by weighted aggregating the predictions of each sub-model. The results show that the CirRBP outperforms any sub-model and existing online prediction model. For better access to our research results, we develop an open-source web application called CRWS (CircRNA-RBP Web Server). Its back-end learning model of the CRWS is a stacked generalization ensemble learning model CirRBP based on different deep learning frameworks. Given a full-length circRNA or fragment sequence and a target RBP, the CRWS can analyze and provide the exact potential binding sites of the target RBP on the given sequence through the binding sites localization algorithm, and visualize it. In addition, the CRWS can discover the most widely distributed motif in each RBP dataset. Up to now, CRWS is the first significant online tool that uses multi-source data to train models and predict exact binding sites.

35294761,High-Throughput Screening Assay Profiling for Large Chemical Databases.,"High-throughput screening (HTS) techniques are increasingly being adopted by a variety of fields of toxicology. Notably, large-scale research efforts from government, industrial, and academic laboratories are screening millions of chemicals against a variety of biomolecular targets, producing an enormous amount of publicly available HTS assay data. These HTS assay data provide toxicologists important information on how chemicals interact with different biomolecular targets and provide illustrations of potential toxicity mechanisms. Open public data repositories, such as the National Institutes of Health's PubChem ( http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), were established to accept, store, and share HTS data. Through the PubChem website, users can rapidly obtain the PubChem assay results for compounds by using different chemical identifiers (including SMILES, InChIKey, IUPAC names, etc.). However, obtaining these data in a user-friendly format suitable for modeling and other informatics analysis (e.g., gathering PubChem data for hundreds or thousands of chemicals in a modeling friendly format) directly through the PubChem web portal is not feasible. This chapter aims to introduce two approaches to obtain the HTS assay results for large datasets of compounds from the PubChem portal. First, programmatic access via PubChem's PUG-REST web service using the Python programming language will be described. Second, most users, who lack programming skills, can directly obtain PubChem data for a large set of compounds by using the freely available Chemical In vitro-In vivo Profiling (CIIPro) portal ( http://www.ciipro.rutgers.edu ).",True,False,3.5,,in vitro-in vivo profiling,,6.6710485,ok,,pubchem,pug-rest | ciipro,v2,0.6710485,,True,5.0,False,False,http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov | http://www.ciipro.rutgers.edu,http://www.ciipro.rutgers.edu,True,...ical In vitro-In vivo Profiling (CIIPro) portal ( http://www.ciipro.rutgers.edu ).,1

35042860,A neural network-based method for exhaustive cell label assignment using single cell RNA-seq data.,"The fast-advancing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to study the transcriptome of heterogeneous tissues at a single cell level. The initial important step of analyzing scRNA-seq data is usually to accurately annotate cells. The traditional approach of annotating cell types based on unsupervised clustering and marker genes is time-consuming and laborious. Taking advantage of the numerous existing scRNA-seq databases, many supervised label assignment methods have been developed. One feature that many label assignment methods shares is to label cells with low confidence as ""unassigned."" These unassigned cells can be the result of assignment difficulties due to highly similar cell types or caused by the presence of unknown cell types. However, when unknown cell types are not expected, existing methods still label a considerable number of cells as unassigned, which is not desirable. In this work, we develop a neural network-based cell annotation method called NeuCA (Neural network-based Cell Annotation) for scRNA-seq data obtained from well-studied tissues. NeuCA can utilize the hierarchical structure information of the cell types to improve the annotation accuracy, which is especially helpful when data contain closely correlated cell types. We show that NeuCA can achieve more accurate cell annotation results compared with existing methods. Additionally, the applications on eight real datasets show that NeuCA has stable performance for intra- and inter-study annotation, as well as cross-condition annotation.

However, these data may not be easily accessible or usable by many researchers. To enhance data reuse, we present well-annotated, partially analyzed data via a user-friendly web application. This project involved transcriptome profiling of blood samples from 15 healthy pregnant women in a low-resource setting, taken at 6 consecutive time points beginning from the first trimester. Additional blood transcriptome profiles were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository, representing a cohort of healthy pregnant women from a high-resource setting. We analyzed these datasets using the fixed BloodGen3 module repertoire. We deployed a web application, accessible at https://thejacksonlaboratory.shinyapps.io/BloodGen3_Pregnancy/which displays the module-level analysis results from both original and public pregnancy blood transcriptome datasets. Users can create custom fingerprint grid and heatmap representations via various navigation options, useful for reports and manuscript preparation.

Inbred rat strains control for genetic background and allow for repeated, reproducible, cellular and whole animal phenotyping. The Hybrid Rat Diversity Panel (HRDP) was designed to be a powerful panel of inbred rats with genomic, physiological, and behavioral data to serve as a resource for systems genetics. The HRDP consists of 96-98 inbred rat strains aimed to maximize power to detect specific genetic loci associated with complex traits while maximizing the genetic diversity among strains. The panel consists of 32-34 genetically diverse inbred strains and two panels of recombinant inbred panels. To establish the HRDP program, embryo resuscitation and breeding were done to establish colonies for distribution. Whole genome sequencing was performed to achieve 30X coverage.

36454444,A network map of discoidin domain receptor 1(DDR1)-mediated signaling in pathological conditions.,"Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is one of the receptors that belong to a family of non-integrin collagen receptors. In common, DDR1 is predominantly found in epithelial and smooth muscle cells and its mainly involved in organogenesis during embryonic development. However, it's also overexpressed in several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammation. The DDR1 is reported in numerous cancers, including breast, prostate, pancreatic, bladder, lung, liver, pituitary, colorectal, skin, gastric, glioblastoma, and inflammation. DDR1 activates through the collagen I, IV, IGF-1/IGF1R, and IGF2/IR, regulating downstream signaling molecules such as MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and NF-kB in diseases. Despite its biomedical importance, there is a lack of consolidated network map of the DDR1 signaling pathway, which prompted us for curation of literature data pertaining to the DDR1 system following the NetPath criteria. We present here the compiled pathway map comprises 39 activation/inhibition events, 17 catalysis events, 22 molecular associations, 65 gene regulation events, 35 types of protein expression, and two protein translocation events.

35962986,Structural analogue-based protein structure domain assembly assisted by deep learning.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the breakthrough of AlphaFold2, the protein structure prediction problem has made remarkable progress through deep learning end-to-end techniques, in which correct folds could be built for nearly all single-domain proteins. However, the full-chain modelling appears to be lower on average accuracy than that for the constituent domains and requires higher demand on computing hardware, indicating the performance of full-chain modelling still needs to be improved. In this study, we investigate whether the predicted accuracy of the full-chain model can be further improved by domain assembly assisted by deep learning.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we developed a structural analogue-based protein structure domain assembly method assisted by deep learning, named SADA. In SADA, a multi-domain protein structure database was constructed for the full-chain analogue detection using individual domain models. Starting from the initial model constructed from the analogue, the domain assembly simulation was performed to generate the full-chain model through a two-stage differential evolution algorithm guided by the energy function with an inter-residue distance potential predicted by deep learning. SADA was compared with the state-of-the-art domain assembly methods on 356 benchmark proteins, and the average TM-score of SADA models is 8.1% and 27.0% higher than that of DEMO and AIDA, respectively. We also assembled 293 human multi-domain proteins, where the average TM-score of the full-chain model after the assembly by SADA is 1.1% higher than that of the model by AlphaFold2. To conclude, we find that the domains often interact in the similar way in the quaternary orientations if the domains have similar tertiary structures. Furthermore, homologous templates and structural analogues are complementary for multi-domain protein full-chain modelling.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/SADA.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,3.5,,sada.<h4,sada | demo | aida,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/SADA,http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/SADA,True,...modelling.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://zhanglab-bioinf.com/SADA.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1

Specifically, previous work has demonstrated that structural features of tissue and drug-treated cell line samples can be used to predict tissue type and characterize drug relationships, respectively. We have developed structural signatures, a web server for annotating and analyzing protein features from gene sets that are often found in transcriptomic and proteomic data. This platform provides access to a structural feature database derived from normal and disease human tissue samples. We show how analysis using this database can shed light on the relationship between states of single-cell RNA-sequencing lung cancer samples.

36340350,Transcriptomic and metabolomic integration as a resource in grapevine to study fruit metabolite quality traits.,"Transcriptomics and metabolomics are methodologies being increasingly chosen to perform molecular studies in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), focusing either on plant and fruit development or on interaction with abiotic or biotic factors. Currently, the integration of these approaches has become of utmost relevance when studying key plant physiological and metabolic processes. The results from these analyses can undoubtedly be incorporated in breeding programs whereby genes associated with better fruit quality (e.g., those enhancing the accumulation of health-promoting compounds) or with stress resistance (e.g., those regulating beneficial responses to environmental transition) can be used as selection markers in crop improvement programs. Despite the vast amount of data being generated, integrative transcriptome/metabolome meta-analyses (i.e., the joint analysis of several studies) have not yet been fully accomplished in this species, mainly due to particular specificities of metabolomic studies, such as differences in data acquisition (i.e., different compounds being investigated), unappropriated and unstandardized metadata, or simply no deposition of data in public repositories. These meta-analyses require a high computational capacity for data mining <i>a priori</i>, but they also need appropriate tools to explore and visualize the integrated results. This perspective article explores the universe of omics studies conducted in <i>V. vinifera</i>, focusing on fruit-transcriptome and metabolome analyses as leading approaches to understand berry physiology, secondary metabolism, and quality. Moreover, we show how omics data can be integrated in a simple format and offered to the research community as a web resource, giving the chance to inspect potential gene-<i>to</i>-gene and gene-<i>to</i>-metabolite relationships that can later be tested in hypothesis-driven research.

40157887,An automatic annotation tool and reference database for T cell subtypes and states at single-cell resolution.,"T cells have various subtypes and states with different functions. However, a reference list and automated annotation tool for T cell subtypes and states are lacking, which is critical for analyzing and comparing T cells under various conditions. We constructed the largest human T cell reference, containing 1,348,268 T cells from 35 conditions and 16 tissues. We classified T cells into 33 subtypes and further stratified them into 68 categories according to subtype and state. Based on this reference, we developed a tool named STCAT to automatically annotate T cells from scRNA-seq data by hierarchical models and marker correction. The accuracy of STCAT was 28% higher than that of existing tools validated on six independent datasets, including cancer and healthy samples. Using STCAT, we consistently discovered that CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells were enriched in late-stage lung cancer patients in multiple datasets, whereas MAIT cells were prevalent in milder-stage COVID-19 patients. We also confirmed a decrease in Treg cytotoxicity in post-treatment ovarian cancer. Systematic landscape analyses of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell references revealed that CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells were enriched in tumor samples and that CD8<sup>+</sup> naive-related cells were abundant in healthy individuals. Finally, we deposited all the T cell references and annotations into a TCellAtlas (https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCellAtlas) database, which allows users to browse T cell expression profiles and analyze customized scRNA-seq data by STCAT.

38504112,Enriched atlas of lncRNA and protein-coding genes for the GRCg7b chicken assembly and its functional annotation across 47 tissues.,"Gene atlases for livestock are steadily improving thanks to new genome assemblies and new expression data improving the gene annotation. However, gene content varies across databases due to differences in RNA sequencing data and bioinformatics pipelines, especially for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which have higher tissue and developmental specificity and are harder to consistently identify compared to protein coding genes (PCGs). As done previously in 2020 for chicken assemblies galgal5 and GRCg6a, we provide a new gene atlas, lncRNA-enriched, for the latest GRCg7b chicken assembly, integrating ""NCBI RefSeq"", ""EMBL-EBI Ensembl/GENCODE"" reference annotations and other resources such as FAANG and NONCODE. As a result, the number of PCGs increases from 18,022 (RefSeq) and 17,007 (Ensembl) to 24,102, and that of lncRNAs from 5789 (RefSeq) and 11,944 (Ensembl) to 44,428. Using 1400 public RNA-seq transcriptome representing 47 tissues, we provided expression evidence for 35,257 (79%) lncRNAs and 22,468 (93%) PCGs, supporting the relevance of this atlas.

36571479,Tracing weak neuron fibers.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Precise reconstruction of neuronal arbors is important for circuitry mapping. Many auto-tracing algorithms have been developed toward full reconstruction. However, it is still challenging to trace the weak signals of neurite fibers that often correspond to axons.<h4>Results</h4>We proposed a method, named the NeuMiner, for tracing weak fibers by combining two strategies: an online sample mining strategy and a modified gamma transformation. NeuMiner improved the recall of weak signals (voxel values <20) by a large margin, from 5.1 to 27.8%. This is prominent for axons, which increased by 6.4 times, compared to 2.0 times for dendrites. Both strategies were shown to be beneficial for weak fiber recognition, and they reduced the average axonal spatial distances to gold standards by 46 and 13%, respectively. The improvement was observed on two prevalent automatic tracing algorithms and can be applied to any other tracers and image types.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source codes of NeuMiner are freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/crazylyf/neuronet/tree/semantic_fnm). Image visualization, preprocessing and tracing are conducted on the Vaa3D platform, which is accessible at the Vaa3D GitHub repository (https://github.com/Vaa3D).

37620325,Next-generation proteomics for quantitative Jumbophage-bacteria interaction mapping.,"Host-pathogen interactions are pivotal in regulating establishment, progression, and outcome of an infection. While affinity-purification mass spectrometry has become instrumental in characterizing such interactions, it suffers from limitations in scalability and biological authenticity. Here we present the use of co-fractionation mass spectrometry for high throughput analysis of host-pathogen interactions from native viral infections of two jumbophages (ϕKZ and ϕPA3) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This approach enabled the detection of > 6000 unique host-pathogen interactions for each phage, encompassing > 50% of their respective proteomes. This deep coverage provided evidence for interactions between KZ-like phage proteins and the host ribosome, and revealed protein complexes for previously undescribed phage ORFs, including a ϕPA3 complex showing strong structural and sequence similarity to ϕKZ non-virion RNA polymerase.

39538127,Harnessing full-text publications for deep insights into C. elegans and Drosophila biomaps.,"In the rapidly expanding domain of scientific research, tracking and synthesizing information from the rapidly increasing volume of publications pose significant challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel high-throughput pipeline that employs ChatGPT to systematically extract and analyze connectivity information from the full-texts and abstracts of 24,237 and 150,538 research publications concerning Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively. This approach has effectively identified 200,219 and 1,194,587 interactions within the C. elegans and Drosophila biomaps, respectively. Utilizing Cytoscape Web, we have developed a searchable online biomaps that link relevant keywords to their corresponding PubMed IDs, thus providing seamless access to an extensive knowledge network encompassing C. elegans and Drosophila. Our work highlights the transformative potential of integrating artificial intelligence with bioinformatics to deepen our understanding of complex biological systems. By revealing the intricate web of relationships among key entities in C. elegans and Drosophila, we offer invaluable insights that promise to propel advancements in genetics, developmental biology, neuroscience, longevity, and beyond. We also provide details and discuss significant nodes within both biomaps, including the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and the notch pathways.

40996715,"A new database of chestnut DNA fingerprints for genetic diversity assessment, precise varietal identification, and traceability.","The European chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill., Fagaceae) is ecologically and economically important, particularly in countries like Italy, Greece, Spain, and Turkey, where it supports rural economies and ecosystems. Accurate varietal recognition is crucial for managing chestnut groves but is hindered by the limitations of traditional methods, which require costly expertise and struggle to identify young, dormant, or scion trees. Recent advances in molecular tools, particularly single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identified through Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) technology, have transformed cultivar identification. To harness this potential, we developed KASTRACKdb, a genetic fingerprinting database for European chestnut that now integrates genotypic and phenotypic data for 150 chestnut accessions. Designed to translate KASP analysis results into practical and actionable insights, KASTRACKdb serves as a powerful tool for cultivar identification and management. The database offers three primary query modes and is designed for continuous upgrades, serving a crucial role in cataloguing the genetic diversity of chestnut trees, characterized by broad geographic distributions and significant genetic variation. This diversity is critical for conservation and breeding programs, enabling precise varietal identification and traceability to protect intellectual property, verify authenticity, and support the commercialization of high-value cultivars.

40523076,A New Comprehensive Platform for Profile-Mode-Based Untargeted Metabolomics for Efficient Data Mining to Improve Compound Extraction and Identification.,"The profile mode of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) is commonly utilized in metabolomics for its ability to comprehensively retain compound information in mass spectra. However, current data-analysis methods have not been optimized for the entire profile-mode-based untargeted metabolomics. To address this issue, we developed a set of novel algorithms, including centroiding transformation, extracted ion chromatogram construction, and feature extraction. We integrated them into a new automatic data analysis platform, AntDAS-Profiler. The performance of these newly developed algorithms was demonstrated by distinguishing chrysanthemums from various production origins. Additionally, AntDAS-Profiler was comprehensively compared with several state-of-the-art tools such as MS-DIAL, XCMS, and MZmine. Results suggested that AntDAS-Profiler can provide researchers with a comprehensive solution for UHPLC-HRMS profile-mode-based metabolomics.

The World Health Organization has established technical guidelines for managing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pharmaceutical wastewater and solid waste. However, the scarcity of publicly available data on antimicrobial manufacturing processes impedes the development of effective mitigation strategies. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a comprehensive database documenting antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in actual wastewater and solid waste samples, primarily fermentation residues. Through systematic review methodology, we compiled data from extensive searches of English-language article databases, including Web of Science and PubMed. The database contains data from 270 distinct samples collected across 45 fermentation residue treatment systems and 46 wastewater treatment systems, derived from 70 published English-language articles spanning 2008 to 2024. In operational pharmaceutical facilities, antibiotic concentrations ranged from 82 to 1,663 mg/L in raw wastewater and from 1,000 to 10,182 mg/kg dry matter (DM) in antibiotic fermentation residues. Various treatment technologies demonstrated significant reductions in both antibiotic concentrations and ARG levels within wastes.

37230405,A novel gluten knowledge base of potential biomedical and health-related interactions extracted from the literature: Using machine learning and graph analysis methodologies to reconstruct the bibliome.,"<h4>Background</h4>In return for their nutritional properties and broad availability, cereal crops have been associated with different alimentary disorders and symptoms, with the majority of the responsibility being attributed to gluten. Therefore, the research of gluten-related literature data continues to be produced at ever-growing rates, driven in part by the recent exploratory studies that link gluten to non-traditional diseases and the popularity of gluten-free diets, making it increasingly difficult to access and analyse practical and structured information. In this sense, the accelerated discovery of novel advances in diagnosis and treatment, as well as exploratory studies, produce a favourable scenario for disinformation and misinformation.<h4>Objectives</h4>Aligned with, the European Union strategy ""Delivering on EU Food Safety and Nutrition in 2050″ which emphasizes the inextricable links between imbalanced diets, the increased exposure to unreliable sources of information and misleading information, and the increased dependency on reliable sources of information; this paper presents GlutKNOIS, a public and interactive literature-based database that reconstructs and represents the experimental biomedical knowledge extracted from the gluten-related literature. The developed platform includes different external database knowledge, bibliometrics statistics and social media discussion to propose a novel and enhanced way to search, visualise and analyse potential biomedical and health-related interactions in relation to the gluten domain.<h4>Methods</h4>For this purpose, the presented study applies a semi-supervised curation workflow that combines natural language processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, ontology-based normalization and integration approaches, named entity recognition methods, and graph knowledge reconstruction methodologies to process, classify, represent and analyse the experimental findings contained in the literature, which is also complemented by data from the social discussion.<h4>Results and conclusions</h4>In this sense, 5814 documents were manually annotated and 7424 were fully automatically processed to reconstruct the first online gluten-related knowledge database of evidenced health-related interactions that produce health or metabolic changes based on the literature. In addition, the automatic processing of the literature combined with the knowledge representation methodologies proposed has the potential to assist in the revision and analysis of years of gluten research.

39476302,"Development of a web-based tool for estimating individualized survival curves in glioblastoma using clinical, mRNA, and tumor microenvironment features with fusion techniques.","<h4>Objective</h4>Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most common brain tumors, is known for its low survival rates and poor treatment responses. This study aims to create a robust predictive model that integrates multiple feature types, including clinical data, RNA expression, and tumor microenvironment data, using fusion techniques to enhance model performance.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained data from the SEER database to assess the impact of nine demographic and clinical features on the survival of 58,495 GBM patients and built predictive machine learning models. Additionally, mRNA expression data from 600 GBM patients from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO were analyzed. We used Cox regression and LASSO to create a gene signature, which was compared against 13 published signatures for accuracy. Twenty-one machine learning models were applied to predict survival at multiple time points. Finally, we integrated multiple feature types using fusion techniques and developed a Shiny app to provide survival predictions for GBM patients.<h4>Results</h4>Using the SEER database, we constructed machine learning models based on nine clinical variables: age, gender, marital status, race, tumor site, laterality, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The best-performing model achieved AUC values of 0.775, 0.728, 0.692, and 0.683 for predicting survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in the testing cohort. In the merged TCGA, CGGA, and GEO cohorts, we identified 11 genes to develop predictive models. These 11 genes outperformed 13 other published gene signatures in predicting the prognosis of GBM.

38886537,A comprehensive whole genome database of ethnic minority populations.,"China, is characterized by its remarkable ethnical diversity, which necessitates whole genome variation data from multiple populations as crucial tools for advancing population genetics and precision medical research. However, there has been a scarcity of research concentrating on the whole genome of ethnic minority groups. To fill this gap, we developed the Guizhou Multi-ethnic Genome Database (GMGD). It comprises whole genome sequencing data from 476 healthy unrelated individuals spanning 11 ethnic minorities groups in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, including Bouyei, Dong, Miao, Yi, Bai, Gelo, Zhuang, Tujia, Yao, Hui, and Sui. The GMGD database comprises more than 16.33 million variants in GRCh38 and 16.20 million variants in GRCh37. Among these, approximately 11.9% (1,956,322) of the variants in GRCh38 and 18.5% (3,009,431) of the variants in GRCh37 are entirely new and do not exist in the dbSNP database. These novel variants shed light on the genetic diversity landscape across these populations, providing valuable insights with an average coverage of 5.5 ×. This makes GMGD the largest genome-wide database encompassing the most diverse ethnic groups to date. The GMGD interactive interface facilitates researchers with multi-dimensional mutation search methods and displays population frequency differences among global populations. Furthermore, GMGD is equipped with a genotype-imputation function, enabling enhanced capabilities for low-depth genomic research or targeted region capture studies.

32070994,A Refined 3-in-1 Fused Protein Similarity Measure: Application in Threshold-Free Hub Detection.,"An exhaustive literature survey shows that finding protein/gene similarity is an important step towards solving widespread bioinformatics problems, such as predicting protein-protein interactions, analyzing Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPINs), gene prioritization, and disease gene/protein detection. In this article, we have proposed an improved 3-in-1 fused protein similarity measure called FuSim-II. It is built upon combining the weighted average of biological knowledge extracted from three potential genomic/ proteomic resources such as Gene Ontology (GO), PPIN, and protein sequence. Furthermore, we have shown the application of the proposed measure in detecting potential hub-proteins from a given PPIN. Aiming that, we have proposed a multi-objective clustering-based protein hub detection framework with FuSim-II working as the underlying proximity measure. The PPINs of H. Sapiens and M. Musculus organisms are chosen for experimental purposes. Unlike most of the existing hub-detection methods, the proposed technique does not require to follow any protein degree cut-off or threshold to define hubs. A thorough assessment of efficiency between proposed and existing eight protein similarity measures along with eight single/multi-objective clustering methods has been carried out. Internal cluster validity indices like Silhouette and Davies Bouldin (DB) are deployed to accomplish analytical study. Also, a comparative performance analysis between proposed and five existing hub-proteins detection algorithms is conducted through the enrichment of essentiality study. The reported results show the improved performance of FuSim-II over existing protein similarity measures in terms of identifying functionally related proteins as well as relevant hub-proteins.

Information on the effects of S&SEs in regard to health and efficacy can be found in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that exist in peer-reviewed literature. With the large number of RCT publications on various S&SEs, a need exists to organise and collect each of the published studies in a useful database. Currently, a database containing human clinical information on S&SEs does not exist and so The SWEET project has created a publicly available and comprehensive Health Impact Database that includes available human clinical information on sweeteners. This paper describes the process and development of a database that collects comprehensive information on published human clinical studies evaluating S&SEs between the years January 2000 and September 2024. Ovid Medline was used to search for RCT publications from the year 2000 to 2024. The search produced 1538 publications, of which 257 complied with the predetermined eligibility criteria. There was a large variability in the number of studies that fit the inclusion criteria. For example, some S&SEs had numerous studies (i.e., sucralose, n = 63 eligible publications) and some S&SEs had no publications that fit the criteria (aspartame-acesulfame K salt and neohesperidine DC). The Health Impact Database is located at https://sweetproject.eu/HIdatabase and is contained in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets which are organised by health impact criteria. This database will be a useful tool for researchers as it provides comprehensive information on human clinical studies on S&SEs that can be leveraged as a general resource and for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.",True,False,4.0,,comprehensive health impact database | the health impact database | https://sweetproject.eu/hidatabase,rct,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Health Impact Database Development for Sweeteners and Sweetness Enhancers,True,5.0,False,False,https://sweetproject.eu/HIdatabase,https://sweetproject.eu/HIdatabase,True,...ine DC).

Since their initial discovery, a large number of them have been identified experimentally or computationally. However, no comprehensive and unified database that provides group I intron sequences with precise boundaries and structural information is available.<h4>Results</h4>We created a new database of group I intron sequences with reliable exon-intron boundaries. The database offers additional data for each sequence, such as containing GenBank entry, its position within the associated entry, the subtype of each intron and putative homing endonucleases. Secondary structure predictions and base-pairing probability matrixes are also provided for each sequence. The resource is expected to facilitate large-scale studies of group I introns, as well as engineering for novel applications.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The database, as well as the code to generate it and a GUI to facilitate its exploration, are available at https://github.com/LaraSellesVidal/Group1IntronDatabase.

35561185,Network-based cancer heterogeneity analysis incorporating multi-view of prior information.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Cancer genetic heterogeneity analysis has critical implications for tumour classification, response to therapy and choice of biomarkers to guide personalized cancer medicine. However, existing heterogeneity analysis based solely on molecular profiling data usually suffers from a lack of information and has limited effectiveness. Many biomedical and life sciences databases have accumulated a substantial volume of meaningful biological information. They can provide additional information beyond molecular profiling data, yet pose challenges arising from potential noise and uncertainty.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we aim to develop a more effective heterogeneity analysis method with the help of prior information. A network-based penalization technique is proposed to innovatively incorporate a multi-view of prior information from multiple databases, which accommodates heterogeneity attributed to both differential genes and gene relationships. To account for the fact that the prior information might not be fully credible, we propose a weighted strategy, where the weight is determined dependent on the data and can ensure that the present model is not excessively disturbed by incorrect information. Simulation and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma multiforme data demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>R code implementing the proposed method is available at https://github.com/mengyunwu2020/PECM.

37953362,"A new paradigm for molecular dynamics databases: the COVID-19 database, the legacy of a titanic community effort.","Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are keeping computers busy around the world, generating a huge amount of data that is typically not open to the scientific community. Pioneering efforts to ensure the safety and reusability of MD data have been based on the use of simple databases providing a limited set of standard analyses on single-short trajectories. Despite their value, these databases do not offer a true solution for the current community of MD users, who want a flexible analysis pipeline and the possibility to address huge non-Markovian ensembles of large systems. Here we present a new paradigm for MD databases, resilient to large systems and long trajectories, and designed to be compatible with modern MD simulations. The data are offered to the community through a web-based graphical user interface (GUI), implemented with state-of-the-art technology, which incorporates system-specific analysis designed by the trajectory providers. A REST API and associated Jupyter Notebooks are integrated into the platform, allowing fully customized meta-analysis by final users. The new technology is illustrated using a collection of trajectories obtained by the community in the context of the effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

Currently, there is a large amount of information available about kinases and their substrates in disparate public databases. However, these data are difficult to interpret in the context of cellular systems, which can be facilitated by examining interactions among multiple proteins at once, such as the network of interactions that constitute a signaling pathway. We present KiNet, a user-friendly web portal that integrates and shares information about kinase-substrate interactions from multiple databases of post-translational modifications. KiNet enables the visual exploration of these interactions in systems contexts, such as pathways, domain families, and custom protein set inputs, in an interactive fashion.

Identifying final common pathways/molecular signatures that integrate this heterogeneity informs biomarker and therapeutic-target development. We present the first large-scale murine single-cell atlas of the transcriptomic response to TBI (334,376 cells) across clinically relevant models, sex, brain region, and time as a foundational step in molecularly deconstructing TBI heterogeneity. Results were unique to cell populations, injury models, sex, brain regions, and time, highlighting the importance of cell-level resolution. We identify cell-specific targets and previously unrecognized roles for microglial and ependymal subtypes. Ependymal-4 was a hub of neuroinflammatory signaling. A distinct microglial lineage shared features with disease-associated microglia at 24 h, with persistent gene-expression changes in microglia-4 even 6 months after contusional TBI, contrasting all other cell types that mostly returned to naive levels.

39412443,Lifestyle factors in the biomedical literature: an ontology and comprehensive resources for named entity recognition.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Despite lifestyle factors (LSFs) being increasingly acknowledged in shaping individual health trajectories, particularly in chronic diseases, they have still not been systematically described in the biomedical literature. This is in part because no named entity recognition (NER) system exists, which can comprehensively detect all types of LSFs in text. The task is challenging due to their inherent diversity, lack of a comprehensive LSF classification for dictionary-based NER, and lack of a corpus for deep learning-based NER.<h4>Results</h4>We present a novel lifestyle factor ontology (LSFO), which we used to develop a dictionary-based system for recognition and normalization of LSFs. Additionally, we introduce a manually annotated corpus for LSFs (LSF200) suitable for training and evaluation of NER systems, and use it to train a transformer-based system. Evaluating the performance of both NER systems on the corpus revealed an F-score of 64% for the dictionary-based system and 76% for the transformer-based system. Large-scale application of these systems on PubMed abstracts and PMC Open Access articles identified over 300 million mentions of LSF in the biomedical literature.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>LSFO, the annotated LSF200 corpus, and the detected LSFs in PubMed and PMC-OA articles using both NER systems, are available under open licenses via the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/EsmaeilNourani/LSFO-expansion.

We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for NODAP and develop an online prediction tool using conventional variables based on a multicenter database. China evidence-based Chinese medicine database consisted of 249, 987 patients from 4 hospitals in mainland China. Patients ≥ 18 years with implanted coronary stents for acute coronary syndromes and did not have diabetes before PCI were enrolled in this study. According to the occurrence of new-onset diabetes mellitus after PCI, the patients were divided into NODAP and Non-NODAP. After least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and logistic regression, the model features were selected and then the nomogram was developed and plotted. Model performance was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and decision curve analysis. The nomogram was also externally validated at a different hospital. Subsequently, we developed an online visualization tool and a corresponding risk stratification system to predict the risk of developing NODAP after PCI based on the model. A total of 2698 patients after PCI (1255 NODAP and 1443 non-NODAP) were included in the final analysis based on the multicenter database.

37004080,Allelic phenotype prediction of phenylketonuria based on the machine learning method.,"<h4>Background</h4>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Our study aimed to predict the phenotype using the allelic genotype.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 1291 PKU patients with 623 various variants were used as the training dataset for predicting allelic phenotypes. We designed a common machine learning framework to predict allelic genotypes associated with the phenotype.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 235 different mutations and 623 various allelic genotypes. The features extracted from the structure of mutations and graph properties of the PKU network to predict the phenotype of PKU were named PPML (PKU phenotype predicted by machine learning). The phenotype of PKU was classified into three different categories: classical PKU (cPKU), mild PKU (mPKU) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). Three hub nodes (c.728G>A for cPKU, c.721 for mPKU and c.158G>A for HPA) were used as each classification center, and 5 node attributes were extracted from the network graph for machine learning training features. The area under the ROC curve was AUC = 0.832 for cPKU, AUC = 0.678 for mPKU and AUC = 0.874 for MHP. This suggests that PPML is a powerful method to predict allelic phenotypes in PKU and can be used for genetic counseling of PKU families.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The web version of PPML predicts PKU allele classification supported by applicable real cases and prediction results.

36480100,A molecular network map of orexin-orexin receptor signaling system.,"Orexins are excitatory neuropeptides, which are predominantly associated with feeding behavior, sleep-wake cycle and energy homeostasis. The orexinergic system comprises of HCRTR1 and HCRTR2, G-protein-coupled receptors of rhodopsin family and the endogenous ligands processed from HCRT pro-hormone, Orexin A and Orexin B. These neuropeptides are biosynthesized by the orexin neurons present in the lateral hypothalamus area, with dense projections to other brain regions. The orexin-receptor signaling is implicated in various metabolic as well as neurological disorders, making it a promising target for pharmacological interventions.

35595749,A 3D gene expression atlas of the floral meristem based on spatial reconstruction of single nucleus RNA sequencing data.,"Cellular heterogeneity in growth and differentiation results in organ patterning. Single-cell transcriptomics allows characterization of gene expression heterogeneity in developing organs at unprecedented resolution. However, the original physical location of the cell is lost during this methodology. To recover the original location of cells in the developing organ is essential to link gene activity with cellular identity and function in plants. Here, we propose a method to reconstruct genome-wide gene expression patterns of individual cells in a 3D flower meristem by combining single-nuclei RNA-seq with microcopy-based 3D spatial reconstruction. By this, gene expression differences among meristematic domains giving rise to different tissue and organ types can be determined. As a proof of principle, the method is used to trace the initiation of vascular identity within the floral meristem.

Traditional quantitation pipelines for isobaric-labeled mass spectrometry data are based on sequence database searching. In this study, we present a novel quantitation pipeline that integrates sequence database searching, spectral library searching, and a feature-based peptide-spectrum-match (PSM) filter using various spectral features for filtering. The combined database and spectral library searching results in larger quantitation coverage, and the filter removes PSMs with larger quantitation errors, retaining those with higher quantitation accuracy. Quantitation results show that the proposed pipeline can improve the overall quantitation accuracy at the PSM and protein levels.

Unlike diffraction, for which one can quickly calculate the scattering pattern from the structure, the calculation of INS spectra from the structure involves multiple steps requiring significant experience and computational resources. To overcome this barrier, a database of INS spectra consisting of commonly seen materials will be a valuable reference, and it will also lay the foundation of advanced data-driven analysis and interpretation of INS spectra. Here we report such a database compiled for over 20,000 organic molecules and over 10,000 inorganic crystals. The INS spectra are obtained from a streamlined workflow, and the synthetic INS spectra are also verified by available experimental data.

40626310,Understanding the treatment of acute pancreatitis and its complications -a database for assessing traditional Chinese medicine use.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Integrative medicine combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with biomedicine has become a notable approach for treating acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the absence of a comprehensive and reliable database to store and organize TCM-related data for the prevention and treatment of AP presents a significant challenge for the development of herbal medicines. To develop a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for browsing, querying, and analyzing TCM-related data for treating AP.<h4>Methods</h4>TCM-related data for treating AP were systematically extracted from the literature and established databases. The front-end interface was developed using HyperText Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript to enhance user experience. The back-end employed Hypertext Preprocessor and My Structured Query Language for improved performance and security. The Smarty template engine was utilized to separate the front-end and back-end, facilitating efficient updates to the TCMAP platform.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>The current version of the TCMAP includes: (i) documentation of 200 evidence-based TCM formulations, with comprehensive details on clinical applications, targets related to AP, and target pathway enrichment analysis, including 449 herbs; (ii) records of 58 natural metabolites, involving extensive information on their potential targets and pharmacological properties; and (iii) integration with a web server enables users to conduct similarity and enrichment analyses of input prescriptions based on herbs, metabolites, and genes. Furthermore, TCMAP also supports discovering anti-AP herb pairs with similar metabolites and targets. Network analysis further provides users with the intrinsic properties of anti-AP formulations.

To assess the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with GSRCC, prognostic nomograms were developed and validated using common clinical factors.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study included patients diagnosed with GSRCC between 2011 and 2018 from the National Cancer Center (n = 1453) and SEER databases (n = 2745). Prognostic nomograms were established by identifying independent prognostic factors using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The calibration curve and C-index were used to assess the predictions. The clinical usefulness of the survival prediction model was further evaluated using the DCA and ROC curves. The models were internally validated in the training cohort and externally validated in the validation cohort. Two web servers were created to make the nomogram easier to use.<h4>Results</h4>Patients with GSRCC were divided into training (<i>n</i> = 2938) and validation (<i>n</i> = 1260) cohorts. The nomograms incorporated six predictors: age, race, tumor site, tumor size, N stage, T stage, and AJCC stage. Excellent agreement was observed between the internal and exterior calibration plots for the GSRCC survival estimates. The C-index and area under the ROC curve were roughly greater than 0.7.

Taking humanization as example, both of the two ways first find the proper template for heavy and light chains with CDR-grafting followed. For rational design, bioinformatics analysis-based backmutation is then conducted. For AI-assisted computational design, the backmutation and humanness evaluation are implemented through evolutionary computation framework with DeepForest-based humanness evaluation model and the distance to the previously found human template as objective functions. Finally, the top <i>K</i> heterologized antibodies can be provided by YabXnization platform. We examined the platform with 18 antibodies to be heterologized, in which 10 for humanization, 6 for caninization and 2 for felinization, respectively. The heterologized antibodies were measured by indirect ELISA and BLI(Octet)/SPR(Biacore) binding affinity measurement methods. Test results show a 90% success rate with the binding affinity loss of heterologized antibodies within an order of magnitude compared to the corresponding chimeric antibodies. It even shows an increase in the binding affinity on some of the heterologized antibodies.

38448141,Genome-based solutions for managing mucormycosis.,"An uncommon opportunistic fungal infection known as mucormycosis is caused by a class of molds called mucoromycetes. Currently, antifungal therapy and surgical debridement are the primary treatment options for mucormycosis. Despite the importance of comprehensive knowledge on mucormycosis, there is a lack of well-annotated databases that provide all relevant information. In this study, we have gathered and organized all available information related to mucormycosis that include disease's genome, proteins, diagnostic methods. Furthermore, using the AlphaFold2.0 prediction tool, we have predicted the tertiary structures of potential drug targets. We have categorized the information into three major sections: ""genomics/proteomics,"" ""immunotherapy,"" and ""drugs."" The genomics/proteomics module contains information on different strains responsible for mucormycosis. The immunotherapy module includes putative sequence-based therapeutics predicted using established tools. Drugs module provides information on available drugs for treating the disease. Additionally, the drugs module also offers prerequisite information for designing computationally aided drugs, such as putative targets and predicted structures.

38809899,Mapping the evidence on factors related to postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women in the United States of America: A scoping review protocol.,"<h4>Background</h4>Postpartum contraception is essential to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care because it encourages healthy spacing between births, helps women avoid unwanted pregnancies, and lessens the risks of health problems for mothers and babies. Sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee populations are rapidly increasing in the United States, and they come from a wide range of cultural, linguistic, religious, and social origins, which may pose challenges in timely access to culturally acceptable SRH care, for preventing mistimed or unwanted childbearing. The objective of this scoping review is to assess the extent of the available literature on postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women living in the United States.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed preliminary search terms with the help of an expert librarian, consisting of keywords including birth intervals, birth spacing, contraception, postpartum contraception or family planning, and USA or America, and sub-Saharan African immigrants, or emigrants. The study will include the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Global Health Database. The sources will include studies on postpartum care and contraceptive access and utilization among sub-Saharan African immigrants living in the US. Citations, abstracts, and full texts will be independently screened by two reviewers. We will use narrative synthesis to analyze the data using quantitative and qualitative methods. Factors associated with postpartum contraception will be organized using the domains and constructs of the PEN-3 Model as a guiding framework.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This scoping review will map the research on postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women living in the US. We expect to identify knowledge gaps, and barriers and facilitators of postpartum contraception in this population. Based on the findings of the review, recommendations will be made for advocacy and program and policy development toward optimizing interpregnancy intervals in sub-Saharan African immigrants living in the US.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Review registration Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/s385j.",True,False,3.5,,psycinfo | global health database | review registration open science framework,,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Mapping the evidence on factors related to postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women in the United States of America,False,0.0,False,False,https://osf.io/s385j,https://osf.io/s385j,True,...n</h4>Review registration Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/s385j.,1
35352997,Microbial Identification Using rRNA Operon Region: Database and Tool for Metataxonomics with Long-Read Sequence.,"Recent development of long-read sequencing platforms has enabled researchers to explore bacterial community structure through analysis of full-length 16S rRNA gene (∼1,500 bp) or 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region (∼4,300 bp), resulting in higher taxonomic resolution than short-read sequencing platforms. Despite the potential of long-read sequencing in metagenomics, resources and protocols for this technology are scarce. Here, we describe MIrROR, the database and analysis tool for metataxonomics using the bacterial 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region. We collected 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon sequences extracted from bacterial genomes from NCBI GenBank and performed curation. A total of 97,781 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon sequences covering 9,485 species from 43,653 genomes were obtained. For user convenience, we provide an analysis tool based on a mapping strategy that can be used for taxonomic profiling with MIrROR database. To benchmark MIrROR, we compared performance against publicly available databases and tool with mock communities and simulated data sets. Our platform showed promising results in terms of the number of species covered and the accuracy of classification. To encourage active 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon analysis in the field, BLAST function and taxonomic profiling results with 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon studies, which have been reported as BioProject on NCBI are provided. MIrROR (http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/) will be a useful platform for researchers who want to perform high-resolution metagenome analysis with a cost-effective sequencer such as MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Metabarcoding is a powerful tool to investigate community diversity in an economic and efficient way by amplifying a specific gene marker region. With the advancement of long-read sequencing technologies, the field of metabarcoding has entered a new phase. The technologies have brought a need for development in several areas, including new markers that long-read can cover, database for the markers, tools that reflect long-read characteristics, and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. By constructing MIrROR, we met the need for a database and tools for the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region, which has recently been shown to have sufficient resolution at the species level. Bacterial community analysis using the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region with MIrROR will provide new insights from various research fields.",True,False,4.0,,genbank | bioproject,mirror,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Microbial Identification Using rRNA Operon Region,True,5.0,False,False,http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/,http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/,True,...orted as BioProject on NCBI are provided.

35435220,An atlas of human viruses provides new insights into diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Viruses continue to threaten human health. Yet, the complete viral species carried by humans and their infection characteristics have not been fully revealed.<h4>Results</h4>This study curated an atlas of human viruses from public databases and literature, and built the Human Virus Database (HVD). The HVD contains 1131 virus species of 54 viral families which were more than twice the number of the human-infecting virus species reported in previous studies. These viruses were identified in human samples including 68 human tissues, the excreta and body fluid. The viral diversity in humans was age-dependent with a peak in the infant and a valley in the teenager. The tissue tropism of viruses was found to be associated with several factors including the viral group (DNA, RNA or reverse-transcribing viruses), enveloped or not, viral genome length and GC content, viral receptors and the virus-interacting proteins. Finally, the tissue tropism of DNA viruses was predicted using a random-forest algorithm with a middle performance. Overall, the study not only provides a valuable resource for further studies of human viruses but also deepens our understanding toward the diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The HVD is available at http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,human virus database,hvd,6.0,conflict,hvd | human virus database,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/,http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/,True,...ty and implementation</h4>The HVD is available at http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
39139072,Comparative transcriptome database for Camellia sinensis reveals genes related to the cold sensitivity and albino mechanism of 'Anji Baicha'.,"Tea, a globally popular beverage, contains various beneficial secondary metabolites. Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) exhibit diverse genetic traits across cultivars, impacting yield, adaptability, morphology, and secondary metabolite composition. Many tea cultivars have been the subject of much research interest, which have led to the accumulation of publicly available RNA-seq data. As such, it has become possible to systematically summarize the characteristics of different cultivars at the transcriptomic level, identify functional genes, and infer gene functions through co-expression analysis. Here, the transcriptomes of 9 tea cultivars were assembled, and comparative analysis was conducted on the coding sequences of 13 cultivars. To give access to this data, we present TeaNekT (https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/), a web resource that facilitates the prediction of gene functions of various tea cultivars. We used TeaNekT to perform a cross-cultivar comparison of co-expressed gene clusters and tissue-specific gene expression. We observed that 'Anji Baicha' possesses the highest number of cultivar-specific genes and the second-highest number of expanded genes. These genes in 'Anji Baicha' tend to be enriched in functions associated with cold stress response, chloroplast thylakoid structure, and nitrogen metabolism. Notably, we identified three significantly expanded homologous genes in 'Anji Baicha' encoding the ICE1, SIZ1, and MAPKK2, which are closely associated with the cold sensitivity of 'Anji Baicha'. Additionally, one significantly expanded homologous gene in 'Anji Baicha' encoding regulatory factor RIQ may play a crucial role in the abnormal chloroplast structure and absence of thylakoid membranes in 'Anji Baicha'.",True,False,3.0,,teanekt,siz1,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/,https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/,True,"...To give access to this data, we present TeaNekT (https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/), a web resource that facilitates the prediction...",1

Urine samples were analysed with the UBC<sup>®</sup> Rapid test. The nomograms were developed using data from 320 patients and externally validated using data from 274 patients. The diagnostic accuracy of the UBC<sup>®</sup> Rapid test was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. Brier scores and calibration curves were chosen for the validation. Biopsy-proven BC was predicted using multivariate logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve for the UBC<sup>®</sup> Rapid test were 46.4%, 75.5% and 0.61 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.64) for low-grade (LG) BC, and 70.5%, 75.5% and 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76) for high-grade (HG) BC, respectively. Age, UBC<sup>®</sup> Rapid test results, smoking status and haematuria were identified as independent predictors of primary BC. After external validation, nomograms based on these predictors resulted in areas under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.72-0.87) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92-0.98) for predicting LG-BC and HG-BC, respectively, showing excellent calibration associated with a higher net benefit than the UBC<sup>®</sup> Rapid test alone for low and medium risk levels in decision curve analysis. The R Shiny app allows the results to be explored interactively and can be accessed at www.blucab-index.net.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The UBC<sup>®</sup> Rapid test alone has limited clinical utility for predicting the presence of BC. However, its combined use with BC risk factors including age, smoking status and haematuria provides a fast, highly accurate and non-invasive tool for screening patients for primary LG-BC and especially primary HG-BC.",True,False,4.5,,www.blucab,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,http://www.blucab-index.net,http://www.blucab-index.net,True,,1
40728615,An Online Server for Geometry-Aware Protein Function Annotations Through Predicted Structure.,"Understanding protein functions is critical for metagenomic research, disease mechanism elucidation, and rational drug discovery. Traditional biochemical methods to determine protein functions are often inefficient and costly, leading to a widening gap between the rapid accumulation of protein sequences and their functional annotations.

In first-line, for hormone receptor (HR)-positive MBC, when a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor and CDK 4/6 inhibitor combination is unavailable, use hormonal therapy alone. For life-threatening disease, use single-agent chemotherapy or surgery for local control. For premenopausal patients, use ovarian suppression or ablation plus hormone therapy in Basic settings. For human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive MBC, if trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and chemotherapy are unavailable, use trastuzumab and chemotherapy; if unavailable, use chemotherapy. For HER2-positive, HR-positive MBC, use standard first-line therapy, or endocrine therapy if contraindications. For triple-negative MBC with unknown PD-L1 status, or if PD-L1-positive and immunotherapy unavailable, use single-agent chemotherapy. For germline <i>BRCA1</i>/<i>2</i> mutation-positive MBC, if poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor is unavailable, use hormonal therapy (HR-positive MBC) and chemotherapy (HR-negative MBC). In second-line, for HR-positive MBC, Enhanced setting recommendations depend on prior treatment; for Limited, use tamoxifen or chemotherapy. For HER2-positive MBC, if trastuzumab deruxtecan is unavailable, use trastuzumab emtansine; if unavailable, capecitabine and lapatinib; if unavailable, trastuzumab and/or chemotherapy (hormonal therapy alone for HR-positive MBC).Additional information is available at www.asco.org/resource-stratified-guidelines.

Here, we developed a novel BLAST-based method to predict linear B cell epitopes. To that end, we generated a BLAST-formatted database upon a dataset of 62,730 known linear B cell epitope sequences and considered as a B cell epitope any peptide sequence producing ungapped BLAST hits to this database with identity ≥ 80% and length ≥ 8. We examined B cell epitope predictions by this method in tenfold cross-validations in which we considered various types of non-B cell epitopes, including 62,730 peptide sequences with verified negative B cell assays. As a result, we obtained values of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 72.54 ± 0.27%, 81.59 ± 0.37% and 63.49 ± 0.43%, respectively. In an independent dataset incorporating 503 B cell epitopes, this method reached accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 74.85%, 99.20% and 50.50%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods to predict linear B cell epitopes.

40467750,Development of a machine learning-based model to predict urethral recurrence following radical cystectomy: a multicentre retrospective study and updated meta-analysis.,"Urethral recurrence (UR) following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer represents an aggressive disease failure with typically poor survival outcomes. Our study aimed to assess the predictive risk factors for UR, to develop and validate an easy-to-use predictive tool of UR in our region based on machine learning algorithms and to update the meta-analysis of risk factors for UR in combination with our results to improve its accuracy and reliability. Clinicopathological data from the patients who underwent RC between 2010 and 2020 at multiple centres were collected. To confirm the independent risk factors for UR, univariate and multivariate Cox regression were applied. We conducted internal validation by randomly partitioning the dataset into train (80%) and test (20%) subsets for UR prediction model development and validation. We developed UR predictive models using ten machine learning algorithms and evaluated the model performance by the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and other metrics (F1 score, Brier score, C-index). The best-performing model was selected based on these criteria. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to calculate the contribution of each feature to the machine learning prediction with best performance and develop online calculator based on the machine model with the best performance. Moreover, to avoid bias from single-region studies for the risk factors identifications, we searched the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases published before April 2025 to perform a meta-analysis of patient-, tumour- and treatment-specific factors for UR. In our multi-centre study, 473 patients were analysed with a UR rate of 8.24%, concomitant CIS (HR: 2.02, p = 0.039) and tumor multifocality (HR: 2.89, p = 0.004) were demonstrated to be independent predictors for UR. Among the ten different machine learning methods, the gradient boosting machine model demonstrated the best predictive performance which reached AUC of 0.865 (95%CI: 0.805-0.926) and 0.778 (95%CI: 0.558-0.968) in train and test set respectively. Moreover, to benefit from the clinical implications of the predictive model, an easy-to-use risk calculator tool for UR was developed online ( https://zluxin.shinyapps.io/make_web/ ) based on the GBM model. In the updated meta-analysis, a history of TURBT (HR: 2.56, p = 0.019), bladder neck or trigeminal or prostate involvement (HR: 3.39, p < 0.001), tumor multifocality (HR: 2.05, p < 0.001), concomitant CIS (HR: 1.74, p = 0.006), lymphovascular invasion (HR: 1.95, p = 0.028), diversion type (HR: 0.47, p < 0.001) and receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 1.36, p = 0.019) were significant predictors of UR. Tumour multifocality and concomitant CIS were independent predictors for UR in the retrospective multicentre research and meta-analysis.

Recent advances in BioRE research have largely been powered by supervised learning and large language models (LLMs). However, training of LLMs for BioRE with supervised learning requires human-annotated data, and the annotation process often accompanies challenging and expensive work. As a result, the quantity and coverage of annotated data are limiting factors for BioRE systems. In this paper, we present our system for the BioCreative VII challenge-DrugProt track, a BioRE system that leverages a language model structure and weak supervision. Our system is trained on weakly labelled data and then fine-tuned using human-labelled data. To create the weakly labelled dataset, we combined two approaches. First, we trained a model on the original dataset to predict labels on external literature, which will become a model-labelled dataset. Then, we refined the model-labelled dataset using an external knowledge base. Based on our experiment, our approach using refined weak supervision showed significant performance gain over the model trained using standard human-labelled datasets. Our final model showed outstanding performance at the BioCreative VII challenge, achieving 3rd place (this paper focuses on our participating system in the BioCreative VII challenge).

38650009,Identification of osteoporosis ferroptosis-related markers and potential therapeutic compounds based on bioinformatics methods and molecular docking technology.,"<h4>Research background and purpose</h4>Osteoporosis (OP) is one of the most common bone diseases worldwide, characterized by low bone mineral density and susceptibility to pathological fractures, especially in postmenopausal women and elderly men. Ferroptosis is one of the newly discovered forms of cell death regulated by genes in recent years. Many studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely related to many diseases. However, there are few studies on ferroptosis in osteoporosis, and the mechanism of ferroptosis in osteoporosis is still unclear. This study aims to identify biomarkers related to osteoporosis ferroptosis from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database through bioinformatics technology, and to mine potential therapeutic small molecule compounds through molecular docking technology, trying to provide a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in the future.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We downloaded the ferroptosis-related gene set from the FerrDb database ( http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/index.html ), downloaded the data sets GSE56815 and GSE7429 from the GEO database, and used the R software ""limma"" package to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from GSE56815, and intersected with the ferroptosis gene set to obtain ferroptosis-related DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed by the R software ""clusterProfiler"" package. The random forest model was further screened to obtain essential ferroptosis genes. R software ""corrplot"" package was used for correlation analysis of essential ferroptosis genes, and the Wilcox test was used for significance analysis. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to construct a disease diagnosis model, and a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the diagnostic performance, and then GSE7429 was used to verify the reliability of the diagnosis model. Molecular docking technology was used to screen potential small molecule compounds from the Drugbank database. Finally, a rat osteoporosis model was constructed, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted for qRT-PCR detection to verify the mRNA expression levels of crucial ferroptosis genes.<h4>Result</h4>Six DEGs related to ferroptosis were initially screened out. GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that ferroptosis-related DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as maintenance of iron ion homeostasis, copper ion binding function, and ferroptosis. The random forest model identified five key ferroptosis genes, including CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1, and SLC2A3. Gene correlation analysis found a relatively low correlation between these five key ferroptosis genes. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network shows that BAZ1B and STAT3 may also be potential molecules. The ROC curve of the disease diagnosis model shows that the model has a good diagnostic performance. Molecular docking technology screened out three small molecule compounds, including NADH, Midostaurin, and Nintedanib small molecule compounds. qRT-PCR detection confirmed the differential expression of CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1 and SLC2A3 between OP and normal control group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified five key ferroptosis genes (CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1, and SLC2A3), they were most likely related to OP ferroptosis. In addition, we found that the small molecule compounds of NADH, Midostaurin, and Nintedanib had good docking scores with these five key ferroptosis genes.

38438345,A spatially-resolved transcriptional atlas of the murine dorsal pons at single-cell resolution.,"The ""dorsal pons"", or ""dorsal pontine tegmentum"" (dPnTg), is part of the brainstem. It is a complex, densely packed region whose nuclei are involved in regulating many vital functions. Notable among them are the parabrachial nucleus, the Kölliker Fuse, the Barrington nucleus, the locus coeruleus, and the dorsal, laterodorsal, and ventral tegmental nuclei. In this study, we applied single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to resolve neuronal subtypes based on their unique transcriptional profiles and then used multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to map them spatially. We sampled ~1 million cells across the dPnTg and defined the spatial distribution of over 120 neuronal subtypes. Our analysis identified an unpredicted high transcriptional diversity in this region and pinpointed the unique marker genes of many neuronal subtypes. We also demonstrated that many neuronal subtypes are transcriptionally similar between humans and mice, enhancing this study's translational value.

Over the past 6 years, this growing interest has led to the development of more than 100 bioinformatics tools and nearly 50 resources, primarily in the form of ligand-receptor databases. These tools vary widely in their requirements, scoring approaches, ability to infer inter- and/or intra-cellular communication, assumptions, and limitations. Similarly, cell-cell communication resources differ in many aspects, mainly in the number of annotated interactions, species coverage, and their focus on inter-cellular signaling or both inter- and intra-cellular communication. This abundance and diversity create challenges in identifying compatible and suitable tools and resources to meet specific user needs. In this collaborative effort, we aim to provide a comprehensive report on the current state of cell-cell communication analysis derived from single-cell or spatial transcriptomics data. The report reviews existing methods and resources, addressing all relevant aspects from the user's perspective.

The objective of this study is to develop an effective text-mining approach that automatically extracts clinical phenotype definitions-related sentences from biomedical literature. Abstract-level and full-text sentence-level classifiers were developed for clinical phenotype discovery from PubMed. We compared the performance of the abstract-level classifier on machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes, and decision tree. SVM classifier showed the best performance (F-measure = 98%) in identifying clinical phenotype-relevant abstracts. It predicted 459 406 clinical phenotype-related abstracts. For the full-text sentence-level classifier, we compared the performance of SVM, LR, naïve Bayes, decision trees, convolutional neural networks, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT). BioBERT model was the best performer among the full-text sentence-level classifiers (F-measure = 91%). We used these two optimal classifiers for large-scale screening of the PubMed database, starting with abstract retrieval and followed by predicting clinical phenotype-related sentences from full texts. The large-scale screening predicted over two million clinical phenotype-related sentences. Lastly, we developed a knowledgebase using positively predicted sentences, allowing users to query clinical phenotype-related sentences with a phenotype term of interest. The Clinical Phenotype Knowledgebase (CliPheKB) enables users to search for clinical phenotype terms and retrieve sentences related to a specific clinical phenotype of interest (https://cliphekb.shinyapps.io/phenotype-main/).

Numerous databases are available for miR target prediction and validation, but their functionality is varied, and outputs are not standardized. The purpose of this review is to identify and describe databases for cataloging validated miR targets. Using Tools4miRs and PubMed, we identified databases with experimentally validated targets, human data, and a focus on miR-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions. Data were extracted about the number of times each database was cited, the number of miRs, the target genes, the interactions per database, experimental methodology and key features of each database. The search yielded 10 databases, which in order of most cited to least were: miRTarBase, starBase/The Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes, DIANA-TarBase, miRWalk, miRecords, miRGator, miRSystem, miRGate, miRSel and targetHub. Findings from this review suggest that the information presented within miR target validation databases can be enhanced by adding features such as flexibility in performing queries in multiple ways, downloadable data, ongoing updates and integrating tools for further miR-mRNA target interaction analysis.

However, there are still a large number of ncRNAs whose functions remain to be studied. Despite decades of research, the field continues to evolve, with each newly identified ncRNA undergoing processes such as biogenesis, identification, and functional annotation. Bioinformatics methodologies, alongside traditional biochemical experimental methods, have played an important role in advancing ncRNA research across various stages. Presently, over 50 types of ncRNAs have been characterized, each exhibiting diverse functions. However, there remains a need for standardization and integration of these ncRNAs within a unified framework.

The molecular and cellular mechanisms of sepsis are still unclear. We aim to identify key genes in sepsis and reveal potential disease mechanisms. Six sepsis-related blood transcriptome datasets were collected and analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Functional annotation was performed in the gProfiler tool. DSigDB was used for drug signature enrichment analysis. The proportion of immune cells was estimated by the CIBERSORT tool. The relationships between modules, immune cells, and survival were identified by correlation analysis and survival analysis. A total of 37 stable co-expressed gene modules were identified. These modules were associated with the critical biology process in sepsis. Four modules can independently separate patients with long and short survival. Three modules can recurrently separate sepsis and normal patients with high accuracy. Some modules can separate bacterial pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, mixed bacterial and influenza A pneumonia, and non-infective systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

Accurate identification of antibiotic resistant strains is essential for the control of infection. In the present study, our goal is to leverage the whole-genome data of <i>H. pylori</i> to develop practical and interpretable machine learning (ML) models for comprehensive antibiotic resistance assessment. A total of 296 <i>H. pylori</i> isolates with genome-wide data were downloaded from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. By training ML models on feature sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms from SNP calling (SNPs-1), antibiotic-resistance SNP annotated by the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (SNPs-2), gene presence or absence (GPA), we generated predictive models for four antibiotics and multidrug-resistance (MDR). Among them, the models that combined SNPs-1, SNPs-2, and GPA data demonstrated the best performance, with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) consistently outperforming others. And then we utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the ML models. Furthermore, a free web application for the MDR model was deployed to the GitHub repository (https://H.pylori/MDR/App/).

In our latest effort, we have expanded MGIS to incorporate in situ observations. We thus incorporated more than 3000 in situ observations from 133 countries primarily sourced from iNaturalist, GBIF, Flickr, Pl@ntNet, Google Street view and expert curation of the literature. This addition provides a more comprehensive and detailed view of banana diversity and its distribution. Additional graphical interfaces, supported by new Drupal modules, were developed, allowing users to compare banana accessions and explore them based on various filters including taxonomy and geographic location. The integrated maps present a unified view, showcasing both in situ observations and the collecting locations of accessions held in germplasm collections. This enhancement not only broadens the scope of MGIS but also promotes a collaborative and open approach in documenting banana diversity, to allow more effective conservation and use of banana germplasm.

AMR strains of microbial pathogens arise through multiple mechanisms. The underlying ""antibiotic resistance genes"" (ARGs) spread through various species by lateral gene transfer thereby causing global dissemination. Human methods also augment this process through inappropriate use, non-compliance to treatment schedule, and environmental waste. Worldwide significant efforts are being invested to discover novel therapeutic solutions for tackling resistant pathogens. Diverse therapeutic strategies have evolved over recent years. In this work we have developed a comprehensive knowledgebase by collecting alternative antimicrobial therapeutic strategies from literature data. Therapeutic strategies against bacteria, virus, fungus and parasites were extracted from PubMed literature using text mining. We have used a subjective (sentimental) approach for data mining new strategies, resulting in broad coverage of novel entities and subsequently add objective data like entity name (including IUPAC), potency, and safety information. The extracted data was organized in a freely accessible web platform, KOMBAT. The KOMBAT comprises 1104 Chemical compounds, 220 of newly identified antimicrobial peptides, 42 bacteriophages, 242 phytochemicals, 106 nanocomposites, and 94 novel entities for phototherapy.

36550341,Towards Effective Consensus Scoring in Structure-Based Virtual Screening.,"Virtual screening (VS) is a computational strategy that uses in silico automated protein docking inter alia to rank potential ligands, or by extension rank protein-ligand pairs, identifying potential drug candidates. Most docking methods use preferred sets of physicochemical descriptors (PCDs) to model the interactions between host and guest molecules. Thus, conventional VS is often data-specific, method-dependent and with demonstrably differing utility in identifying candidate drugs. This study proposes four universality classes of novel consensus scoring (CS) algorithms that combine docking scores, derived from ten docking programs (ADFR, DOCK, Gemdock, Ledock, PLANTS, PSOVina, QuickVina2, Smina, Autodock Vina and VinaXB), using decoys from the DUD-E repository ( http://dude.docking.org/ ) against 29 MRSA-oriented targets to create a general VS formulation that can identify active ligands for any suitable protein target. Our results demonstrate that CS provides improved ligand-protein docking fidelity when compared to individual docking platforms. This approach requires only a small number of docking combinations and can serve as a viable and parsimonious alternative to more computationally expensive docking approaches. Predictions from our CS algorithm are compared against independent machine learning evaluations using the same docking data, complementing the CS outcomes.

General recommendations have been recently released to guide the CNV interpretation based on predefined criteria to uniform the decision process. Several semiautomatic computational methods have been proposed to recommend appropriate choices, relieving clinicians of tedious searching in vast genomic databases. We have developed and evaluated such a tool called MarCNV and tested it on CNV records collected from the ClinVar database. Alternatively, the emerging machine learning-based tools, such as the recently published ISV (Interpretation of Structural Variants), showed promising ways of even fully automated predictions using broader characterization of affected genomic elements. Such tools utilize features additional to ACMG criteria, thus providing supporting evidence and the potential to improve CNV classification. Since both approaches contribute to evaluation of CNVs clinical impact, we propose a combined solution in the form of a decision support tool based on automated ACMG guidelines (MarCNV) supplemented by a machine learning-based pathogenicity prediction (ISV) for the classification of CNVs. We provide evidence that such a combined approach is able to reduce the number of uncertain classifications and reveal potentially incorrect classifications using automated guidelines.

As <i>Leishmania</i> lack a functional non-homologous DNA end joining pathway however, obtaining null mutants typically requires additional donor DNA, selection of drug resistance-associated edits or time-consuming isolation of clones. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens across different conditions and across multiple <i>Leishmania</i> species are therefore unfeasible at present. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 cytosine base editor (CBE) toolbox that overcomes these limitations. We employed CBEs in <i>Leishmania</i> to introduce STOP codons by converting cytosine into thymine and created http://www.leishbaseedit.net/ for CBE primer design in kinetoplastids. Through reporter assays and by targeting single- and multi-copy genes in <i>L. mexicana</i>, <i>L. major</i>, <i>L. donovani</i>, and <i>L. infantum</i>, we demonstrate how this tool can efficiently generate functional null mutants by expressing just one single-guide RNA, reaching up to 100% editing rate in non-clonal populations. We then generated a <i>Leishmania</i>-optimised CBE and successfully targeted an essential gene in a plasmid library delivered loss-of-function screen in <i>L. mexicana</i>.

A few closely related species, including Bordetella pertussis, are human pathogens that cause diseases such as whooping cough. Here, we present a large database of Bordetella isolates and genomes and develop genotyping systems for the genus and for the B. pertussis clade. To generate the database, we merge previously existing databases from Oxford University and Institut Pasteur, import genomes from public repositories, and add 83 newly sequenced B. bronchiseptica genomes. The public database currently includes 2582 Bordetella isolates and their provenance data, and 2085 genomes ( https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/bordetella/ ). We use core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) to develop genotyping systems for the whole genus and for B. pertussis, as well as specific schemes to define antigenic, virulence and macrolide resistance profiles. Phylogenetic analyses allow us to redefine evolutionary relationships among known Bordetella species, and to propose potential new species. Our database provides an expandable resource for genotyping of environmental and clinical Bordetella isolates, thus facilitating evolutionary and epidemiological research on whooping cough and other Bordetella infections.",True,False,4.0,,,,0.0,no_entities,,,,,,,True,3.0,False,False,https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/bordetella/,https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/bordetella/,True,"...tes and their provenance data, and 2085 genomes ( https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/bordetella/ ).
