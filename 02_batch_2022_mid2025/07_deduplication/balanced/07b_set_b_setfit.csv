38048333,HybridDBRpred: improved sequence-based prediction of DNA-binding amino acids using annotations from structured complexes and disordered proteins.,"Current predictors of DNA-binding residues (DBRs) from protein sequences belong to two distinct groups, those trained on binding annotations extracted from structured protein-DNA complexes (structure-trained) vs. intrinsically disordered proteins (disorder-trained). We complete the first empirical analysis of predictive performance across the structure- and disorder-annotated proteins for a representative collection of ten predictors. Majority of the structure-trained tools perform well on the structure-annotated proteins while doing relatively poorly on the disorder-annotated proteins, and vice versa. Several methods make accurate predictions for the structure-annotated proteins or the disorder-annotated proteins, but none performs highly accurately for both annotation types. Moreover, most predictors make excessive cross-predictions for the disorder-annotated proteins, where residues that interact with non-DNA ligand types are predicted as DBRs. Motivated by these results, we design, validate and deploy an innovative meta-model, hybridDBRpred, that uses deep transformer network to combine predictions generated by three best current predictors. HybridDBRpred provides accurate predictions and low levels of cross-predictions across the two annotation types, and is statistically more accurate than each of the ten tools and baseline meta-predictors that rely on averaging and logistic regression.

36988160,ProsmORF-pred: a machine learning-based method for the identification of small ORFs in prokaryotic genomes.,"Small open reading frames (smORFs) encoding proteins less than 100 amino acids (aa) are known to be important regulators of key cellular processes. However, their computational identification remains a challenge. Based on a comprehensive analysis of known prokaryotic small ORFs, we have developed the ProsmORF-pred resource which uses a machine learning (ML)-based method for prediction of smORFs in the prokaryotic genome sequences. ProsmORF-pred consists of two ML models, one for initiation site recognition in nucleic acid sequences upstream of putative start codons and the other uses translated amino acid sequences to decipher functional protein like sequences. The nucleotide sequence-based initiation site recognition model has been trained using longer ORFs (>100 aa) in the same genome while the ML model for identification of protein like sequences has been trained using annotated smORFs from Escherichia coli. Comprehensive benchmarking of ProsmORF-pred reveals that its performance is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches on the annotated smORF set derived from 32 prokaryotic genomes. Its performance is distinctly superior to other tools like PRODIGAL and RANSEPS for prediction of newly identified smORFs which have a length range of 10-30 aa, where prediction of smORFs has been a major challenge. Apart from identification of smORFs in genomic sequences, ProsmORF-pred can also aid in functional annotation of the predicted smORFs based on sequence similarity and genomic neighbourhood similarity searches in ProsmORFDB, a well-curated database of known smORFs.

We addressed varying label noise and feature space quality, utilizing artificial intelligence and advanced computing. Our method relies solely on openly available data streams and methods, eliminating training data acquisition or the need for additional expert knowledge for such purpose. We extracted land use labels from OpenStreetMap and remote sensing data to create a contiguous land use map of the European Union as of March 2020. OpenStreetMap tags were translated into land use labels, directly mapping 61.8% of the Union's area. These labels served as training data for a classification model, predicting land use in remaining areas.

39660955,SG-ML-PLAP: A structure-guided machine learning-based scoring function for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.,"Computational methods to predict binding affinity of protein-ligand complex have been used extensively to design inhibitors for proteins selected as drug targets. In recent years machine learning (ML) is being increasingly used for design of drugs/inhibitors. However, ranking compounds as per their experimental binding affinity has remained a major challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to develop ML-based scoring function (MLSF) for predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. In this work, protein-ligand interaction features, namely, extended connectivity interaction fingerprints (ECIF), derived from the PDBbind dataset have been used to build ML models for binding affinity prediction. The benchmarking has been done on the Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions (CASF) dataset and also by predicting the binding affinity of unseen protein-ligand complexes which have structural features different from those present in the training dataset. Furthermore, an improvement in the performance of MLSF on the redocked CASF complexes generated by AutoDock Vina software was seen when the training set consisting of crystal structures was supplemented with redocked protein-ligand complexes. The MLSF trained on crystal structures alone using a combination of ECIF and VINA features also predicted binding affinities of crystal as well as docked complexes with high accuracy. Overall, the MLSF developed in this work shows improved performance compared to conventional SFs and several other MLSFs. It will be a valuable resource for identifying novel inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening protocols.

Recent advances in synthetic biological technologies have accelerated the increase in the number and capacity of microbial cell factories; the variety and number of synthetic compounds produced via these cell factories have also grown substantially. However, no database is available that provides detailed information on the microbial cell factories and the synthesized compounds.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we established MCF2Chem, a manually curated knowledge base on the production of biosynthetic compounds using microbial cell factories. It contains 8888 items of production records related to 1231 compounds that were synthesizable by 590 microbial cell factories, including the production data of compounds (titer, yield, productivity, and content), strain culture information (culture medium, carbon source/precursor/substrate), fermentation information (mode, vessel, scale, and condition), and other information (e.g., strain modification method).

A key topic discussed was the frequent variability in results obtained between different microbial WGS-related AMR gene prediction workflows. Further, comparative benchmarking studies are difficult to perform due to differences in AMR gene prediction accuracy and a lack of agreement in the naming of AMR genes (semantic conformity) for the results obtained. To illustrate this problem, and as a capacity-building exercise to encourage stakeholder involvement, a comparative Galaxy-based BenchAMRking platform was developed and validated using datasets from bacterial species with PCR-verified AMR gene presence or absence information from abritAMR.<h4>Results</h4>The Galaxy-based BenchAMRking platform ( https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/benchAMRking/ ) specifically focusses on the steps involved in identifying AMR genes from raw reads and sequence assemblies. The platform currently comprises four well-characterised and published workflows that have previously been used to identify AMR genes using WGS data from several different bacterial species. These four workflows, which include the ISO certified abritAMR workflow, make use of different computational tools (or tool versions), and interrogate different AMR gene sequence databases. By utilising their own data, users can investigate potential AMR gene-calling problems associated with their own in silico workflows/protocols, with a potential use case outlined in this publication.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BenchAMRking is a Galaxy-based comparison platform where users can access, visualise, and explore some of the major discrepancies associated with AMR gene prediction from microbial WGS data.",False,True,,0.7073609,enchamrking,,16.95973957,ok,,benchamrking | joint programming initiative on antimicrobial resistance,,v2,0.95973957,BenchAMRking,False,0.0,False,False,https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/benchAMRking/,https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/benchAMRking/,True,...ults</h4>The Galaxy-based BenchAMRking platform ( https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/benchAMRking/ ) specifically focusses on the steps involved in...,1

39487448,The Amphibian Genomics Consortium: advancing genomic and genetic resources for amphibian research and conservation.,"Amphibians represent a diverse group of tetrapods, marked by deep divergence times between their three systematic orders and families. Studying amphibian biology through the genomics lens increases our understanding of the features of this animal class and that of other terrestrial vertebrates. The need for amphibian genomic resources is more urgent than ever due to the increasing threats to this group. Amphibians are one of the most imperiled taxonomic groups, with approximately 41% of species threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, changes in land use patterns, disease, climate change, and their synergistic effects. Amphibian genomic resources have provided a better understanding of ontogenetic diversity, tissue regeneration, diverse life history and reproductive modes, anti-predator strategies, and resilience and adaptive responses. They also serve as essential models for studying broad genomic traits, such as evolutionary genome expansions and contractions, as they exhibit the widest range of genome sizes among all animal taxa and possess multiple mechanisms of genetic sex determination. Despite these features, genome sequencing of amphibians has significantly lagged behind that of other vertebrates, primarily due to the challenges of assembling their large, repeat-rich genomes and the relative lack of societal support. The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, combined with advanced molecular and computational techniques that improve scaffolding and reduce computational workloads, is now making it possible to address some of these challenges. To promote and accelerate the production and use of amphibian genomics research through international coordination and collaboration, we launched the Amphibian Genomics Consortium (AGC, https://mvs.unimelb.edu.au/amphibian-genomics-consortium ) in early 2023. This burgeoning community already has more than 282 members from 41 countries. The AGC aims to leverage the diverse capabilities of its members to advance genomic resources for amphibians and bridge the implementation gap between biologists, bioinformaticians, and conservation practitioners.

EchinoDB is a database of genomic and transcriptomic data on echinoderms. The initial database consisted of groups of 749,397 orthologous and paralogous transcripts arranged in orthoclusters by sequence similarity.<h4>Results</h4>The updated version of EchinoDB includes two new major datasets: the RNA-Seq data of the brittle star Ophioderma brevispinum and the high-quality genomic assembly data of the green sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. In addition, we enabled keyword searches for annotated data and installed an updated version of Sequenceserver to allow Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches. The data are downloadable in FASTA format. The first version of EchinoDB appeared in 2016 and was implemented in GO on a local server. The new version has been updated using R Shiny to include new features and improvements in the application. Furthermore, EchinoDB now runs entirely in the cloud for increased reliability and scaling.<h4>Conclusion</h4>EchinoDB serves a user base drawn from the fields of phylogenetics, developmental biology, genomics, physiology, neurobiology, and regeneration. As use cases, we illustrate the function of EchinoDB in retrieving components of signaling pathways involved in the tissue regeneration process of different echinoderms, including the emerging model species Ophioderma brevispinum. Moreover, we use EchinoDB to shed light on the conservation of the molecular components involved in two echinoderm-specific phenomena: spicule matrix proteins involved in the formation of stereom endoskeleton and the tensilin protein that contributes to the capacity of the connective tissues to quickly change its mechanical properties. The genes involved in the former had been previously studied in echinoids, while gene sequences involved in the latter had been previously described in holothuroids. Specifically, we ask (a) if the biomineralization-related proteins previously reported only in sea urchins are also present in other, non-echinoid, echinoderms and (b) if tensilin, the protein responsible for the control of stiffness of the mutable collagenous tissue, previously described in sea cucumbers, is conserved across the phylum.",False,True,,0.71924114,chinodb,,16.8592423,ok,,echinodb,,v2,0.8592423,EchinoDB,True,1.0,False,False,https://echinodb.uncc.edu,https://echinodb.uncc.edu,True,"...elease a new version of EchinoDB, EchinoDB v2.0 ( https://echinodb.uncc.edu ).

37889037,SLKB: synthetic lethality knowledge base.,"Emerging CRISPR-Cas9 technology permits synthetic lethality (SL) screening of large number of gene pairs from gene combination double knockout (CDKO) experiments. However, the poor integration and annotation of CDKO SL data in current SL databases limit their utility, and diverse methods of calculating SL scores prohibit their comparison. To overcome these shortcomings, we have developed SL knowledge base (SLKB) that incorporates data of 11 CDKO experiments in 22 cell lines, 16,059 SL gene pairs and 264,424 non-SL gene pairs. Additionally, within SLKB, we have implemented five SL calculation methods: median score with and without background control normalization (Median-B/NB), sgRNA-derived score (sgRNA-B/NB), Horlbeck score, GEMINI score and MAGeCK score. The five scores have demonstrated a mere 1.21% overlap among their top 10% SL gene pairs, reflecting high diversity. Users can browse SL networks and assess the impact of scoring methods using Venn diagrams. The SL network generated from all data in SLKB shows a greater likelihood of SL gene pair connectivity with other SL gene pairs than non-SL pairs.

38757367,Mutual annotation-based prediction of protein domain functions with Domain2GO.,"Identifying unknown functional properties of proteins is essential for understanding their roles in both health and disease states. The domain composition of a protein can reveal critical information in this context, as domains are structural and functional units that dictate how the protein should act at the molecular level. The expensive and time-consuming nature of wet-lab experimental approaches prompted researchers to develop computational strategies for predicting the functions of proteins. In this study, we proposed a new method called Domain2GO that infers associations between protein domains and function-defining gene ontology (GO) terms, thus redefining the problem as domain function prediction. Domain2GO uses documented protein-level GO annotations together with proteins' domain annotations. Co-annotation patterns of domains and GO terms in the same proteins are examined using statistical resampling to obtain reliable associations. As a use-case study, we evaluated the biological relevance of examples selected from the Domain2GO-generated domain-GO term mappings via literature review. Then, we applied Domain2GO to predict unknown protein functions by propagating domain-associated GO terms to proteins annotated with these domains. For function prediction performance evaluation and comparison against other methods, we employed Critical Assessment of Function Annotation 3 (CAFA3) challenge datasets. The results demonstrated the high potential of Domain2GO, particularly for predicting molecular function and biological process terms, along with advantages such as producing interpretable results and having an exceptionally low computational cost. The approach presented here can be extended to other ontologies and biological entities to investigate unknown relationships in complex and large-scale biological data. The source code, datasets, results, and user instructions for Domain2GO are available at https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/Domain2GO.

34571541,Rossmann-toolbox: a deep learning-based protocol for the prediction and design of cofactor specificity in Rossmann fold proteins.,"The Rossmann fold enzymes are involved in essential biochemical pathways such as nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Their functioning relies on interaction with cofactors, small nucleoside-based compounds specifically recognized by a conserved βαβ motif shared by all Rossmann fold proteins. While Rossmann methyltransferases recognize only a single cofactor type, the S-adenosylmethionine, the oxidoreductases, depending on the family, bind nicotinamide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) or flavin-based (flavin adenine dinucleotide) cofactors. In this study, we showed that despite its short length, the βαβ motif unambiguously defines the specificity towards the cofactor. Following this observation, we trained two complementary deep learning models for the prediction of the cofactor specificity based on the sequence and structural features of the βαβ motif. A benchmark on two independent test sets, one containing βαβ motifs bearing no resemblance to those of the training set, and the other comprising 38 experimentally confirmed cases of rational design of the cofactor specificity, revealed the nearly perfect performance of the two methods.

37431591,Adding open spectral data to MassBank and PubChem using open source tools to support non-targeted exposomics of mixtures.,"The term ""exposome"" is defined as a comprehensive study of life-course environmental exposures and the associated biological responses. Humans are exposed to many different chemicals, which can pose a major threat to the well-being of humanity. Targeted or non-targeted mass spectrometry techniques are widely used to identify and characterize various environmental stressors when linking exposures to human health. However, identification remains challenging due to the huge chemical space applicable to exposomics, combined with the lack of sufficient relevant entries in spectral libraries. Addressing these challenges requires cheminformatics tools and database resources to share curated open spectral data on chemicals to improve the identification of chemicals in exposomics studies. This article describes efforts to contribute spectra relevant for exposomics to the open mass spectral library MassBank (https://www.massbank.eu) using various open source software efforts, including the R packages RMassBank and Shinyscreen. The experimental spectra were obtained from ten mixtures containing toxicologically relevant chemicals from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT). Following processing and curation, 5582 spectra from 783 of the 1268 ENTACT compounds were added to MassBank, and through this to other open spectral libraries (<i>e.g.</i>, MoNA, GNPS) for community benefit. Additionally, an automated deposition and annotation workflow was developed with PubChem to enable the display of all MassBank mass spectra in PubChem, which is rerun with each MassBank release.

The experimental identification of promoter sequences, pivotal for regulating gene expression, is a laborious and cost-prohibitive task. To expedite this, we introduce the Comprehensive Directory of Bacterial Promoters (CDBProm), a directory of <i>in-silico</i> predicted bacterial promoter sequences. We first identified that an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm would distinguish promoters from random downstream regions with an accuracy of 87%. To capture distinctive promoter signals, we generated a second XGBoost classifier trained on the instances misclassified in our first classifier. The predictor of CDBProm is then fed with over 55 million upstream regions from more than 6000 bacterial genomes. Upon finding potential promoter sequences in upstream regions, each promoter is mapped to the genomic data of the organism, linking the predicted promoter with its coding DNA sequence, and identifying the function of the gene regulated by the promoter.

This study involved compiling experimentally measured binding affinity (ΔG) values of 217 protein-RNA complexes and extracting numerous structure-based features, considering RNA, protein, and interactions between protein and RNA. Our findings indicate the significance of RNA base-step parameters, interaction energies, number of atomic contacts in the complex, hydrogen bonds, and contact potentials in understanding the binding affinity. Further, we observed that these factors are influenced by the type of RNA strand and the function of the protein in a protein-RNA complex. Multiple regression equations were developed for different classes of complexes to perform the prediction of the binding affinity between the protein and RNA.

36458799,NLM-Chem-BC7: manually annotated full-text resources for chemical entity annotation and indexing in biomedical articles.,"The automatic recognition of chemical names and their corresponding database identifiers in biomedical text is an important first step for many downstream text-mining applications. The task is even more challenging when considering the identification of these entities in the article's full text and, furthermore, the identification of candidate substances for that article's metadata [Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) article indexing]. The National Library of Medicine (NLM)-Chem track at BioCreative VII aimed to foster the development of algorithms that can predict with high quality the chemical entities in the biomedical literature and further identify the chemical substances that are candidates for article indexing. As a result of this challenge, the NLM-Chem track produced two comprehensive, manually curated corpora annotated with chemical entities and indexed with chemical substances: the chemical identification corpus and the chemical indexing corpus. The NLM-Chem BioCreative VII (NLM-Chem-BC7) Chemical Identification corpus consists of 204 full-text PubMed Central (PMC) articles, fully annotated for chemical entities by 12 NLM indexers for both span (i.e. named entity recognition) and normalization (i.e. entity linking) using MeSH. This resource was used for the training and testing of the Chemical Identification task to evaluate the accuracy of algorithms in predicting chemicals mentioned in recently published full-text articles. The NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus consists of 1333 recently published PMC articles, equipped with chemical substance indexing by manual experts at the NLM. This resource was used for the evaluation of the Chemical Indexing task, which evaluated the accuracy of algorithms in predicting the chemicals that should be indexed, i.e. appear in the listing of MeSH terms for the document. This set was further enriched after the challenge in two ways: (i) 11 NLM indexers manually verified each of the candidate terms appearing in the prediction results of the challenge participants, but not in the MeSH indexing, and the chemical indexing terms appearing in the MeSH indexing list, but not in the prediction results, and (ii) the challenge organizers algorithmically merged the chemical entity annotations in the full text for all predicted chemical entities and used a statistical approach to keep those with the highest degree of confidence. As a result, the NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus is a gold-standard corpus for chemical indexing of journal articles and a silver-standard corpus for chemical entity identification in full-text journal articles. Together, these resources are currently the most comprehensive resources for chemical entity recognition, and we demonstrate improvements in the chemical entity recognition algorithms.

35148686,ProtPlat: an efficient pre-training platform for protein classification based on FastText.,"<h4>Background</h4>For the past decades, benefitting from the rapid growth of protein sequence data in public databases, a lot of machine learning methods have been developed to predict physicochemical properties or functions of proteins using amino acid sequence features. However, the prediction performance often suffers from the lack of labeled data. In recent years, pre-training methods have been widely studied to address the small-sample issue in computer vision and natural language processing fields, while specific pre-training techniques for protein sequences are few.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we propose a pre-training platform for representing protein sequences, called ProtPlat, which uses the Pfam database to train a three-layer neural network, and then uses specific training data from downstream tasks to fine-tune the model. ProtPlat can learn good representations for amino acids, and at the same time achieve efficient classification. We conduct experiments on three protein classification tasks, including the identification of type III secreted effectors, the prediction of subcellular localization, and the recognition of signal peptides. The experimental results show that the pre-training can enhance model performance effectively and ProtPlat is competitive to the state-of-the-art predictors, especially for small datasets. We implement the ProtPlat platform as a web service ( https://compbio.sjtu.edu.cn/protplat ) that is accessible to the public.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To enhance the feature representation of protein amino acid sequences and improve the performance of sequence-based classification tasks, we develop ProtPlat, a general platform for the pre-training of protein sequences, which is featured by a large-scale supervised training based on Pfam database and an efficient learning model, FastText.

39360619,PDCdb: the biological activity and pharmaceutical information of peptide-drug conjugate (PDC).,"Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted therapeutics with substantial pharmaceutical advantages and market potentials, which is a combination of a peptide (selective to the disease-relevant target), a linker (stable in circulation but cleavable at target site) and a cytotoxic/radioactive drug (efficacious/traceable for disease). Among existing PDCs, those based on radiopharmaceuticals (a.k.a. radioactive drugs) are valued due to their accurate imaging and targeted destruction of disease sites. It's demanded to accumulate the biological activity and pharmaceutical information of PDCs. Herein, a database PDCdb was thus constructed to systematically describe these valuable data. Particularly, biological activities for 2036 PDCs were retrieved from literatures, which resulted in 1684, 613 and 2753 activity data generated based on clinical trial, animal model and cell line, respectively. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical information for all 2036 PDCs was collected, which gave the diverse data of (a) ADME property, plasma half-life and administration approach of a PDC and (b) chemical modification, primary target, mode of action, conjugating feature of the constituent peptide/linker/drug. In sum, PDCdb systematically provided the biological activities and pharmaceutical information for the most comprehensive list of PDCs among the available databases, which was expected to attract broad interest from related communities and could be freely accessible at: https://idrblab.org/PDCdb/.",False,True,,0.6544542,,pdcdb,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,PDCdb,True,1.0,True,True,https://idrblab.org/PDCdb/,https://idrblab.org/PDCdb/,True,...ed communities and could be freely accessible at: https://idrblab.org/PDCdb/.,1
35264663,GOntoSim: a semantic similarity measure based on LCA and common descendants.,"The Gene Ontology (GO) is a controlled vocabulary that captures the semantics or context of an entity based on its functional role. Biomedical entities are frequently compared to each other to find similarities to help in data annotation and knowledge transfer. In this study, we propose GOntoSim, a novel method to determine the functional similarity between genes. GOntoSim quantifies the similarity between pairs of GO terms, by taking the graph structure and the information content of nodes into consideration. Our measure quantifies the similarity between the ancestors of the GO terms accurately. It also takes into account the common children of the GO terms. GOntoSim is evaluated using the entire Enzyme Dataset containing 10,890 proteins and 97,544 GO annotations. The enzymes are clustered and compared with the Gold Standard EC numbers. At level 1 of the EC Numbers for Molecular Function, GOntoSim achieves a purity score of 0.75 as compared to 0.47 and 0.51 GOGO and Wang. GOntoSim can handle the noisy IEA annotations. We achieve a purity score of 0.94 in contrast to 0.48 for both GOGO and Wang at level 1 of the EC Numbers with IEA annotations.

38427684,CRISPRals: A Web Database for Assessing the CRISPR Defense System in the <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> Species Complex to Avoid Phage Resistance.,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) has been widely characterized as a defense system against phages and other invading elements in bacteria and archaea. A low percentage of <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> species complex (RSSC) strains possess the CRISPR array and the CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) that would confer immunity against various phages. To provide a wide-range screen of the CRISPR presence in the RSSC, we analyzed 378 genomes of RSSC strains to find the CRISPR locus. We found that 20.1, 14.3, and 54.5% of the <i>R. solanacearum</i>, <i>R. pseudosolanacearum</i>, and <i>R. syzygii</i> strains, respectively, possess the CRISPR locus. In addition, we performed further analysis to identify the respective phages that are restricted by the CRISPR arrays. We found 252 different phages infecting different strains of the RSSC, by means of the identification of similarities between the protospacers in phages and spacers in bacteria. We compiled this information in a database with web access called CRISPRals (https://crisprals.yachaytech.edu.ec/). Additionally, we made available a number of tools to detect and identify CRISPR array and Cas genes in genomic sequences that could be uploaded by users. Finally, a matching tool to relate bacteria spacer with phage protospacer sequences is available.

36330927,QTLbase2: an enhanced catalog of human quantitative trait loci on extensive molecular phenotypes.,"Deciphering the fine-scale molecular mechanisms that shape the genetic effects at disease-associated loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains challenging. The key avenue is to identify the essential molecular phenotypes that mediate the causal variant and disease under particular biological conditions. Therefore, integrating GWAS signals with context-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (such as different tissue/cell types, disease states, and perturbations) from extensive molecular phenotypes would present important strategies for full understanding of disease genetics. Via persistent curation and systematic data processing of large-scale human molecular trait QTLs (xQTLs), we updated our previous QTLbase database (now QTLbase2, http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase) to comprehensively analyze and visualize context-specific QTLs across 22 molecular phenotypes and over 95 tissue/cell types.

37822561,ASCARIS: Positional feature annotation and protein structure-based representation of single amino acid variations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genomic variations may cause deleterious effects on protein functionality and perturb biological processes. Elucidating the effects of variations is critical for developing novel treatment strategies for diseases of genetic origin. Computational approaches have been aiding the work in this field by modeling and analyzing the mutational landscape. However, new approaches are required, especially for accurate representation and data-centric analysis of sequence variations.<h4>Method</h4>In this study, we propose ASCARIS (Annotation and StruCture-bAsed RepresentatIon of Single amino acid variations), a method for the featurization (i.e., quantitative representation) of single amino acid variations (SAVs), which could be used for a variety of purposes, such as predicting their functional effects or building multi-omics-based integrative models. ASCARIS utilizes the direct and spatial correspondence between the location of the SAV on the sequence/structure and 30 different types of positional feature annotations (e.g., active/lipidation/glycosylation sites; calcium/metal/DNA binding, inter/transmembrane regions, etc.), along with structural features and physicochemical properties. The main novelty of this method lies in constructing reusable numerical representations of SAVs via functional annotations.<h4>Results</h4>We statistically analyzed the relationship between these features and the consequences of variations and found that each carries information in this regard. To investigate potential applications of ASCARIS, we trained variant effect prediction models that utilize our SAV representations as input. We carried out an ablation study and a comparison against the state-of-the-art methods and observed that ASCARIS has a competing and complementary performance against widely-used predictors. ASCARIS can be used alone or in combination with other approaches to represent SAVs from a functional perspective.

37691964,Comprehensive regulatory networks for tomato organ development based on the genome and RNAome of MicroTom tomato.,"MicroTom has a short growth cycle and high transformation efficiency, and is a prospective model plant for studying organ development, metabolism, and plant-microbe interactions. Here, with a newly assembled reference genome for this tomato cultivar and abundant RNA-seq data derived from tissues of different organs/developmental stages/treatments, we constructed multiple gene co-expression networks, which will provide valuable clues for the identification of important genes involved in diverse regulatory pathways during plant growth, e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and fruit development. Additionally, non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were also identified, together with their potential targets. Interacting networks between different types of non-coding RNAs (miRNA-lncRNA), and non-coding RNAs and genes (miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-mRNA) were constructed as well. Our results and data will provide valuable information for the study of organ differentiation and development of this important fruit. Lastly, we established a database (http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase/) with genomic and transcriptomic data, as well as details of gene co-expression and interacting networks on MicroTom, and this database should be of great value to those who want to adopt MicroTom as a model plant for research.",False,True,,0.70319647,microtom,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase/,http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase/,True,"...portant fruit.

37037149,REL-NPMI: Exploring genotype and phenotype relationship of pancreatitis based on improved normalized point-by-point mutual information.,"Pancreatitis is a relatively serious disease caused by the self-digestion of trypsin in the pancreas. The generation of diseases is closely related to gene and phenotype information. Generally, gene-phenotype relations are mainly obtained through clinical experiments, but the cost is huge. With the amount of published biomedical literature increasing exponentially, it carries a wealth of disease-related gene and phenotype information. This study provided an effective way to obtain disease-related gene and phenotype information. To our best knowledge, this work first attempted to explore relationships between genotype and phenotype about the pancreatitis from the computational perspective. It mined 6152 genes and 76,753 pairs of genotype and phenotype extracted from the biomedical literature about pancreatitis using text mining. Based on the above 76,753 pairs, the study proposed an improved normalized point-wise mutual information (REL-NPMI) model to optimize gene-phenotype relations related to pancreatitis, and obtained 12,562 gene-phenotype pairs which may be related to pancreatitis. The extracted top 20 results were validated and evaluated. The experimental results show that the method is promising for exploring pancreatitis' molecular mechanism, thus it provides a computational way for studying pancreatitis' disease pathogenesis.

39380496,MicroEpitope: an atlas of immune epitopes derived from cancer microbiomes.,"The majority of human cancers harbor molecular evidence of intratumoral microbiota. Microbiota-derived epitopes as molecular mimics of tumor antigens can bind human leukocyte antigen (HLA), thereby modulating host immunity. However, many questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the interactions between microbiota and the host's immune system in cancer. Here, MicroEpitope (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/MicroEpitope) was developed to provide and analyze the atlas of microbiota-derived epitopes in cancer. We manually collected available mass spectrometry (MS)-based HLA immunopeptidomes of 1190 samples across 24 cancer types. Alignment was performed against an in-house constructed theoretical library of human and intratumor microbiome encoded proteins, including 1298 bacterial and 124 viral species. Currently, MicroEpitope contains 51 497 bacteria and 767 virus-derived epitopes, mainly originating from Bacillus subtilis, Buchnera aphidicola and human cytomegalovirus. The common immunogenic features of epitopes were calculated, as well as their biochemical properties and the clinical relevance of corresponding bacteria and viruses across cancers. MicroEpitope also provides five analytical tools, and multiple visualization methods to facilitate understanding of the roles of microbiota-derived epitopes in cancer immunity.

The AgBioData Consortium (https://www.agbiodata.org/) currently represents 44 databases and resources (https://www.agbiodata.org/databases) covering model or crop plant and animal GGB data, ontologies, pathways, genetic variation and breeding platforms (referred to as 'databases' throughout). One of the goals of the Consortium is to facilitate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management and the integration of datasets which requires data sharing, along with structured vocabularies and/or ontologies. Two AgBioData working groups, focused on Data Sharing and Ontologies, respectively, conducted a Consortium-wide survey to assess the current status and future needs of the members in those areas. A total of 33 researchers responded to the survey, representing 37 databases. Results suggest that data-sharing practices by AgBioData databases are in a fairly healthy state, but it is not clear whether this is true for all metadata and data types across all databases; and that, ontology use has not substantially changed since a similar survey was conducted in 2017. Based on our evaluation of the survey results, we recommend (i) providing training for database personnel in a specific data-sharing techniques, as well as in ontology use; (ii) further study on what metadata is shared, and how well it is shared among databases; (iii) promoting an understanding of data sharing and ontologies in the stakeholder community; (iv) improving data sharing and ontologies for specific phenotypic data types and formats; and (v) lowering specific barriers to data sharing and ontology use, by identifying sustainability solutions, and the identification, promotion, or development of data standards.

The main challenge lies in accurately mapping these mutations to protein structures and analysing their effects on protein function. To address this, Mut-Map (https://genemutation.org/) is a comprehensive computational pipeline designed to integrate mutation data from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer database with protein structural data from the Protein Data Bank and AlphaFold models. The pipeline begins by taking a UniProt ID and proceeds through mapping corresponding Protein Data Bank structures, renumbering residues, and assessing disorder percentages. It then overlays mutation data, categorizes mutations based on structural context, and visualizes them using advanced tools like MolStar. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of how mutations may disrupt protein function by affecting key regions such as DNA interfaces, ligand-binding sites, and dimer interactions. To validate the pipeline, a case study on the TP53 gene, a critical tumour suppressor often mutated in cancers, was conducted. The analysis highlighted the most frequent mutations occurring at the DNA-binding interface, providing insights into their potential role in cancer progression.

Taking advantage of this property, we recently developed the SCINPAS workflow to infer polyadenylation sites (PASs) from scRNA-seq data. Here, we used this workflow to construct version 3.0 (v3.0, https://polyasite.unibas.ch/) of the PolyASite Atlas from a big compendium of publicly available human, mouse and worm scRNA-seq datasets obtained from healthy tissues. As the resolution of scRNA-seq was too low for robust detection of cell-level differences in PAS usage, we aggregated samples based on their tissue-of-origin to construct tissue-level catalogs of PASs. These provide qualitatively new information about PAS usage, in comparison to the previous PAS catalogs that were based on bulk 3' end sequencing experiments primarily in cell lines. In the new version, we document stringency levels associated with each PAS so that users can balance sensitivity and specificity in their analysis. We also upgraded the integration with the UCSC Genome Browser and developed track hubs conveniently displaying pooled and tissue-specific expression of PASs.",False,True,,0.7026774,polyasite,,16.0,ok,,ucsc genome browser,scinpas,spacy,0.0,PolyASite,False,0.0,True,False,https://polyasite.unibas.ch/,https://polyasite.unibas.ch/,True,"...sed this workflow to construct version 3.0 (v3.0, https://polyasite.unibas.ch/) of the PolyASite Atlas from a big compendium of...",1
34664659,NPCDR: natural product-based drug combination and its disease-specific molecular regulation.,"Natural product (NP) has a long history in promoting modern drug discovery, which has derived or inspired a large number of currently prescribed drugs. Recently, the NPs have emerged as the ideal candidates to combine with other therapeutic strategies to deal with the persistent challenge of conventional therapy, and the molecular regulation mechanism underlying these combinations is crucial for the related communities. Thus, it is urgently demanded to comprehensively provide the disease-specific molecular regulation data for various NP-based drug combinations. However, no database has been developed yet to describe such valuable information. In this study, a newly developed database entitled 'Natural Product-based Drug Combination and Its Disease-specific Molecular Regulation (NPCDR)' was thus introduced. This database was unique in (a) providing the comprehensive information of NP-based drug combinations & describing their clinically or experimentally validated therapeutic effect, (b) giving the disease-specific molecular regulation data for a number of NP-based drug combinations, (c) fully referencing all NPs, drugs, regulated molecules/pathways by cross-linking them to the available databases describing their biological or pharmaceutical characteristics. Therefore, NPCDR is expected to have great implications for the future practice of network pharmacology, medical biochemistry, drug design, and medicinal chemistry.

Here, we used the latest improved telomere-to-telomere assembly of the model pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to lift over the gene models from Phatr3, a previously annotated reference genome. We used the lifted genes annotation and newly published transposable elements to map the epigenome landscape, namely DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histones.

40645675,MDDB: A public databank of host microRNAs in Tuberculosis diagnosis.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge due to its high mortality rate. Several factors contribute significantly including delayed diagnosis, emergence of drug resistance, and biofilm formation. Although various diagnostic methods are available for TB, such as sputum smear microscopy, culture techniques, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). They have notable limitations, including false positives and negatives, timeliness, and high cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an early and accurate diagnostic approach to control the infection. MicroRNA (miRNA)-based diagnostics have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the potential for earlier detection and reduced false-positivity. However, this field is still in development and requires specialized tools to accelerate miRNA research, streamline the process, and facilitate the creation of innovative diagnostic methods. To address this need, the MicroRNA Disease Databank (MDDB) was developed as a centralized platform providing extensive miRNA-related information. Freely accessible at https://mddb.nitrr.ac.in/., MDDB offers comprehensive details on miRNA locations, associated disease characteristics, probe sequences, and molecular mechanisms. This resource aims to support the development of novel miRNA-based diagnostic biomarkers.

38630617,RNAscape: geometric mapping and customizable visualization of RNA structure.,"Analyzing and visualizing the tertiary structure and complex interactions of RNA is essential for being able to mechanistically decipher their molecular functions in vivo. Secondary structure visualization software can portray many aspects of RNA; however, these layouts are often unable to preserve topological correspondence since they do not consider tertiary interactions between different regions of an RNA molecule. Likewise, quaternary interactions between two or more interacting RNA molecules are not considered in secondary structure visualization tools. The RNAscape webserver produces visualizations that can preserve topological correspondence while remaining both visually intuitive and structurally insightful. RNAscape achieves this by designing a mathematical structural mapping algorithm which prioritizes the helical segments, reflecting their tertiary organization. Non-helical segments are mapped in a way that minimizes structural clutter. RNAscape runs a plotting script that is designed to generate publication-quality images. RNAscape natively supports non-standard nucleotides, multiple base-pairing annotation styles and requires no programming experience. RNAscape can also be used to analyze RNA/DNA hybrid structures and DNA topologies, including G-quadruplexes.

36484479,Emati: a recommender system for biomedical literature based on supervised learning.,"The scientific literature continues to grow at an ever-increasing rate. Considering that thousands of new articles are published every week, it is obvious how challenging it is to keep up with newly published literature on a regular basis. Using a recommender system that improves the user experience in the online environment can be a solution to this problem. In the present study, we aimed to develop a web-based article recommender service, called Emati. Since the data are text-based by nature and we wanted our system to be independent of the number of users, a content-based approach has been adopted in this study. A supervised machine learning model has been proposed to generate article recommendations. Two different supervised learning approaches, namely the naïve Bayes model with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer and the state-of-the-art language model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), have been implemented. In the first one, a list of documents is converted into TF-IDF-weighted features and fed into a classifier to distinguish relevant articles from irrelevant ones. Multinomial naïve Bayes algorithm is used as a classifier since, along with the class label, it also gives the probability that the input belongs to this class. The second approach is based on fine-tuning the pretrained state-of-the-art language model BERT for the text classification task. Emati provides a weekly updated list of article recommendations and presents it to the user, sorted by probability scores. New article recommendations are also sent to users' email addresses on a weekly basis. Additionally, Emati has a personalized search feature to search online services' (such as PubMed and arXiv) content and have the results sorted by the user's classifier.

40400348,AcrDB update: Predicted 3D structures of anti-CRISPRs in human gut viromes.,"Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins play a key role in phage-host interactions and hold great promise for advancing genome-editing technologies. However, finding new Acrs has been challenging due to their low sequence similarity. Recent advances in protein structure prediction have opened new pathways for Acr discovery by using 3D structure similarity. This study presents an updated AcrDB, with the following new features not available in other databases: (1) predicted Acrs from human gut virome databases, (2) Acr structures predicted by AlphaFold2, (3) a structural similarity search function to allow users to submit new sequences and structures to search against 3D structures of experimentally known Acrs. The updated AcrDB contains predicted 3D structures of 795 candidate Acrs with structural similarity (TM-score ≥0.7) to known Acrs supported by at least two of the three non-sequence similarity-based tools (TM-Vec, Foldseek, AcrPred). Among these candidate Acrs, 121 are supported by all three tools. AcrDB also includes 3D structures of 122 experimentally characterized Acr proteins. The 121 most confident candidate Acrs were combined with the 122 known Acrs and clustered into 163 sequence similarity-based Acr families. The 163 families were further subject to a structure similarity-based hierarchical clustering, revealing structural similarity between 44 candidate Acr (cAcr) families and 119 known Acr families. The bacterial hosts of these 163 Acr families are mainly from Bacillota, Pseudomonadota, and Bacteroidota, which are all dominant gut bacterial phyla.

However, many of the available information about human allele frequencies, and about clinical drug-gene interactions, is based on American and European populations. PharmaKoVariome database was constructed to support genetic testing for safe prescription and drug development. It consolidated and stored 2507 diseases, 11 459 drugs and 61 627 drug-target or druggable genes from public databases. PharmaKoVariome precomputed ethnic-specific abundant variants for approximately 120 M single-nucleotide variants of drug-target or druggable genes. A user can search by gene symbol, drug name, disease and reference SNP ID number (rsID) to statistically analyse the frequency of ethnical variations, such as odds ratio and P-values for related genes. In an example study, we observed five Korean-enriched variants in the CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 genes, one of which (rs1065852) is known to be incapable of metabolizing drug. It is also shown that 4-6% of North and East Asians have risk factors for drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 gene.

Some of the most important bacteria have been purposely engineered to produce commercial quantities of antibiotics and therapeutics, and non-classical secretion systems are at the forefront of these technologies. Unlike the classical Sec or Tat pathways, non-classically secreted proteins share few common characteristics and use much more diverse secretion pathways for protein transport. Systematically categorizing and investigating the non-classically secreted proteins will enable a deeper understanding of their associated secretion mechanisms and provide a landscape of the Gram-positive secretion pathway distribution. We therefore developed PncsHub (https://pncshub.erc.monash.edu/), the first universal platform for comprehensively annotating and analyzing Gram-positive bacterial non-classically secreted proteins. PncsHub catalogs 4,914 non-classically secreted proteins, which are delicately categorized into 8 subtypes (including the 'unknown' subtype) and annotated with data compiled from up to 26 resources and visualisation tools.

We provide a bird's eye view of studies that interpreted their findings in light of at least one of four leading neuroscientific theories of consciousness (N = 412 experiments), asking how methodological choices of the researchers might affect the final conclusions. We found that supporting a specific theory can be predicted solely from methodological choices, irrespective of findings.

37566638,Practical sampling of constraint-based models: Optimized thinning boosts CHRR performance.,"Thinning is a sub-sampling technique to reduce the memory footprint of Markov chain Monte Carlo. Despite being commonly used, thinning is rarely considered efficient. For sampling constraint-based models, a highly relevant use-case in systems biology, we here demonstrate that thinning boosts computational and, thereby, sampling efficiencies of the widely used Coordinate Hit-and-Run with Rounding (CHRR) algorithm. By benchmarking CHRR with thinning with simplices and genome-scale metabolic networks of up to thousands of dimensions, we find a substantial increase in computational efficiency compared to unthinned CHRR, in our examples by orders of magnitude, as measured by the effective sample size per time (ESS/t), with performance gains growing with polytope (effective network) dimension. Using a set of benchmark models we derive a ready-to-apply guideline for tuning thinning to efficient and effective use of compute resources without requiring additional coding effort. Our guideline is validated using three (out-of-sample) large-scale networks and we show that it allows sampling convex polytopes uniformly to convergence in a fraction of time, thereby unlocking the rigorous investigation of hitherto intractable models. The derivation of our guideline is explained in detail, allowing future researchers to update it as needed as new model classes and more training data becomes available. CHRR with deliberate utilization of thinning thereby paves the way to keep pace with progressing model sizes derived with the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) tool set.

The Mondo ontology initiative allows a standardization of the disease name into specific codes, making it possible a computational association between genes, variants, diseases, and their effects on biological processes. Here, we tackle the problem of which biological processes enzymes can affect when the protein variant is disease-associated. We adopt Reactome to describe human biological processes, and by mapping disease-associated enzymes in the Reactome pathways, we establish a Reactome-disease association. This allows a novel categorization of human monogenic and polygenic diseases based on Reactome pathways and reactions. Our analysis aims at dissecting the complexity of the human genetic disease universe, highlighting all the possible links within diseases and Reactome pathways. The novel mapping helps understanding the biochemical/molecular biology of the disease and allows a direct glimpse on the present knowledge of other molecules involved.

Machine learning (ML) approaches are helpful in minimizing the experimentations and find vast applications in RPP. However, these ML-based tools primarily focus on features with respect to amino-acid-sequence, ruling out the influence of fermentation process conditions. The present study combines the features derived from fermentation process conditions with that from amino acid-sequence to construct an ML-based model that predicts the maximal protein yields and the corresponding fermentation conditions for the expression of target recombinant protein in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> periplasm. Two sets of XGBoost classifiers were employed in the first stage to classify the expression levels of the target protein as high (>50 mg/L), medium (between 0.5 and 50 mg/L), or low (<0.5 mg/L). The second-stage framework consisted of three regression models involving support vector machines and random forest to predict the expression yields corresponding to each expression-level-class. Independent tests showed that the predictor achieved an overall average accuracy of 75% and a Pearson coefficient correlation of 0.91 for the correctly classified instances. Therefore, our model offers a reliable substitution of numerous trial-and-error experiments to identify the optimal fermentation conditions and yield for RPP.

39198545,Emotional palette: a computational mapping of aesthetic experiences evoked by visual art.,"Despite the evolutionary history and cultural significance of visual art, the structure of aesthetic experiences it evokes has only attracted recent scientific attention. What kinds of experience does visual art evoke? Guided by Semantic Space Theory, we identify the concepts that most precisely describe people's aesthetic experiences using new computational techniques. Participants viewed 1457 artworks sampled from diverse cultural and historical traditions and reported on the emotions they felt and their perceived artwork qualities. Results show that aesthetic experiences are high-dimensional, comprising 25 categories of feeling states. Extending well beyond hedonism and broad evaluative judgments (e.g., pleasant/unpleasant), aesthetic experiences involve emotions of daily social living (e.g., ""sad"", ""joy""), the imagination (e.g., ""psychedelic"", ""mysterious""), profundity (e.g., ""disgust"", ""awe""), and perceptual qualities attributed to the artwork (e.g., ""whimsical"", ""disorienting""). Aesthetic emotions and perceptual qualities jointly predict viewers' liking of the artworks, indicating that we conceptualize aesthetic experiences in terms of the emotions we feel but also the qualities we perceive in the artwork.

Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of simulation in radiological perception training. This study aimed to develop and make available a pure web-based application called <i>Perception Trainer</i> for perception training in lung nodule detection in chest X-rays.<h4>Methods</h4>Based on open-access data, we trained a deep-learning model for lung segmentation in chest X-rays. Subsequently, an algorithm for artificial lung nodule generation was implemented and combined with the segmentation model to allow on-the-fly procedural insertion of lung nodules in chest X-rays. This functionality was integrated into an existing zero-footprint web-based DICOM viewer, and a dynamic HTML page was created to specify case generation parameters.<h4>Results</h4>The result is an easily accessible platform-agnostic web application available at: https://castlemountain.dk/mulrecon/perceptionTrainer.html.The application allows the user to specify the characteristics of lung nodules to be inserted into chest X-rays, and it produces automated feedback regarding nodule detection performance. Generated cases can be shared through a uniform resource locator.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We anticipate that the description and availability of our developed solution with open-sourced codes may help facilitate radiological education and stimulate the development of similar AI-augmented educational tools.<h4>Advances in knowledge</h4>A web-based application applying AI-based techniques for radiological perception training was developed.

We then construct a digitalized genotyping CNVb map across 1599 global wheat accessions. Key CNVb markers are linked with trait-associated introgressions, such as the 1RS·1BL translocation and 2N<sup>v</sup>S translocation, and the beneficial alleles, such as the end-use quality allele Glu-D1d (Dx5 + Dy10) and the semi-dwarf r-e-z allele. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these tagged CNVb markers promote a stable and cost-effective strategy for evaluating wheat germplasm resources with ultra-low-coverage sequencing data, competing with SNP array for applications such as evaluating new varieties, efficient management of collections in gene banks, and describing wheat germplasm resources in a digitalized manner. We also develop a user-friendly interactive platform, WheatCNVb ( http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/WheatCNVb/ ), for exploring the CNVb profiles over ever-increasing wheat accessions, and also propose a QR-code-like representation of individual digital CNVb fingerprint.

In the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the topological properties of such a network are well-described (distribution of degrees, hierarchical levels, organization in network motifs, etc.). To go further on this, our aim was to search for additional information resulting from the new combination of classical representations of transcriptional regulatory networks with more realistic models of the spatial organization of S. cerevisiae genome in the nucleus.<h4>Results</h4>Taking advantage of independent studies with high-quality datasets, i.e. lists of target genes for specific transcription factors and chromosome positions in a three dimensional space representing the nucleus, particular spatial co-localizations of genes that shared common regulatory mechanisms were searched. All transcriptional modules of S. cerevisiae, as described in the latest release of the YEASTRACT database were analyzed and significant biases toward co-localization for a few sets of target genes were observed.

38834718,A novel framework based on explainable AI and genetic algorithms for designing neurological medicines.,"The advent of the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by artificial intelligence (AI) as its central component, has resulted in the mechanization of numerous previously labor-intensive activities. The use of in silico tools has become prevalent in the design of biopharmaceuticals. Upon conducting a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of many organisms, it has been discovered that their tissues can generate specific peptides that confer protection against certain diseases. This study aims to identify a selected group of neuropeptides (NPs) possessing favorable characteristics that render them ideal for production as neurological biopharmaceuticals. Until now, the construction of NP classifiers has been the primary focus, neglecting to optimize these characteristics. Therefore, in this study, the task of creating ideal NPs has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed framework, NPpred, comprises two distinct components: NSGA-NeuroPred and BERT-NeuroPred. The former employs the NSGA-II algorithm to explore and change a population of NPs, while the latter is an interpretable deep learning-based model.

39658207,Augmenting small biomedical datasets using generative AI methods based on self-organizing neural networks.,"Small sample sizes in biomedical research often led to poor reproducibility and challenges in translating findings into clinical applications. This problem stems from limited study resources, rare diseases, ethical considerations in animal studies, costly expert diagnosis, and others. As a contribution to the problem, we propose a novel generative algorithm based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) to computationally increase sample sizes. The proposed unsupervised generative algorithm uses neural networks to detect inherent structure even in small multivariate datasets, distinguishing between sparse ""void"" and dense ""cloud"" regions. Using emergent SOMs (ESOMs), the algorithm adapts to high-dimensional data structures and generates for each original data point k new points by randomly selecting positions within an adapted hypersphere with distances based on valid neighborhood probabilities. Experiments on artificial and biomedical (omics) datasets show that the generated data preserve the original structure without introducing artifacts. Random forests and support vector machines cannot distinguish between generated and original data, and the variables of original and generated data sets are not statistically different. The method successfully augments small group sizes, such as transcriptomics data from a rare form of leukemia and lipidomics data from arthritis research. The novel ESOM-based generative algorithm presents a promising solution for enhancing sample sizes in small or rare case datasets, even when limited training data are available. This approach can address challenges associated with small sample sizes in biomedical research, offering a tool for improving the reliability and robustness of scientific findings in this field.

Binarization plays an important role in quantitative analysis of eye with optical coherence tomography. To address the problem of few training samples and contrast-limited scene, we proposed a new binarization framework with specific-patch SVM (SPSVM) for low-intensity OCT image, which is open and classification-based framework. This new framework contains two phases: training model and binarization threshold. In the training phase, firstly, the patches of target and background from few training samples are extracted as the ROI and the background, respectively. Then, PCA is conducted on all patches to reduce the dimension and learn the eigenvector subspace. Finally, the classification model is trained from the features of patches to get the target value of different patches. In the testing phase, the learned eigenvector subspace is conducted on the pixels of each patch. The binarization threshold of patch is obtained with the learned SVM model.

However, despite continued discovery of new protein structures to date, the Ramachandran plot is still constructed by only a small number of data points, and further it cannot reflect the steric information of proteins. Here, we investigated the secondary structure of proteins in terms of static and dynamic characteristics. As for static feature, the Ramachandran plot was revisited for the dataset consisting of 9,148 non-redundant high-resolution protein structures released in the protein data bank until April 1, 2022. By calculating amino acid propensities, it was found that the proportion of secondary structures with respect to residue depth is directly related to their hydrophobicity. As for dynamic feature, normal mode analysis (NMA) based on an elastic network model (ENM) was carried out for the dataset using our KOSMOS web server (http://bioengineering.skku.ac.kr/kosmos/). All ENM-based NMA results were stored in the KOSMOS database, allowing researchers to use them in various ways. In this process, it was commonly found that high B-factors appeared at the edge of the alpha helix region, which was elucidated by introducing residue depth. In addition, by investigating the change in dihedral angle, it was possible to quantitatively survey the contribution of structural change of protein on the Ramachandran plot.

36920090,Inter-domain distance prediction based on deep learning for domain assembly.,"AlphaFold2 achieved a breakthrough in protein structure prediction through the end-to-end deep learning method, which can predict nearly all single-domain proteins at experimental resolution. However, the prediction accuracy of full-chain proteins is generally lower than that of single-domain proteins because of the incorrect interactions between domains. In this work, we develop an inter-domain distance prediction method, named DeepIDDP. In DeepIDDP, we design a neural network with attention mechanisms, where two new inter-domain features are used to enhance the ability to capture the interactions between domains. Furthermore, we propose a data enhancement strategy termed DPMSA, which is employed to deal with the absence of co-evolutionary information on targets. We integrate DeepIDDP into our previously developed domain assembly method SADA, termed SADA-DeepIDDP. Tested on a given multi-domain benchmark dataset, the accuracy of SADA-DeepIDDP inter-domain distance prediction is 11.3% and 21.6% higher than trRosettaX and trRosetta, respectively. The accuracy of the domain assembly model is 2.5% higher than that of SADA. Meanwhile, we reassemble 68 human multi-domain protein models with TM-score ≤ 0.80 from the AlphaFold protein structure database, where the average TM-score is improved by 11.8% after the reassembly by our method.

However, high-throughput data detailing the effect of CAP on cancer cells is lacking, let alone the corresponding database and analytical tool. Here, we sequenced the whole transcriptome, proteome, phosphorylome, acetylome, and lactylome of transformed cells in response to CAP using breast cancer cells as the disease model; and advanced our previously developed Hiplot platform by establishing a focus-driven tumor-specific module, namely CAP medicine in breast cancer (CAPmed-BC) (https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn). CAPmed-BC is the first multi-omics data resource in plasma medicine for analyzing the treatment response of breast cancer cells to CAP. It can analyze each type of omics data regarding differentially expressed biomarkers, expression landscape, gene ontology analysis, pathway interpretation, gene set enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network. It can also interrogate the dynamic fluctuation, functional activity, and metabolic vulnerability of cancer cells in response to CAP by combinatorially analyzing omics at multiple carefully defined dimensions.

38650009,Identification of osteoporosis ferroptosis-related markers and potential therapeutic compounds based on bioinformatics methods and molecular docking technology.,"<h4>Research background and purpose</h4>Osteoporosis (OP) is one of the most common bone diseases worldwide, characterized by low bone mineral density and susceptibility to pathological fractures, especially in postmenopausal women and elderly men. Ferroptosis is one of the newly discovered forms of cell death regulated by genes in recent years. Many studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely related to many diseases. However, there are few studies on ferroptosis in osteoporosis, and the mechanism of ferroptosis in osteoporosis is still unclear. This study aims to identify biomarkers related to osteoporosis ferroptosis from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database through bioinformatics technology, and to mine potential therapeutic small molecule compounds through molecular docking technology, trying to provide a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in the future.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We downloaded the ferroptosis-related gene set from the FerrDb database ( http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/index.html ), downloaded the data sets GSE56815 and GSE7429 from the GEO database, and used the R software ""limma"" package to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from GSE56815, and intersected with the ferroptosis gene set to obtain ferroptosis-related DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed by the R software ""clusterProfiler"" package. The random forest model was further screened to obtain essential ferroptosis genes. R software ""corrplot"" package was used for correlation analysis of essential ferroptosis genes, and the Wilcox test was used for significance analysis. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to construct a disease diagnosis model, and a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the diagnostic performance, and then GSE7429 was used to verify the reliability of the diagnosis model. Molecular docking technology was used to screen potential small molecule compounds from the Drugbank database. Finally, a rat osteoporosis model was constructed, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted for qRT-PCR detection to verify the mRNA expression levels of crucial ferroptosis genes.<h4>Result</h4>Six DEGs related to ferroptosis were initially screened out. GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that ferroptosis-related DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as maintenance of iron ion homeostasis, copper ion binding function, and ferroptosis. The random forest model identified five key ferroptosis genes, including CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1, and SLC2A3. Gene correlation analysis found a relatively low correlation between these five key ferroptosis genes. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network shows that BAZ1B and STAT3 may also be potential molecules. The ROC curve of the disease diagnosis model shows that the model has a good diagnostic performance. Molecular docking technology screened out three small molecule compounds, including NADH, Midostaurin, and Nintedanib small molecule compounds. qRT-PCR detection confirmed the differential expression of CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1 and SLC2A3 between OP and normal control group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified five key ferroptosis genes (CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1, and SLC2A3), they were most likely related to OP ferroptosis. In addition, we found that the small molecule compounds of NADH, Midostaurin, and Nintedanib had good docking scores with these five key ferroptosis genes.

38438345,A spatially-resolved transcriptional atlas of the murine dorsal pons at single-cell resolution.,"The ""dorsal pons"", or ""dorsal pontine tegmentum"" (dPnTg), is part of the brainstem. It is a complex, densely packed region whose nuclei are involved in regulating many vital functions. Notable among them are the parabrachial nucleus, the Kölliker Fuse, the Barrington nucleus, the locus coeruleus, and the dorsal, laterodorsal, and ventral tegmental nuclei. In this study, we applied single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to resolve neuronal subtypes based on their unique transcriptional profiles and then used multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to map them spatially. We sampled ~1 million cells across the dPnTg and defined the spatial distribution of over 120 neuronal subtypes. Our analysis identified an unpredicted high transcriptional diversity in this region and pinpointed the unique marker genes of many neuronal subtypes. We also demonstrated that many neuronal subtypes are transcriptionally similar between humans and mice, enhancing this study's translational value.

40536815,"Advances and challenges in cell-cell communication inference: a comprehensive review of tools, resources, and future directions.","Recent advancements in high-resolution and high-throughput sequencing technologies have significantly enhanced the study of cell-cell communication inference using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. Over the past 6 years, this growing interest has led to the development of more than 100 bioinformatics tools and nearly 50 resources, primarily in the form of ligand-receptor databases. These tools vary widely in their requirements, scoring approaches, ability to infer inter- and/or intra-cellular communication, assumptions, and limitations. Similarly, cell-cell communication resources differ in many aspects, mainly in the number of annotated interactions, species coverage, and their focus on inter-cellular signaling or both inter- and intra-cellular communication. This abundance and diversity create challenges in identifying compatible and suitable tools and resources to meet specific user needs. In this collaborative effort, we aim to provide a comprehensive report on the current state of cell-cell communication analysis derived from single-cell or spatial transcriptomics data. The report reviews existing methods and resources, addressing all relevant aspects from the user's perspective. It also explores current limitations, pitfalls, and unresolved issues in cell-cell communication inference, offering an aggregated analysis of the existing literature on the topic.

40996710,Biomedical literature-based clinical phenotype definition discovery using large language models.,"Electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping is a high-demand task because most phenotypes are not usually readily defined. The objective of this study is to develop an effective text-mining approach that automatically extracts clinical phenotype definitions-related sentences from biomedical literature. Abstract-level and full-text sentence-level classifiers were developed for clinical phenotype discovery from PubMed. We compared the performance of the abstract-level classifier on machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes, and decision tree. SVM classifier showed the best performance (F-measure = 98%) in identifying clinical phenotype-relevant abstracts. It predicted 459 406 clinical phenotype-related abstracts. For the full-text sentence-level classifier, we compared the performance of SVM, LR, naïve Bayes, decision trees, convolutional neural networks, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT). BioBERT model was the best performer among the full-text sentence-level classifiers (F-measure = 91%). We used these two optimal classifiers for large-scale screening of the PubMed database, starting with abstract retrieval and followed by predicting clinical phenotype-related sentences from full texts. The large-scale screening predicted over two million clinical phenotype-related sentences. Lastly, we developed a knowledgebase using positively predicted sentences, allowing users to query clinical phenotype-related sentences with a phenotype term of interest. The Clinical Phenotype Knowledgebase (CliPheKB) enables users to search for clinical phenotype terms and retrieve sentences related to a specific clinical phenotype of interest (https://cliphekb.shinyapps.io/phenotype-main/).

37098414,Review of databases for experimentally validated human microRNA-mRNA interactions.,"MicroRNAs (miRs) may contribute to disease etiology by influencing gene expression. Numerous databases are available for miR target prediction and validation, but their functionality is varied, and outputs are not standardized. The purpose of this review is to identify and describe databases for cataloging validated miR targets. Using Tools4miRs and PubMed, we identified databases with experimentally validated targets, human data, and a focus on miR-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions. Data were extracted about the number of times each database was cited, the number of miRs, the target genes, the interactions per database, experimental methodology and key features of each database. The search yielded 10 databases, which in order of most cited to least were: miRTarBase, starBase/The Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes, DIANA-TarBase, miRWalk, miRecords, miRGator, miRSystem, miRGate, miRSel and targetHub. Findings from this review suggest that the information presented within miR target validation databases can be enhanced by adding features such as flexibility in performing queries in multiple ways, downloadable data, ongoing updates and integrating tools for further miR-mRNA target interaction analysis.

However, there are still a large number of ncRNAs whose functions remain to be studied. Despite decades of research, the field continues to evolve, with each newly identified ncRNA undergoing processes such as biogenesis, identification, and functional annotation. Bioinformatics methodologies, alongside traditional biochemical experimental methods, have played an important role in advancing ncRNA research across various stages. Presently, over 50 types of ncRNAs have been characterized, each exhibiting diverse functions. However, there remains a need for standardization and integration of these ncRNAs within a unified framework. In response to this gap, this review traces the historical trajectory of ncRNA research and proposes a unified notation system. Additionally, we comprehensively elucidate the ncRNA interactome, detailing its associations with DNAs, RNAs, proteins, complexes, and chromatin.

The molecular and cellular mechanisms of sepsis are still unclear. We aim to identify key genes in sepsis and reveal potential disease mechanisms. Six sepsis-related blood transcriptome datasets were collected and analyzed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Functional annotation was performed in the gProfiler tool. DSigDB was used for drug signature enrichment analysis. The proportion of immune cells was estimated by the CIBERSORT tool. The relationships between modules, immune cells, and survival were identified by correlation analysis and survival analysis. A total of 37 stable co-expressed gene modules were identified. These modules were associated with the critical biology process in sepsis. Four modules can independently separate patients with long and short survival. Three modules can recurrently separate sepsis and normal patients with high accuracy. Some modules can separate bacterial pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, mixed bacterial and influenza A pneumonia, and non-infective systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

Accurate identification of antibiotic resistant strains is essential for the control of infection. In the present study, our goal is to leverage the whole-genome data of <i>H. pylori</i> to develop practical and interpretable machine learning (ML) models for comprehensive antibiotic resistance assessment. A total of 296 <i>H. pylori</i> isolates with genome-wide data were downloaded from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. By training ML models on feature sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms from SNP calling (SNPs-1), antibiotic-resistance SNP annotated by the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (SNPs-2), gene presence or absence (GPA), we generated predictive models for four antibiotics and multidrug-resistance (MDR). Among them, the models that combined SNPs-1, SNPs-2, and GPA data demonstrated the best performance, with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) consistently outperforming others. And then we utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the ML models. Furthermore, a free web application for the MDR model was deployed to the GitHub repository (https://H.pylori/MDR/App/).

38776381,Collecting and managing in situ banana genetic resources information (Musa spp.) using online resources and citizen science.,"The Musa Germplasm Information System (MGIS) stands as a pivotal database for managing global banana genetic resources information. In our latest effort, we have expanded MGIS to incorporate in situ observations. We thus incorporated more than 3000 in situ observations from 133 countries primarily sourced from iNaturalist, GBIF, Flickr, Pl@ntNet, Google Street view and expert curation of the literature. This addition provides a more comprehensive and detailed view of banana diversity and its distribution. Additional graphical interfaces, supported by new Drupal modules, were developed, allowing users to compare banana accessions and explore them based on various filters including taxonomy and geographic location. The integrated maps present a unified view, showcasing both in situ observations and the collecting locations of accessions held in germplasm collections. This enhancement not only broadens the scope of MGIS but also promotes a collaborative and open approach in documenting banana diversity, to allow more effective conservation and use of banana germplasm.

36155273,Knowledgebase of potential multifaceted solutions to antimicrobial resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a top threat to global health, challenges preventive and treatment strategies of infections. AMR strains of microbial pathogens arise through multiple mechanisms. The underlying ""antibiotic resistance genes"" (ARGs) spread through various species by lateral gene transfer thereby causing global dissemination. Human methods also augment this process through inappropriate use, non-compliance to treatment schedule, and environmental waste. Worldwide significant efforts are being invested to discover novel therapeutic solutions for tackling resistant pathogens. Diverse therapeutic strategies have evolved over recent years. In this work we have developed a comprehensive knowledgebase by collecting alternative antimicrobial therapeutic strategies from literature data. Therapeutic strategies against bacteria, virus, fungus and parasites were extracted from PubMed literature using text mining. We have used a subjective (sentimental) approach for data mining new strategies, resulting in broad coverage of novel entities and subsequently add objective data like entity name (including IUPAC), potency, and safety information. The extracted data was organized in a freely accessible web platform, KOMBAT. The KOMBAT comprises 1104 Chemical compounds, 220 of newly identified antimicrobial peptides, 42 bacteriophages, 242 phytochemicals, 106 nanocomposites, and 94 novel entities for phototherapy.

36550341,Towards Effective Consensus Scoring in Structure-Based Virtual Screening.,"Virtual screening (VS) is a computational strategy that uses in silico automated protein docking inter alia to rank potential ligands, or by extension rank protein-ligand pairs, identifying potential drug candidates. Most docking methods use preferred sets of physicochemical descriptors (PCDs) to model the interactions between host and guest molecules. Thus, conventional VS is often data-specific, method-dependent and with demonstrably differing utility in identifying candidate drugs. This study proposes four universality classes of novel consensus scoring (CS) algorithms that combine docking scores, derived from ten docking programs (ADFR, DOCK, Gemdock, Ledock, PLANTS, PSOVina, QuickVina2, Smina, Autodock Vina and VinaXB), using decoys from the DUD-E repository ( http://dude.docking.org/ ) against 29 MRSA-oriented targets to create a general VS formulation that can identify active ligands for any suitable protein target. Our results demonstrate that CS provides improved ligand-protein docking fidelity when compared to individual docking platforms. This approach requires only a small number of docking combinations and can serve as a viable and parsimonious alternative to more computationally expensive docking approaches. Predictions from our CS algorithm are compared against independent machine learning evaluations using the same docking data, complementing the CS outcomes.

37386017,Combination of expert guidelines-based and machine learning-based approaches leads to superior accuracy of automated prediction of clinical effect of copy number variations.,"Clinical interpretation of copy number variants (CNVs) is a complex process that requires skilled clinical professionals. General recommendations have been recently released to guide the CNV interpretation based on predefined criteria to uniform the decision process. Several semiautomatic computational methods have been proposed to recommend appropriate choices, relieving clinicians of tedious searching in vast genomic databases. We have developed and evaluated such a tool called MarCNV and tested it on CNV records collected from the ClinVar database. Alternatively, the emerging machine learning-based tools, such as the recently published ISV (Interpretation of Structural Variants), showed promising ways of even fully automated predictions using broader characterization of affected genomic elements. Such tools utilize features additional to ACMG criteria, thus providing supporting evidence and the potential to improve CNV classification. Since both approaches contribute to evaluation of CNVs clinical impact, we propose a combined solution in the form of a decision support tool based on automated ACMG guidelines (MarCNV) supplemented by a machine learning-based pathogenicity prediction (ISV) for the classification of CNVs. We provide evidence that such a combined approach is able to reduce the number of uncertain classifications and reveal potentially incorrect classifications using automated guidelines.

As <i>Leishmania</i> lack a functional non-homologous DNA end joining pathway however, obtaining null mutants typically requires additional donor DNA, selection of drug resistance-associated edits or time-consuming isolation of clones. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens across different conditions and across multiple <i>Leishmania</i> species are therefore unfeasible at present. Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 cytosine base editor (CBE) toolbox that overcomes these limitations. We employed CBEs in <i>Leishmania</i> to introduce STOP codons by converting cytosine into thymine and created http://www.leishbaseedit.net/ for CBE primer design in kinetoplastids. Through reporter assays and by targeting single- and multi-copy genes in <i>L. mexicana</i>, <i>L. major</i>, <i>L. donovani</i>, and <i>L. infantum</i>, we demonstrate how this tool can efficiently generate functional null mutants by expressing just one single-guide RNA, reaching up to 100% editing rate in non-clonal populations. We then generated a <i>Leishmania</i>-optimised CBE and successfully targeted an essential gene in a plasmid library delivered loss-of-function screen in <i>L. mexicana</i>.
