We addressed varying label noise and feature space quality, utilizing artificial intelligence and advanced computing. Our method relies solely on openly available data streams and methods, eliminating training data acquisition or the need for additional expert knowledge for such purpose. We extracted land use labels from OpenStreetMap and remote sensing data to create a contiguous land use map of the European Union as of March 2020. OpenStreetMap tags were translated into land use labels, directly mapping 61.8% of the Union's area. These labels served as training data for a classification model, predicting land use in remaining areas. Country-specific deep learning convolutional neural networks and Sentinel-2 feature space composites of 2020 at 10 m resolution were employed. The overall map accuracy is 89%, with class-specific accuracies ranging from 77% to 99%.

A limited number of reference sequences are available; a substantial fraction of phylogenetic diversity is not fully characterized; widely used databases do not reflect current archaeal taxonomy and contain mislabelled sequences. We address these gaps with a systematic and tractable approach based around the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) combined with the eukaryote PR2 and MIDORI mitochondrial databases. After removing incongruent, chimeric and duplicate SSU sequences, this combination (<i>GTDB+</i>) provides a small improvement in annotation of a set of estuarine Archaea Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) compared to SILVA. We add to this a collection of near full length rRNA sequences and the prokaryote SSU sequences in SILVA, creating a new reference database, KSGP ( <b><i>K</i></b> arst, <b><i>S</i></b> ilva, <b><i>G</i></b> TDB, and <b>P</b>R2). The additional sequences are (re-)annotated using three different approaches. The most conservative, using lowest common ancestor, gives a further small improvement. Annotation using SINTAX increases Class and Order assignments by 2.7 and 4.2 times over SILVA, although this may include some ""lumping"" of un-named and named clades. Still further improvement can be made using similarity based clustering to group database sequences into putative taxa at all taxonomic levels, assigning 60% and 41% of Archaea OTUs to putative family and genus level taxa respectively.

A low percentage of <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> species complex (RSSC) strains possess the CRISPR array and the CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) that would confer immunity against various phages. To provide a wide-range screen of the CRISPR presence in the RSSC, we analyzed 378 genomes of RSSC strains to find the CRISPR locus. We found that 20.1, 14.3, and 54.5% of the <i>R. solanacearum</i>, <i>R. pseudosolanacearum</i>, and <i>R. syzygii</i> strains, respectively, possess the CRISPR locus. In addition, we performed further analysis to identify the respective phages that are restricted by the CRISPR arrays. We found 252 different phages infecting different strains of the RSSC, by means of the identification of similarities between the protospacers in phages and spacers in bacteria.

One of the goals of the Consortium is to facilitate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management and the integration of datasets which requires data sharing, along with structured vocabularies and/or ontologies. Two AgBioData working groups, focused on Data Sharing and Ontologies, respectively, conducted a Consortium-wide survey to assess the current status and future needs of the members in those areas. A total of 33 researchers responded to the survey, representing 37 databases. Results suggest that data-sharing practices by AgBioData databases are in a fairly healthy state, but it is not clear whether this is true for all metadata and data types across all databases; and that, ontology use has not substantially changed since a similar survey was conducted in 2017. Based on our evaluation of the survey results, we recommend (i) providing training for database personnel in a specific data-sharing techniques, as well as in ontology use; (ii) further study on what metadata is shared, and how well it is shared among databases; (iii) promoting an understanding of data sharing and ontologies in the stakeholder community; (iv) improving data sharing and ontologies for specific phenotypic data types and formats; and (v) lowering specific barriers to data sharing and ontology use, by identifying sustainability solutions, and the identification, promotion, or development of data standards.

The main challenge lies in accurately mapping these mutations to protein structures and analysing their effects on protein function. To address this, Mut-Map (https://genemutation.org/) is a comprehensive computational pipeline designed to integrate mutation data from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer database with protein structural data from the Protein Data Bank and AlphaFold models. The pipeline begins by taking a UniProt ID and proceeds through mapping corresponding Protein Data Bank structures, renumbering residues, and assessing disorder percentages. It then overlays mutation data, categorizes mutations based on structural context, and visualizes them using advanced tools like MolStar. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of how mutations may disrupt protein function by affecting key regions such as DNA interfaces, ligand-binding sites, and dimer interactions. To validate the pipeline, a case study on the TP53 gene, a critical tumour suppressor often mutated in cancers, was conducted. The analysis highlighted the most frequent mutations occurring at the DNA-binding interface, providing insights into their potential role in cancer progression.

However, no platform is available to provide a comprehensive and systematic multi-omics analysis for millets, which seriously hinders the mining of stress-related genes and the molecular breeding of millets. Here, a free, web-accessible, user-friendly millets multi-omics database platform (Milletdb, http://milletdb.novogene.com) has been developed. The Milletdb contains six millets and their one related species genomes, graph-based pan-genomics of pearl millet, and stress-related multi-omics data, which enable Milletdb to be the most complete millets multi-omics database available. We stored GWAS (genome-wide association study) results of 20 yield-related trait data obtained under three environmental conditions [field (no stress), early drought and late drought] for 2 years in the database, allowing users to identify stress-related genes that support yield improvement. Milletdb can simplify the functional genomics analysis of millets by providing users with 20 different tools (e.g., 'Gene mapping', 'Co-expression', 'KEGG/GO Enrichment' analysis, etc.).

39530237,PolyASite v3.0: a multi-species atlas of polyadenylation sites inferred from single-cell RNA-sequencing data.,"The broadly used 10X Genomics technology for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures RNA 3' ends. Thus, some reads contain part of the non-templated polyadenosine tails, providing direct evidence for the sites of 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation on the respective RNAs. Taking advantage of this property, we recently developed the SCINPAS workflow to infer polyadenylation sites (PASs) from scRNA-seq data. Here, we used this workflow to construct version 3.0 (v3.0, https://polyasite.unibas.ch/) of the PolyASite Atlas from a big compendium of publicly available human, mouse and worm scRNA-seq datasets obtained from healthy tissues. As the resolution of scRNA-seq was too low for robust detection of cell-level differences in PAS usage, we aggregated samples based on their tissue-of-origin to construct tissue-level catalogs of PASs. These provide qualitatively new information about PAS usage, in comparison to the previous PAS catalogs that were based on bulk 3' end sequencing experiments primarily in cell lines. In the new version, we document stringency levels associated with each PAS so that users can balance sensitivity and specificity in their analysis. We also upgraded the integration with the UCSC Genome Browser and developed track hubs conveniently displaying pooled and tissue-specific expression of PASs.",False,True,,0.7026774,polyasite,,16.0,ok,,ucsc genome browser,scinpas,spacy,0.0,PolyASite,False,0,True,False,https://polyasite.unibas.ch/,https://polyasite.unibas.ch/,True,"...sed this workflow to construct version 3.0 (v3.0, https://polyasite.unibas.ch/) of the PolyASite Atlas from a big compendium of...",1
38630617,RNAscape: geometric mapping and customizable visualization of RNA structure.,"Analyzing and visualizing the tertiary structure and complex interactions of RNA is essential for being able to mechanistically decipher their molecular functions in vivo. Secondary structure visualization software can portray many aspects of RNA; however, these layouts are often unable to preserve topological correspondence since they do not consider tertiary interactions between different regions of an RNA molecule. Likewise, quaternary interactions between two or more interacting RNA molecules are not considered in secondary structure visualization tools. The RNAscape webserver produces visualizations that can preserve topological correspondence while remaining both visually intuitive and structurally insightful. RNAscape achieves this by designing a mathematical structural mapping algorithm which prioritizes the helical segments, reflecting their tertiary organization. Non-helical segments are mapped in a way that minimizes structural clutter. RNAscape runs a plotting script that is designed to generate publication-quality images. RNAscape natively supports non-standard nucleotides, multiple base-pairing annotation styles and requires no programming experience. RNAscape can also be used to analyze RNA/DNA hybrid structures and DNA topologies, including G-quadruplexes. Users can upload their own three-dimensional structures or enter a Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID of an existing structure.

However, many of the available information about human allele frequencies, and about clinical drug-gene interactions, is based on American and European populations. PharmaKoVariome database was constructed to support genetic testing for safe prescription and drug development. It consolidated and stored 2507 diseases, 11 459 drugs and 61 627 drug-target or druggable genes from public databases. PharmaKoVariome precomputed ethnic-specific abundant variants for approximately 120 M single-nucleotide variants of drug-target or druggable genes. A user can search by gene symbol, drug name, disease and reference SNP ID number (rsID) to statistically analyse the frequency of ethnical variations, such as odds ratio and P-values for related genes. In an example study, we observed five Korean-enriched variants in the CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 genes, one of which (rs1065852) is known to be incapable of metabolizing drug. It is also shown that 4-6% of North and East Asians have risk factors for drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 gene. Therefore, PharmaKoVariome is a useful database for pharmaceutical or diagnostic companies for developing diagnostic technologies that can be applied in the Asian PGx industry.

35190711,The ConTraSt database for analysing and comparing empirical studies of consciousness theories.,"Understanding how consciousness arises from neural activity remains one of the biggest challenges for neuroscience. Numerous theories have been proposed in recent years, each gaining independent empirical support. Currently, there is no comprehensive, quantitative and theory-neutral overview of the field that enables an evaluation of how theoretical frameworks interact with empirical research. We provide a bird's eye view of studies that interpreted their findings in light of at least one of four leading neuroscientific theories of consciousness (N = 412 experiments), asking how methodological choices of the researchers might affect the final conclusions. We found that supporting a specific theory can be predicted solely from methodological choices, irrespective of findings. Furthermore, most studies interpret their findings post hoc, rather than a priori testing critical predictions of the theories.

To reveal functional features of the Hyp proteome, we integrated various data sources for deep proteome profiling of the Hyp proteome in humans and developed HypDB (https://www.HypDB.site), an annotated database and web server for Hyp proteome. HypDB provides site-specific evidence of modification based on extensive LC-MS analysis and literature mining with 14,413 nonredundant Hyp sites on 5,165 human proteins including 3,383 Class I and 4,335 Class II sites. Annotation analysis revealed significant enrichment of Hyp on key functional domains and tissue-specific distribution of Hyp abundance across 26 types of human organs and fluids and 6 cell lines. The network connectivity analysis further revealed a critical role of Hyp in mediating protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the spectral library generated by HypDB enabled data-independent analysis (DIA) of clinical tissues and the identification of novel Hyp biomarkers in lung cancer and kidney cancer.

36289281,Mapping human disease-associated enzymes into Reactome allows characterization of disease groups and their interactions.,"According to databases such as OMIM, Humsavar, Clinvar and Monarch, 1494 human enzymes are presently associated to 2539 genetic diseases, 75% of which are rare (with an Orphanet code). The Mondo ontology initiative allows a standardization of the disease name into specific codes, making it possible a computational association between genes, variants, diseases, and their effects on biological processes. Here, we tackle the problem of which biological processes enzymes can affect when the protein variant is disease-associated. We adopt Reactome to describe human biological processes, and by mapping disease-associated enzymes in the Reactome pathways, we establish a Reactome-disease association. This allows a novel categorization of human monogenic and polygenic diseases based on Reactome pathways and reactions. Our analysis aims at dissecting the complexity of the human genetic disease universe, highlighting all the possible links within diseases and Reactome pathways. The novel mapping helps understanding the biochemical/molecular biology of the disease and allows a direct glimpse on the present knowledge of other molecules involved. This is useful for a complete overview of the disease molecular mechanism/s and for planning future investigations.

In the remodeling of ECM, a remarkable variation in collagen post-translational modifications (PTMs) occurs. This makes collagen a potential target for understanding extracellular matrix remodeling during pathological conditions. Over the years, scientists have gathered a huge amount of data about collagen PTM during extracellular matrix remodeling. To make such information easily accessible in a consolidated space, we have developed ColPTMScape (https://colptmscape.iitmandi.ac.in/), a dedicated knowledge base for collagen PTMs. The identified site-specific PTMs, quantitated PTM sites, and PTM maps of collagen chains are deliverables to the scientific community, especially to matrix biologists.

39198545,Emotional palette: a computational mapping of aesthetic experiences evoked by visual art.,"Despite the evolutionary history and cultural significance of visual art, the structure of aesthetic experiences it evokes has only attracted recent scientific attention. What kinds of experience does visual art evoke? Guided by Semantic Space Theory, we identify the concepts that most precisely describe people's aesthetic experiences using new computational techniques. Participants viewed 1457 artworks sampled from diverse cultural and historical traditions and reported on the emotions they felt and their perceived artwork qualities. Results show that aesthetic experiences are high-dimensional, comprising 25 categories of feeling states. Extending well beyond hedonism and broad evaluative judgments (e.g., pleasant/unpleasant), aesthetic experiences involve emotions of daily social living (e.g., ""sad"", ""joy""), the imagination (e.g., ""psychedelic"", ""mysterious""), profundity (e.g., ""disgust"", ""awe""), and perceptual qualities attributed to the artwork (e.g., ""whimsical"", ""disorienting""). Aesthetic emotions and perceptual qualities jointly predict viewers' liking of the artworks, indicating that we conceptualize aesthetic experiences in terms of the emotions we feel but also the qualities we perceive in the artwork. Aesthetic experiences are often mixed and lie along continuous gradients between categories rather than within discrete clusters.

38438345,A spatially-resolved transcriptional atlas of the murine dorsal pons at single-cell resolution.,"The ""dorsal pons"", or ""dorsal pontine tegmentum"" (dPnTg), is part of the brainstem. It is a complex, densely packed region whose nuclei are involved in regulating many vital functions. Notable among them are the parabrachial nucleus, the Kölliker Fuse, the Barrington nucleus, the locus coeruleus, and the dorsal, laterodorsal, and ventral tegmental nuclei. In this study, we applied single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to resolve neuronal subtypes based on their unique transcriptional profiles and then used multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) to map them spatially. We sampled ~1 million cells across the dPnTg and defined the spatial distribution of over 120 neuronal subtypes. Our analysis identified an unpredicted high transcriptional diversity in this region and pinpointed the unique marker genes of many neuronal subtypes. We also demonstrated that many neuronal subtypes are transcriptionally similar between humans and mice, enhancing this study's translational value.

37098414,Review of databases for experimentally validated human microRNA-mRNA interactions.,"MicroRNAs (miRs) may contribute to disease etiology by influencing gene expression. Numerous databases are available for miR target prediction and validation, but their functionality is varied, and outputs are not standardized. The purpose of this review is to identify and describe databases for cataloging validated miR targets. Using Tools4miRs and PubMed, we identified databases with experimentally validated targets, human data, and a focus on miR-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions. Data were extracted about the number of times each database was cited, the number of miRs, the target genes, the interactions per database, experimental methodology and key features of each database. The search yielded 10 databases, which in order of most cited to least were: miRTarBase, starBase/The Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes, DIANA-TarBase, miRWalk, miRecords, miRGator, miRSystem, miRGate, miRSel and targetHub. Findings from this review suggest that the information presented within miR target validation databases can be enhanced by adding features such as flexibility in performing queries in multiple ways, downloadable data, ongoing updates and integrating tools for further miR-mRNA target interaction analysis.
