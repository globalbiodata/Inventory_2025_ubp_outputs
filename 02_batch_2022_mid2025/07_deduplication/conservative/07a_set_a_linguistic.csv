"35380657, 36930729, 37347557",MOET: a web-based gene set enrichment tool at the Rat Genome Database for multiontology and multispecies analyses.,"Biological interpretation of a large amount of gene or protein data is complex. Ontology analysis tools are imperative in finding functional similarities through overrepresentation or enrichment of terms associated with the input gene or protein lists. However, most tools are limited by their ability to do ontology-specific and species-limited analyses. Furthermore, some enrichment tools are not updated frequently with recent information from databases, thus giving users inaccurate, outdated or uninformative data. Here, we present MOET or the Multi-Ontology Enrichment Tool (v.1 released in April 2019 and v.2 released in May 2021), an ontology analysis tool leveraging data that the Rat Genome Database (RGD) integrated from in-house expert curation and external databases including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), The Gene Ontology Resource, UniProt-GOA, and others. Given a gene or protein list, MOET analysis identifies significantly overrepresented ontology terms using a hypergeometric test and provides nominal and Bonferroni corrected P-values and odds ratios for the overrepresented terms. The results are shown as a downloadable list of terms with and without Bonferroni correction, and a graph of the P-values and number of annotated genes for each term in the list.

"35898309, 37676599",CARs-DB: A Database of Cryptic Amyloidogenic Regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.,"Proteome-wide analyses suggest that most globular proteins contain at least one amyloidogenic region, whereas these aggregation-prone segments are thought to be underrepresented in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). In recent work, we reported that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) indeed sustain a significant amyloid load in the form of cryptic amyloidogenic regions (CARs). CARs are widespread in IDRs, but they are necessarily exposed to solvent, and thus they should be more polar and have a milder aggregation potential than conventional amyloid regions protected inside globular proteins. CARs are connected with IDPs function and, in particular, with the establishment of protein-protein interactions through their IDRs. However, their presence also appears associated with pathologies like cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Given the relevance of CARs for both IDPs function and malfunction, we developed CARs-DB, a database containing precomputed predictions for all CARs present in the IDPs deposited in the DisProt database. This web tool allows for the fast and comprehensive exploration of previously unnoticed amyloidogenic regions embedded within IDRs sequences and might turn helpful in identifying disordered interacting regions. It contains >8,900 unique CARs identified in a total of 1711 IDRs. CARs-DB is freely available for users and can be accessed at http://carsdb.ppmclab.com.

AlphaKnot has two main functions: (i) providing researchers with a webserver for analyzing knotting in their own AlphaFold predictions and (ii) providing a database of knotting in AlphaFold predictions from the 21 proteomes for which models have been published prior to 2022. The knotting is defined in a probabilistic fashion. The knotting complexity of proteins is presented in the form of a matrix diagram which shows users the knot type for the entire polypeptide chain and for each of its subchains. The dominant knot types as well as the computed locations of the knot cores (i.e. minimal portions of protein backbones that form a given knot type) are shown for each protein structure. Based mainly on the pLDDT confidence values, entanglements are classified as Knots, Unsure, and Artifacts. The database portion of the server can be used, for example, to examine protein geometry and entanglement-function correlations, as a reference set for protein modeling, and for facilitating evolutional studies.

"36243961, 39271119",DrugMAP: molecular atlas and pharma-information of all drugs.,"The efficacy and safety of drugs are widely known to be determined by their interactions with multiple molecules of pharmacological importance, and it is therefore essential to systematically depict the molecular atlas and pharma-information of studied drugs. However, our understanding of such information is neither comprehensive nor precise, which necessitates the construction of a new database providing a network containing a large number of drugs and their interacting molecules. Here, a new database describing the molecular atlas and pharma-information of drugs (DrugMAP) was therefore constructed. It provides a comprehensive list of interacting molecules for >30 000 drugs/drug candidates, gives the differential expression patterns for >5000 interacting molecules among different disease sites, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-relevant organs and physiological tissues, and weaves a comprehensive and precise network containing >200 000 interactions among drugs and molecules. With the great efforts made to clarify the complex mechanism underlying drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and rapidly emerging interests in artificial intelligence (AI)-based network analyses, DrugMAP is expected to become an indispensable supplement to existing databases to facilitate drug discovery.

Originally, it only contained data on the chemical structures of modified ribonucleosides, their biosynthetic pathways, the location of modified residues in RNA sequences, and RNA-modifying enzymes. Over the years, prompted by the accumulation of new knowledge and new types of data, it has been updated with new information and functionalities. In this new release, we have created a catalog of RNA modifications linked to human diseases, e.g., due to mutations in genes encoding modification enzymes. MODOMICS has been linked extensively to RCSB Protein Data Bank, and sequences of experimentally determined RNA structures with modified residues have been added. This expansion was accompanied by including nucleotide 5'-monophosphate residues. We redesigned the web interface and upgraded the database backend. In addition, a search engine for chemically similar modified residues has been included that can be queried by SMILES codes or by drawing chemical molecules. Finally, previously available datasets of modified residues, biosynthetic pathways, and RNA-modifying enzymes have been updated.

37789571,Analyzing the cation-aromatic interactions in proteins: Cation-aromatic database V2.0.,"The cation-aromatic database (CAD) is a comprehensive repository of cation-aromatic motifs found in experimentally determined protein structures, first reported in 2007 [Proteins, 2007, 67, 1179]. The present article is an update of CAD that contains information of approximately 27.26 million cation-aromatic motifs. CAD uses three distance parameters (r, d1, and d2) to determine the position of the cation relative to the centroid of the aromatic residue and classifies the motifs as cation-π or cation-σ interactions. As of June 2023, about 193 936 protein structures were retrieved from Protein Data Bank, and this resulted in the identification of an impressive number of 27 255 817 cation-aromatic motifs. Among these motifs, spherical motifs constituted 94.09%, while cylindrical motifs made up the remaining 5.91%. When considering the interaction of metal ions with aromatic residues, 965 564 motifs are identified. Remarkably, 82.08% of these motifs involved the binding of metal ions to the amino acid HIS. Moreover, the analysis of binding preferences between cations and aromatic residues revealed that the HIS-HIS, PHE-ARG, and TRP-ARG pairs exhibited a preferential geometry. The motif pair HIS-HIS was the most prevalent, accounting for 19.87% of the total, closely followed by TYR-LYS at 10.17%. Conversely, the motif pair TRP-HIS had the lowest occurrence, representing only 4.20% of the total.

36040109,G-DIRT: a web server for identification and removal of duplicate germplasms based on identity-by-state analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping data.,"Maintaining duplicate germplasms in genebanks hampers effective conservation and utilization of genebank resources. The redundant germplasm adds to the cost of germplasm conservation by requiring a large proportion of the genebank financial resources towards conservation rather than enriching the diversity. Besides, genome-wide-association analysis using an association panel with over-represented germplasms can be biased resulting in spurious marker-trait associations. The conventional methods of germplasm duplicate removal using passport information suffer from incomplete or missing passport information and data handling errors at various stages of germplasm enrichment. This limitation is less likely in the case of genotypic data. Therefore, we developed a web-based tool, Germplasm Duplicate Identification and Removal Tool (G-DIRT), which allows germplasm duplicate identification based on identity-by-state analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping information along with pre-processing of genotypic data. A homozygous genotypic difference threshold of 0.1% for germplasm duplicates has been determined using tetraploid wheat genotypic data with 94.97% of accuracy. Based on the genotypic difference, the tool also builds a dendrogram that can visually depict the relationship between genotypes. To overcome the constraint of high-dimensional genotypic data, an offline version of G-DIRT in the interface of R has also been developed. The G-DIRT is expected to help genebank curators, breeders and other researchers across the world in identifying germplasm duplicates from the global genebank collections by only using the easily sharable genotypic data instead of physically exchanging the seeds or propagating materials.

Previous studies have demonstrated that eccDNAs are essential to cancer progression, and found that they can not only express in normal cells to regulate RNA, but also function differently in different tissues. It is of major interest to conduct computational or experiments assay to elucidate the mechanisms of eccDNA function, uncover key eccDNAs associated with diseases, and even develop related algorithms for liquid biopsy. Naturally, a comprehensive eccDNAs data resource is urgently needed to provide annotation and analysis more in-depth research. In this study, we constructed the eccBase (http://www.eccbase.net) in literature curation and database retrieval, which was the first database mainly collecting eccDNAs from Homo sapiens (n = 754,391) and Mus musculus (n = 481,381). Homo sapiens eccDNAs were taken from 50 kinds of cancer tissue and/or cell line, and 5 kinds of healthy tissues. The Mus musculus eccDNAs were sourced from 13 kinds of healthy tissue and/or cell line. We thoroughly annotated all eccDNA molecules in terms of basic information, genomic composition, regulatory elements, epigenetic modifications, and raw data. EccBase provided users with the ability to browse, search, download for targets of interest, as well as similarity alignment by the integrated BLAST. Further, comparative analysis suggested the cancer eccDNA is composed of nucleosomes and is prominently derived from the gene-dense regions.

35348648,Diseases 2.0: a weekly updated database of disease-gene associations from text mining and data integration.,"The scientific knowledge about which genes are involved in which diseases grows rapidly, which makes it difficult to keep up with new publications and genetics datasets. The DISEASES database aims to provide a comprehensive overview by systematically integrating and assigning confidence scores to evidence for disease-gene associations from curated databases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and automatic text mining of the biomedical literature. Here, we present a major update to this resource, which greatly increases the number of associations from all these sources. This is especially true for the text-mined associations, which have increased by at least 9-fold at all confidence cutoffs. We show that this dramatic increase is primarily due to adding full-text articles to the text corpus, secondarily due to improvements to both the disease and gene dictionaries used for named entity recognition, and only to a very small extent due to the growth in number of PubMed abstracts. DISEASES now also makes use of a new GWAS database, Target Illumination by GWAS Analytics, which considerably increased the number of GWAS-derived disease-gene associations.

Growing research has highlighted the critical importance of identifying and understanding the roles of chemicals in reproductive biology. However, the functions and mechanisms of chemicals in reproductive processes remain incomplete. We developed a comprehensive database called the Reproductive Chemical Database (RCDB) ( https://yu.life.sjtu.edu.cn/ChenLab/RCDB ) to facilitate research on chemicals in reproductive biology. This resource is founded on rigorous manual literature extraction and precise protein target prediction methodologies. This database focuses on the delineation of chemicals associated with phenotypes, diseases, or endpoints intricately associated with four important reproductive processes: female and male gamete generation, fertilization, and embryo development in human and mouse.

40996709,Gene Loss DB: a curated database for gene loss in mammals-the cetacean collection.,"Molecular databases are essential resources for both experimental and computational biologists. The rapid increase in high-quality genome assemblies has led to a surge in publications describing secondary gene loss events associated with lineage-specific adaptations across diverse vertebrate groups. This growing volume of information underscores the urgent need for organized, searchable, and curated resources that facilitate data discovery, allow detection of broad evolutionary patterns, and support downstream analyses. Currently, no existing database compiles manually curated and validated information on published secondary gene loss events. Here, we introduce the Gene Loss Database (Gene Loss DB), a platform designed to centralize and present these data in an easy-to-search and user-friendly format (https://geneloss.org/). Gene Loss DB compiles gene loss events alongside supporting evidence, including the inferred mechanism of gene loss (exon deletion, gene deletion, loss of function mutation), the type of data used to support inactivation (genomic, transcriptomic, single/multiple individual sequence reads, synteny maps) and, when available, whether the event is shared across all lineages within a taxon. Each entry also includes a short excerpt from the original publication to provide context. This information is structured in the database to be searchable by species, gene, taxa, or by gene ontology terms linked to the gene in question. The initial release of Gene Loss DB focuses on cetaceans, a lineage with numerous gene loss events linked to aquatic adaptations.

39910485,"sORFdb - a database for sORFs, small proteins, and small protein families in bacteria.","Small proteins with fewer than 100, particularly fewer than 50, amino acids are still largely unexplored. Nonetheless, they represent an essential part of bacteria's often neglected genetic repertoire. In recent years, the development of ribosome profiling protocols has led to the detection of an increasing number of previously unknown small proteins. Despite this, they are overlooked in many cases by automated genome annotation pipelines, and often, no functional descriptions can be assigned due to a lack of known homologs. To understand and overcome these limitations, the current abundance of small proteins in existing databases was evaluated, and a new dedicated database for small proteins and their potential functions, called 'sORFdb', was created. To this end, small proteins were extracted from annotated bacterial genomes in the GenBank database. Subsequently, they were quality-filtered, compared, and complemented with proteins from Swiss-Prot, UniProt, and SmProt to ensure reliable identification and characterization of small proteins. Families of similar small proteins were created using bidirectional best BLAST hits followed by Markov clustering. Analysis of small proteins in public databases revealed that their number is still limited due to historical and technical constraints. Additionally, functional descriptions were often missing despite the presence of potential homologs. As expected, a taxonomic bias was evident in over-represented clinically relevant bacteria. This new and comprehensive database is accessible via a feature-rich website providing specialized search features for sORFs and small proteins of high quality. Additionally, small protein families with Hidden Markov Models and information on taxonomic distribution and other physicochemical properties are available. In conclusion, the novel small protein database sORFdb is a specialized, taxonomy-independent database that improves the findability and classification of sORFs, small proteins, and their functions in bacteria, thereby supporting their future detection and consistent annotation.

38628370,KANPHOS: Kinase-associated neural phospho-signaling database for data-driven research.,"Protein phosphorylation, a key regulator of cellular processes, plays a central role in brain function and is implicated in neurological disorders. Information on protein phosphorylation is expected to be a clue for understanding various neuropsychiatric disorders and developing therapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, existing databases lack a specific focus on phosphorylation events in the brain, which are crucial for investigating the downstream pathway regulated by neurotransmitters. To overcome the gap, we have developed a web-based database named ""Kinase-Associated Neural PHOspho-Signaling (KANPHOS)."" This paper presents the design concept, detailed features, and a series of improvements for KANPHOS. KANPHOS is designed to support data-driven research by fulfilling three key objectives: (1) enabling the search for protein kinases and their substrates related to extracellular signals or diseases; (2) facilitating a consolidated search for information encompassing phosphorylated substrate genes, proteins, mutant mice, diseases, and more; and (3) offering integrated functionalities to support pathway and network analysis. KANPHOS is also equipped with API functionality to interact with external databases and analysis tools, enhancing its utility in data-driven investigations.

37183478,y-mtPTM: Yeast mitochondrial posttranslational modification database.,"One powerful strategy of how to increase the complexity of cellular proteomes is through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. Currently, there are ∼400 types of PTMs, the different combinations of which yield a large variety of protein isoforms with distinct biochemical properties. Although mitochondrial proteins undergoing PTMs were identified nearly 6 decades ago, studies on the roles and extent of PTMs on mitochondrial functions lagged behind the other cellular compartments. The application of mass spectrometry for the characterization of the mitochondrial proteome as well as for the detection of various PTMs resulted in the identification of thousands of amino acid positions that can be modified by different chemical groups. However, the data on mitochondrial PTMs are scattered in several data sets, and the available databases do not contain a complete list of modified residues. To integrate information on PTMs of the mitochondrial proteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we built the yeast mitochondrial posttranslational modification (y-mtPTM) database (http://compbio.fmph.uniba.sk/y-mtptm/). It lists nearly 20,000 positions on mitochondrial proteins affected by ∼20 various PTMs, with phosphorylated, succinylated, acetylated, and ubiquitylated sites being the most abundant. A simple search of a protein of interest reveals the modified amino acid residues, their position within the primary sequence as well as on its 3D structure, and links to the source reference(s).

Fungal glycoside hydrolase family 32 (GH32) enzymes, especially inulinases, are central to this process, yet no dedicated database existed. To fill this gap, we developed FUNIN, a cloud-based, non-relational database cataloging and analyzing fungal GH32 enzymes relevant to inulin hydrolysis. Built with MongoDB and hosted on AWS, FUNIN integrates enzyme sequences, taxonomic data, physicochemical properties, and annotations from UniProt and InterPro via an automated ELT pipeline. Tools like CLEAN and ProtParam were used for EC number prediction and sequence characterization. The database currently includes 3420 GH32 enzymes, with strong representation from Ascomycota (91.2 %) and key genera such as Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium. Exo-inulinases (43.9 %), endo-inulinases (33.4 %), and invertases (21.6 %) dominate the dataset. These enzymes share conserved domains (PF00251-PF08244), acidic pI values, and moderate hydrophobicity. A network similarity analysis revealed structural conservation among exo-inulinases.

36698975,"CUCUME: An RNA methylation database integrating systemic mRNAs signals, GWAS and QTL genetic regulation and epigenetics in different tissues of <i>Cucurbitaceae</i>.","As an internal modification of transcripts, RNA methylation determines RNA fate by changing RNA-protein binding affinity. In plants, RNA methylation is ubiquitous and is involved in all aspects of RNA post-transcriptional regulation. For instance, long-distance mobile RNAs, strongly influenced by their methylation status, play important roles in plant growth, development and environmental adaptation. Cucumber/pumpkin heterografts are widely used to improve stress tolerance of cucumber and to study mobile RNA signals due to their strong developed vasculature system. Here, we developed the Cucume (Cucurbit RNA methylation, http://cucume.cn/) database for these two important vegetables, cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i> L.) and pumpkin (<i>Cucurbita moschata</i>) with high productivity worldwide. We identified mRNAs harboring 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) and N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) sites in pumpkin and cucumber at the whole genome level via Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) of different tissues and the vascular exudates. In addition to RNA methylation sites, the Cucume database includes graft-transmissible systemic mRNAs identified in previous studies using cucumber/pumpkin heterografts. The further integration of cucumber genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) allows the study of RNA methylation-related genetic and epigenetic regulation in cucurbits.

This paper introduces the Global Jukebox as a resource for comparative and cross-cultural study of the performing arts and culture. The Global Jukebox adds an extensive and detailed global database of the performing arts that enlarges our understanding of human cultural diversity. Initially prototyped by Alan Lomax in the 1980s, its core is the Cantometrics dataset, encompassing standardized codings on 37 aspects of musical style for 5,776 traditional songs from 1,026 societies. The Cantometrics dataset has been cleaned and checked for reliability and accuracy, and includes a full coding guide with audio training examples (https://theglobaljukebox.org/?songsofearth). Also being released are seven additional datasets coding and describing instrumentation, conversation, popular music, vowel and consonant placement, breath management, social factors, and societies. For the first time, all digitized Global Jukebox data are being made available in open-access, downloadable format (https://github.com/theglobaljukebox), linked with streaming audio recordings (theglobaljukebox.org) to the maximum extent allowed while respecting copyright and the wishes of culture-bearers. The data are cross-indexed with the Database of Peoples, Languages, and Cultures (D-PLACE) to allow researchers to test hypotheses about worldwide coevolution of aesthetic patterns and traditions.

38662570,CORDAX web server: an online platform for the prediction and 3D visualization of aggregation motifs in protein sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteins, the molecular workhorses of biological systems, execute a multitude of critical functions dictated by their precise three-dimensional structures. In a complex and dynamic cellular environment, proteins can undergo misfolding, leading to the formation of aggregates that take up various forms, including amorphous and ordered aggregation in the shape of amyloid fibrils. This phenomenon is closely linked to a spectrum of widespread debilitating pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-II diabetes, and several other proteinopathies, but also hampers the engineering of soluble agents, as in the case of antibody development. As such, the accurate prediction of aggregation propensity within protein sequences has become pivotal due to profound implications in understanding disease mechanisms, as well as in improving biotechnological and therapeutic applications.<h4>Results</h4>We previously developed Cordax, a structure-based predictor that utilizes logistic regression to detect aggregation motifs in protein sequences based on their structural complementarity to the amyloid cross-beta architecture. Here, we present a dedicated web server interface for Cordax. This online platform combines several features including detailed scoring of sequence aggregation propensity, as well as 3D visualization with several customization options for topology models of the structural cores formed by predicted aggregation motifs. In addition, information is provided on experimentally determined aggregation-prone regions that exhibit sequence similarity to predicted motifs, scores, and links to other predictor outputs, as well as simultaneous predictions of relevant sequence propensities, such as solubility, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure propensity.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Cordax webserver is freely accessible at https://cordax.switchlab.org/.",True,False,5.5,,,cordax,20.78051543,ok,,,,spacy+v2,0.78051543,CORDAX web server,True,5.0,False,False,https://cordax.switchlab.org/,https://cordax.switchlab.org/,True,...</h4>The Cordax webserver is freely accessible at https://cordax.switchlab.org/.,1

This concept can also be extended to three or more genes for SL. Computational and experimental methods have been developed to predict and verify SL gene pairs, especially for yeast and Escherichia coli. However, there is currently a lack of a specialized platform to collect microbial SL gene pairs. Therefore, we designed a synthetic interaction database for microbial genetics that collects 13,313 SL and 2,994 Synthetic Rescue (SR) gene pairs that are reported in the literature, as well as 86,981 putative SL pairs got through homologous transfer method in 281 bacterial genomes. Our database website provides multiple functions such as search, browse, visualization, and Blast. Based on the SL interaction data in the S. cerevisiae, we review the issue of duplications' essentiality and observed that the duplicated genes and singletons have a similar ratio of being essential when we consider both individual and SL.

The design process of base editors is labour-intensive and outcomes are not easily predictable. For any clinical use, base editing has to be accurate and efficient. Thus, any bystander mutations have to be minimized. In recent years, computational models to predict base editing outcomes have been developed. However, the overall robustness and performance of those models is limited. One way to improve the performance is to train models on a diverse, feature-rich, and large dataset, which does not exist for the base editing field.

37143876,LDRGDb - Legumes disease resistance genes database.,"Legumes comprise one of the world's largest, most diverse, and economically important plant families, known for their nutritional and medicinal benefits. Legumes are susceptible to a wide range of diseases, similar to other agricultural crops. Diseases have a considerable impact on the production of legume crop species, resulting in large yield losses worldwide. Due to continuous interactions between plants and their pathogens in the environment and the evolution of new pathogens under high selection pressure; disease resistant genes emerge in plant cultivars in the field against those pathogens or disease. Thus, disease resistant genes play critical roles in plant resistance responses, and their discovery and subsequent use in breeding programmes aid in reducing yield loss. The genomic era, with its high-throughput and low-cost genomic tools, has revolutionised our understanding of the complex interactions between legumes and pathogens, resulting in the identification of several critical participants in both the resistant and susceptible relationships. However, a substantial amount of existing information about numerous legume species has been disseminated as text or is preserved across fractions in different databases, posing a challenge for researchers. As a result, the range, scope, and complexity of these resources pose challenges to those who manage and use them. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop tools and a single conjugate database to manage genetic information for the world's plant genetic resources, allowing for the rapid incorporation of essential resistance genes into breeding strategies.

36300618,The protein common assembly database (ProtCAD)-a comprehensive structural resource of protein complexes.,"Proteins often act through oligomeric interactions with other proteins. X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy provide detailed information on the structures of biological assemblies, defined as the most likely biologically relevant structures derived from experimental data. In crystal structures, the most relevant assembly may be ambiguously determined, since multiple assemblies observed in the crystal lattice may be plausible. It is estimated that 10-15% of PDB entries may have incorrect or ambiguous assembly annotations. Accurate assemblies are required for understanding functional data and training of deep learning methods for predicting assembly structures. As with any other kind of biological data, replication via multiple independent experiments provides important validation for the determination of biological assembly structures. Here we present the Protein Common Assembly Database (ProtCAD), which presents clusters of protein assembly structures observed in independent structure determinations of homologous proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). ProtCAD is searchable by PDB entry, UniProt identifiers, or Pfam domain designations and provides downloads of coordinate files, PyMol scripts, and publicly available assembly annotations for each cluster of assemblies.

Their distribution varies significantly between taxonomic groups in the tree of life and are highly polymorphic within the human population. Advances in sequencing technologies coupled with decreasing costs have enabled the generation of an ever-growing number of complete genomes. Additionally, the arrival of accurate long reads has facilitated the generation of Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) assemblies of complete genomes. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive database that encompasses the STRs found per genome across different organisms and for different human genomes across diverse ancestries.

35411390,Scaling up oligogenic diseases research with OLIDA: the Oligogenic Diseases Database.,"Improving the understanding of the oligogenic nature of diseases requires access to high-quality, well-curated Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data. Although first steps were taken with the development of the Digenic Diseases Database, leading to novel computational advancements to assist the field, these were also linked with a number of limitations, for instance, the ad hoc curation protocol and the inclusion of only digenic cases. The OLIgogenic diseases DAtabase (OLIDA) presents a novel, transparent and rigorous curation protocol, introducing a confidence scoring mechanism for the published oligogenic literature. The application of this protocol on the oligogenic literature generated a new repository containing 916 oligogenic variant combinations linked to 159 distinct diseases. Information extracted from the scientific literature is supplemented with current knowledge support obtained from public databases. Each entry is an oligogenic combination linked to a disease, labelled with a confidence score based on the level of genetic and functional evidence that supports its involvement in this disease. These scores allow users to assess the relevance and proof of pathogenicity of each oligogenic combination in the database, constituting markers for reporting improvements on disease-causing oligogenic variant combinations.

38428997,AraLeTA: An Arabidopsis leaf expression atlas across diurnal and developmental scales.,"Mature plant leaves are a composite of distinct cell types, including epidermal, mesophyll, and vascular cells. Notably, the proportion of these cells and the relative transcript concentrations within different cell types may change over time. While gene expression data at a single-cell level can provide cell-type-specific expression values, it is often too expensive to obtain these data for high-resolution time series. Although bulk RNA-seq can be performed in a high-resolution time series, RNA-seq using whole leaves measures average gene expression values across all cell types in each sample. In this study, we combined single-cell RNA-seq data with time-series data from whole leaves to assemble an atlas of cell-type-specific changes in gene expression over time for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We inferred how the relative transcript concentrations of different cell types vary across diurnal and developmental timescales. Importantly, this analysis revealed 3 subgroups of mesophyll cells with distinct temporal profiles of expression. Finally, we developed tissue-specific gene networks that form a community resource: an Arabidopsis Leaf Time-dependent Atlas (AraLeTa).

The assessment of an antibody's developability-its suitability for large-scale production and therapeutic use-is a particularly important step in this process. Given that experimental assays to assess antibody developability in large scale are expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have been a more efficient alternative. However, the antibody research community faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of readily accessible data on antibody developability, which is essential for training and validating computational models. To address this gap, DOTAD (Database Of Therapeutic Antibody Developability) has been built as the first database dedicated exclusively to the curation of therapeutic antibody developability information. DOTAD aggregates all available therapeutic antibody sequence data along with various developability metrics from the scientific literature, offering researchers a robust platform for data storage, retrieval, exploration, and downloading. In addition to serving as a comprehensive repository, DOTAD enhances its utility by integrating a web-based interface that features state-of-the-art tools for the assessment of antibody developability.

The main aim of this bioinformatic tool was to use data from other bioinformatic tools (TMHMM, SOPMA, tRNA-SCAN, RNAfold, ConSurf) for dog and human mitochondrial genes in order to shorten the time necessary for the analysis of the whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as well as amino acid and protein analyses. Each position in the canine mitochondrial genome is assigned a position in genes, in codons, an amino acid position in proteins, or a position in tRNA or rRNA molecules. Therefore, a user analysing changes in the canine and human mitochondrial genome does not need to extract the sequences of individual genes from the mitochondrial genome for analysis and there is no need to rewrite them into amino acid sequences to assess whether the change is synonymous or nonsynonymous. Canis mitoSNP allows the comparison between the human and canine mitochondrial genomes as well. The Clustal W alignment of the dog and human mitochondrial DNA reference sequences for each gene obtained from GenBank (NC_002008.4 dog, NC_012920.1 human) was performed in order to determine which position in the canine mitochondrial genome corresponds to the position in the human mitochondrial genome.

36828269,ProSeqAProDB: Prosequence Assisted Protein Database.,"In early 1990s, several proteins were shown to depend on additional stretches of polypeptide (termed as prosequence/prodomain) for their folding. These regions of the protein were often termed as IMCs (Intra Molecular Chaperones), since they would be cleaved from the mature folded protein eventually. Such proteins were hypothesized to face a kinetic barrier to their folding, which was probably lowered by the prosequences. In last three decades, numerous examples of such proteins have accumulated in literature. Yet, no study has been reported so far attempting to understand the evolutionary differences and similaritess of such proteins. Till date such proteins are continued to be treated as anomalous variants, rather than as representatives of any alternate protein folding strategy. Do such proteins have any distinctive structural facets OR typical biological roles, necessitating an unconventional strategy of protein folding? Do prosequences carry any unique or conserved features that are essential to their function? ProSeqAProDb: ProSequence Assisted Protein Database, (which can be accessed at https://proseqaprodb.mkulab.in) was built as a comprehensive database, to systematically study such proteins along with their pro-sequences. The database currently contains 2140 prosequence assisted proteins (1848 eukaryotic, 255 bacterial, 24 viral and 13 archaeal proteins), from 690 organisms later categorised into 960 families.

EccDNA is emerging as a rising star because of its ubiquitous existence in cancers and its crucial role in oncogene amplification and tumor progression. In the present study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of cancer samples were downloaded from public repositories. Afterwards, eccDNAs were identified from WGS data via bioinformatic analyses. To leverage database coverage, eccDNAs were also collected by manual curation of literatures. Gene expression and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and CCLE and then used to investigate the roles of eccDNAs in cancers. Finally, the first integrated database of eccDNAs, eccDNAdb, was developed. eccDNAdb currently includes 1270 eccDNAs, which were identified in 480 samples (of 42 cancers) after analyzing a total number of 3395 tumor samples (of 57 cancers) including patient tissues, patient-derived xenografts, and cancer cell lines. A total number of 54,901 eccDNA genes were annotated and included in the database as well.

For such annotations, these softwares calculate the <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values of the peptide/protein precursor and fragment ions, for which a database of protein sequences must be provided as an input file. The calculated <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values are stored as another database, which the user usually cannot view. Database Creator for Mass Analysis of Peptides and Proteins (DC-MAPP) is a novel standalone software that can create custom databases for ""viewing"" the calculated <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values of precursor and fragment ions, prior to the database search. It contains three modules. Peptide/Protein sequences as per user's choice can be entered as input to the first module for creating a custom database. In the second module, <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values must be queried-in, which are searched within the custom database to identify protein/peptide sequences. The third module is suited for peptide mass fingerprinting, which can be used to analyze both ESI and MALDI mass spectral data. The feature of ""viewing"" the custom database can be helpful not only for better understanding the search engine processes, but also for designing multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods. Post-translational modifications and protein isoforms can also be analyzed. Since, DC-MAPP relies on the protein/peptide ""sequences"" for creating custom databases, it may not be applicable for the searches involving spectral libraries.

39657145,Probe my Pathway (PmP): a portal to explore the chemical coverage of the human Reactome.,"Deciphering pathway-phenotype associations is critical for a system-wide understanding of cells and the chemistry of life. An approach to reach this goal is to systematically modulate pathways pharmacologically. The targeted and controlled regulation of an increasing number of proteins is becoming possible, thanks to the growing list of chemical probes and chemogenomic compounds available to cell biologists, but no resource is available that directly maps these chemical tools on cellular pathways. To fill this gap, we developed Probe my Pathway (PmP), a database where high-quality chemical probes and well-characterized sets of chemogenomic compounds are mapped on all the human pathways of the Reactome database. The web interface allows users to browse the data via icicle charts or search the data for compounds, proteins, or pathways. Chemists can rapidly find pathways with low chemical coverage or explore the structural chemistry of ligands targeting specific cellular machineries. Cell biologists can look for chemical probes targeting different proteins in the same pathway or find which pathways are targeted by chemical probes of interest.

Research on IBD has generated massive amounts of data, including literature, metagenomics, metabolomics, bioresources and databases. We aim to create an IBD Integrated Resources Portal (IBDIRP) that provides the most comprehensive resources for IBD. An integrated platform was developed that provides information on different aspects of IBD research resources, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes, transcriptome, microbiota, metabolomics, single cells and other resources. Valuable and comprehensive IBD-related data were collected from PubMed, Google, GMrepo, gutMega, gutMDisorder, Single Cell Portal and other sources. Then, the data were systematically sorted, and these resources were manually curated. We systematically sorted and cataloged more than 320 unique risk SNPs associated with IBD in the SNP section. We presented over 289 IBD-related genes based on the database collection in the gene section. We also obtained 153 manually curated IBD transcriptomics data, including 12 388 samples, on the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The sorted IBD-related microbiota data from three primary microbiome databases (GMrepo, gutMega and gutMDisorder) were available for download. We selected 23 149 IBD-related taxonomic records from these databases. Additionally, we collected 24 IBD metabolomics studies with 2896 participants in the metabolomics section.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as effective mediators for the communication both within and between species. They can carry and transport molecular cargoes to transmit biological messages. Several databases (ExoBCD, ExoCarta, EVpedia, EV-TRACK, Vesiclepedia) complied the cargoes information including DNA, RNA, protein, lipid and metabolite associated with EVs. Databases that refer to the complete records on both donor and recipient information are warranted to facilitate the understanding of the interaction across cells and species. In this study, we developed a database that compiled the records equipped with a structured process of EV-mediated interaction. The sources of donor and recipient were classified by cell type, tissues/organs and species, thus providing an extended knowledge of cell-cell, species-species interaction. The isolation and identification methods were presented for assessing the quality of EVs. Information on functional cargoes was included, where microRNA was linked to a prediction server to broaden its potential effects. Physiological and pathological context was marked to show the environment where EVs functioned. At present, a total of 1481 data records in our database, including 971 cell-cell interactions belonging to more than 40 different tissues/organs, and 510 cross-species records. The database provides a web interface to browse, search, visualize and download the interaction records. Users can search for interactions by selecting the context of interest or specific cells/species types, as well as functional cargoes.

Numerous methods have been developed for handling class imbalance, but they are not readily accessible to users with limited computational experience. Moreover, there is no resource that enables users to easily evaluate the effect of different over-sampling algorithms.<h4>Results</h4>METAbolomics data Balancing with Over-sampling Algorithms (META-BOA) is a web-based application that enables users to select between four different methods for class balancing, followed by data visualization and classification of the sample to observe the augmentation effects. META-BOA outputs a newly balanced dataset, generating additional samples in the minority class, according to the user's choice of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Borderline-SMOTE (BSMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) or Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE). To present the effect of over-sampling on the data META-BOA further displays both principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding visualization of data pre- and post-over-sampling. Random forest classification is utilized to compare sample classification in both the original and balanced datasets, enabling users to select the most appropriate method for their further analyses.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>META-BOA is available at https://complimet.ca/meta-boa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,,meta-boa,16.99757975,ok,,metabolomics | balancing with over-sampling algorithms,meta | boa | eta-boa,v2,0.99757975,METAbolomics data Balancing with Over-sampling Algorithms,True,3.0,False,False,https://complimet.ca/meta-boa,https://complimet.ca/meta-boa,True,...y and implementation</h4>META-BOA is available at https://complimet.ca/meta-boa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1

37337236,The Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database (CAMHRED): tools and methods for local evidence mapping.,"<h4>Background</h4>Local evidence is important for contextualized knowledge translation. It can be used to adapt global recommendations, to identify future research priorities and inform local policy decisions. However, there are challenges in identifying local evidence in a systematic, comprehensive, and timely manner. There is limited guidance on how to map local evidence and provide it to users in an accessible and user-friendly way. In this study, we address these issues by describing the methods for the development of a centralized database of health research evidence for Cameroon and its applications for research prioritization and decision making.<h4>Methods</h4>We searched 10 electronic health databases and hand-searched the archives of non-indexed African and Cameroonian journals. We screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of peer reviewed journal articles published between 1999 and 2019 in English or French that assess health related outcomes in Cameroonian populations. We extracted relevant study characteristics based on a pre-established guide. We developed a coding scheme or taxonomy of content areas so that local evidence is mapped to corresponding domains and subdomains. Pairs of reviewers coded articles independently and resolved discrepancies by consensus. Moreover, we developed guidance on how to search the database, use search results to create evidence maps and conduct knowledge gap analyses.<h4>Results</h4>The Cameroon Health Research and Evidence Database (CAMHRED) is a bilingual centralized online portal of local evidence on health in Cameroon from 1999 onwards. It currently includes 4384 studies categorized into content domains and study characteristics (design, setting, year and language of publication). The database is searchable by keywords or through a guided search. Results including abstracts, relevant study characteristics and bibliographic information are available for users to download. Upon request, guidance on how to optimize search results for applications like evidence maps and knowledge gap analyses is also available.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CAMHRED ( https://camhred.org/ ) is a systematic, comprehensive, and centralized resource for local evidence about health in Cameroon.

37953323,ncRNADrug: a database for validated and predicted ncRNAs associated with drug resistance and targeted by drugs.,"Drug resistance is a major barrier in cancer treatment and anticancer drug development. Growing evidence indicates that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play pivotal roles in cancer progression, therapy, and drug resistance. Furthermore, ncRNAs have been proven to be promising novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Reversing dysregulated ncRNAs by drugs holds significant potential as an effective therapeutic strategy for overcoming drug resistance. Therefore, we developed ncRNADrug, an integrated and comprehensive resource that records manually curated and computationally predicted ncRNAs associated with drug resistance, ncRNAs targeted by drugs, as well as potential drug combinations for the treatment of resistant cancer. Currently, ncRNADrug collects 29 551 experimentally validated entries involving 9195 ncRNAs (2248 miRNAs, 4145 lncRNAs and 2802 circRNAs) associated with the drug resistance of 266 drugs, and 32 969 entries involving 10 480 ncRNAs (4338 miRNAs, 6087 lncRNAs and 55 circRNAs) targeted by 965 drugs. In addition, ncRNADrug also contains associations between ncRNAs and drugs predicted from ncRNA expression profiles by differential expression analysis.

37154702,GTExVisualizer: a web platform for supporting ageing studies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Studying ageing effects on molecules is an important new topic for life science. To perform such studies, the need for data, models, algorithms, and tools arises to elucidate molecular mechanisms. GTEx (standing for Genotype-Tissue Expression) portal is a web-based data source allowing to retrieve patients' transcriptomics data annotated with tissues, gender, and age information. It represents the more complete data sources for ageing effects studies. Nevertheless, it lacks functionalities to query data at the sex/age level, as well as tools for protein interaction studies, thereby limiting ageing studies. As a result, users need to download query results to proceed to further analysis, such as retrieving the expression of a given gene on different age (or sex) classes in many tissues.<h4>Results</h4>We present the GTExVisualizer, a platform to query and analyse GTEx data. This tool contains a web interface able to: (i) graphically represent and study query results; (ii) analyse genes using sex/age expression patterns, also integrated with network-based modules; and (iii) report results as plot-based representation as well as (gene) networks. Finally, it allows the user to obtain basic statistics which evidence differences in gene expression among sex/age groups.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The GTExVisualizer novelty consists in providing a tool for studying ageing/sex-related effects on molecular processes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>GTExVisualizer is available at: http://gtexvisualizer.herokuapp.com.

38865432,IPAD-DB: a manually curated database for experimentally verified inhibitors of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a universal neurodegenerative disease with the feature of progressive dementia. Currently, there are only seven Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of AD, which merely offer temporary relief from symptom deterioration without reversing the underlying disease process. The identification of inhibitors capable of interacting with proteins associated with AD plays a pivotal role in the development of effective therapeutic interventions. However, a vast number of such inhibitors are dispersed throughout numerous published articles, rendering it inconvenient for researchers to explore potential drug candidates for AD. In light of this, we have manually compiled inhibitors targeting proteins associated with AD and constructed a comprehensive database known as IPAD-DB (Inhibitors of Proteins associated with Alzheimer's Disease Database). The curated inhibitors within this database encompass a diverse range of compounds, including natural compounds, synthetic compounds, drugs, natural extracts and nano-inhibitors. To date, the database has compiled >4800 entries, each representing a correspondent relationship between an inhibitor and its target protein. IPAD-DB offers a user-friendly interface that facilitates browsing, searching and downloading of its records. We firmly believe that IPAD-DB represents a valuable resource for screening potential AD drug candidates and investigating the underlying mechanisms of this debilitating disease.

In total, 765,248 olfactory receptor genes were annotated, with 404,426 functional genes and 360,822 pseudogenes, which represents a four-fold increase in the number of annotated olfactory receptors. Based on the annotation data, we built a database called Chordata Olfactory Receptor Database (CORD, https://cord.ihuman.shanghaitech.edu.cn ) for archiving, analysing and disseminating the data. Beyond the primary data, we offer derivative information, including pictures of species, cross references to public databases, structural models, sequence similarity networks and sequence profiles in the CORD. Furthermore, we did brief analyses on these receptors, including building a huge protein sequence similarity network covering all receptors in the database, and clustering them into 20 communities, classifying the 20 communities into three categories based on their presences/absences in ray-finned fish and/or lobe-finned fish.

37947313,AFRbase: a database of protein mutations responsible for antifungal resistance.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Fungal pathogens are known to cause life threatening invasive infections with rising global mortality rates. Besides, the indiscriminate use of antifungals in both clinics and agriculture has promoted antifungal drug resistance in the last decade. Fungi can show drug resistance by a variety of mechanisms. But primary driver in all these hitherto documented mechanisms is stable and heritable point mutations in the key proteins. Therefore, cataloguing mutations that can confer resistance is the first step toward understanding the mechanisms leading to the emergence of antifungal resistance.<h4>Results</h4>In the present, work we have described a database of all the mutations responsible for antifungal resistance. Named as antifungal resistance database (AFRbase), it is better than the existing databases of antifungal resistance namely, FunResDB and MARDy which have a limited scope and inadequate information. Data of AFRbase was collected using both text mining and manual curation. AFRbase provides a separate window for visualization of mutations in the 2D and 3D formats making it easy for researchers to analyze the mutation data and ensures interoperability with other standard molecular biology databases like NCBI and UniProtKB. We hope AFRbase can be useful to both clinicians and basic biomedical scientists as we envision it as an important resource for genotypic susceptibility testing of fungi and to study/predict the course of evolution of antifungal resistance. The current version of AFRbase contains manually curated 3691 unique mutations present in 29 proteins of 32 fungal species along with the information of drugs against which resistance is caused.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AFRbase is an open access database available at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/.",True,False,5.0,,,frbase,16.9949348,ok,,afrbase | antifungal resistance database | funresdb | uniprotkb,mardy,v2,0.9949348,AFRbase,True,5.0,False,False,http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/,http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/,True,...4>AFRbase is an open access database available at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/afrbase/.,1

39702552,The EstroGene2.0 database for endocrine therapy response and resistance in breast cancer.,"Endocrine therapies targeting the estrogen receptor (ER/ESR1) are the cornerstone to treat ER-positive breast cancers patients, but resistance often limits their effectiveness. Notable progress has been made although the fragmented way data is reported has reduced their potential impact. Here, we introduce EstroGene2.0, an expanded database of its precursor 1.0 version. EstroGene2.0 focusses on response and resistance to endocrine therapies in breast cancer models. Incorporating multi-omic profiling of 361 experiments from 212 studies across 28 cell lines, a user-friendly browser offers comprehensive data visualization and metadata mining capabilities ( https://estrogeneii.web.app/ ). Taking advantage of the harmonized data collection, our follow-up meta-analysis revealed transcriptomic landscape and substantial diversity in response to different classes of ER modulators. Endocrine-resistant models exhibit a spectrum of transcriptomic alterations including a contra-directional shift in ER and interferon signalings, which is recapitulated clinically. Dissecting multiple ESR1-mutant cell models revealed the different clinical relevance of cell model engineering and identified high-confidence mutant-ER targets, such as NPY1R.

38426331,HIResist: a database of HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Changing the course of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) pandemic is a high public health priority with approximately 39 million people currently living with HIV-1 (PLWH) and about 1.5 million new infections annually worldwide. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) typically target highly conserved sites on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), which mediate viral entry, and block the infection of diverse HIV-1 strains. But different mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs prevent robust application of bnAbs for therapeutic and preventive interventions.<h4>Results</h4>Here we report the development of a new database that provides data and computational tools to aid the discovery of resistant features and may assist in analysis of HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs. Bioinformatic tools allow identification of specific patterns in Env sequences of resistant strains and development of strategies to elucidate the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape; comparison of resistant and sensitive HIV-1 strains for each bnAb; identification of resistance and sensitivity signatures associated with specific bnAbs or groups of bnAbs; and visualization of antibody pairs on cross-sensitivity plots. The database has been designed with a particular focus on user-friendly and interactive interface.

Although global gene transcription is widely explored and abundantly available, our understanding of microprotein functions using transcriptome data is still limited. To mitigate this problem, we present a database, Mip-mining ( https://weilab.sjtu.edu.cn/mipmining/ ), underpinned by high-quality RNA-sequencing data exclusively aimed at analyzing microprotein functions. The Mip-mining hosts 336 sets of high-quality transcriptome data from 8626 samples and nine representative living organisms, including microorganisms, plants, animals, and humans, in our Mip-mining database. Our database specifically provides a focus on a range of diseases and environmental stress conditions, taking into account chemical, physical, biological, and diseases-related stresses. Comparatively, our platform enables customized analysis by inputting desired data sets with self-determined cutoff values. The practicality of Mip-mining is demonstrated by identifying essential microproteins in different species and revealing the importance of ATP15 in the acetic acid stress tolerance of budding yeast.

39569321,Exon nomenclature and classification of transcripts database (ENACTdb): a resource for analyzing alternative splicing mediated proteome diversity.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Gene transcripts are distinguished by the composition of their exons, and this different exon composition may contribute to advancing proteome complexity. Despite the availability of alternative splicing information documented in various databases, a ready association of exonic variations to the protein sequence remains a mammoth task.<h4>Results</h4>To associate exonic variation(s) with the protein systematically, we designed the Exon Nomenclature and Classification of Transcripts (ENACT) framework for uniquely annotating exons that tracks their loci in gene architecture context with encapsulating variations in splice site(s) and amino acid coding status. After ENACT annotation, predicted protein features (secondary structure/disorder/Pfam domains) are mapped to exon attributes. Thus, ENACTdb provides trackable exonic variation(s) association to isoform(s) and protein features, enabling the assessment of functional variation due to changes in exon composition. Such analyses can be readily performed through multiple views supported by the server. The exon-centric visualizations of ENACT annotated isoforms could provide insights on the functional repertoire of genes due to alternative splicing and its related processes and can serve as an important resource for the research community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The database is publicly available at https://www.iscbglab.in/enactdb/.

39341494,GEPREP: A comprehensive data atlas of RNA-seq-based gene expression profiles of exercise responses.,"<h4>Background</h4>Physical activity can regulate and affect gene expression in multiple tissues and cells. Recently, with the development of next-generation sequencing, a large number of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)-based gene expression profiles about physical activity have been shared in public resources; however, they are poorly curated and underutilized. To tackle this problem, we developed a data atlas of such data through comprehensive data collection, curation, and organization.<h4>Methods</h4>The data atlas, termed gene expression profiles of RNA-seq-based exercise responses (GEPREP), was built on a comprehensive collection of high-quality RNA-seq data on exercise responses. The metadata of each sample were manually curated. Data were uniformly processed and batch effects corrected. All the information was well organized in an easy-to-use website for free search, visualization, and download.<h4>Results</h4>GEPREP now includes 69 RNA-seq datasets of pre- and post-exercise, comprising 26 human datasets (1120 samples) and 43 mouse datasets (1006 samples). Specifically, there were 977 (87.2 %) human samples of skeletal muscle and 143 (12.8 %) human samples of blood. There were also samples across 9 mice tissues with skeletal muscle (359, 35.7 %) and brain (280, 27.8 %) accounting for the main fractions.

36179089,CITEdb: a manually curated database of cell-cell interactions in human.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The interactions among various types of cells play critical roles in cell functions and the maintenance of the entire organism. While cell-cell interactions are traditionally revealed from experimental studies, recent developments in single-cell technologies combined with data mining methods have enabled computational prediction of cell-cell interactions, which have broadened our understanding of how cells work together, and have important implications in therapeutic interventions targeting cell-cell interactions for cancers and other diseases. Despite the importance, to our knowledge, there is no database for systematic documentation of high-quality cell-cell interactions at the cell type level, which hinders the development of computational approaches to identify cell-cell interactions.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a publicly accessible database, CITEdb (Cell-cell InTEraction database, https://citedb.cn/), which not only facilitates interactive exploration of cell-cell interactions in specific physiological contexts (e.g. a disease or an organ) but also provides a benchmark dataset to interpret and evaluate computationally derived cell-cell interactions from different tools.

39677536,The FAIR database: facilitating access to public health research literature.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>In public health, access to research literature is critical to informing decision-making and to identify knowledge gaps. However, identifying relevant research is not a straightforward task since public health interventions are often complex, can have positive and negative impacts on health inequalities and are applied in diverse and rapidly evolving settings. We developed a ""living"" database of public health research literature to facilitate access to this information using Natural Language Processing tools.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Classifiers were identified to identify the study design (eg, cohort study or clinical trial) and relationship to factors that may be relevant to inequalities using the PROGRESS-Plus classification scheme. Training data were obtained from existing MEDLINE labels and from a set of systematic reviews in which studies were annotated with PROGRESS-Plus categories.<h4>Results</h4>Evaluation of the classifiers showed that the study type classifier achieved average precision and recall of 0.803 and 0.930, respectively. The PROGRESS-Plus classification proved more challenging with average precision and recall of 0.608 and 0.534. The FAIR database uses information provided by these classifiers to facilitate access to inequality-related public health literature.<h4>Discussion</h4>Previous work on automation of evidence synthesis has focused on clinical areas rather than public health, despite the need being arguably greater.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The development of the FAIR database demonstrates that it is possible to create a publicly accessible and regularly updated database of public health research literature focused on inequalities.

39944812,"GlucoGenes®, a database of genes and proteins associated with glucose metabolism disorders, its description and applications in bioinformatics research.","Data on the genetics and molecular biology of diabetes are accumulating rapidly. This poses the challenge of creating research tools for a rapid search for, structuring and analysis of information in this field. We have developed a web resource, GlucoGenes®, which includes a database and an Internet portal of genes and proteins associated with high glucose (hyperglycemia), low glucose (hypoglycemia), and both metabolic disorders. The data were collected using text mining of the publications indexed in PubMed and PubMed Central and analysis of gene networks associated with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and glucose variability performed with ANDSystems, a bioinformatics tool. GlucoGenes® is freely available at: https://glucogenes.sysbio.ru/genes/main. GlucoGenes® enables users to access and download information about genes and proteins associated with the risk of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, molecular regulators with hyperglycemic and antihyperglycemic activity, genes up-regulated by high glucose and/or low glucose, genes down-regulated by high glucose and/or low glucose, and molecules otherwise associated with the glucose metabolism disorders. With GlucoGenes®, an evolutionary analysis of genes associated with glucose metabolism disorders was performed. The results of the analysis revealed a significant increase (up to 40 %) in the proportion of genes with phylostratigraphic age index (PAI) values corresponding to the time of origin of multicellular organisms. Analysis of sequence conservation using the divergence index (DI) showed that most of the corresponding genes are highly conserved (DI < 0.6) or conservative (DI < 1). When analyzing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the proximal regions of promoters affecting the affinity of the TATA-binding protein, 181 SNP markers were found in the GlucoGenes® database, which can reduce (45 SNP markers) or increase (136 SNP markers) the expression of 52 genes.

39540421,miRNATissueAtlas 2025: an update to the uniformly processed and annotated human and mouse non-coding RNA tissue atlas.,"MiRNAs represent a non-coding RNA class that regulate gene expression and pathways. While miRNAs are evolutionary conserved most data stems from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. As miRNA expression is highly tissue specific, we developed miRNATissueAtlas to comprehensively explore this landscape in H. sapiens. We expanded the H. sapiens tissue repertoire and included M. musculus. In past years, the number of public miRNA expression datasets has grown substantially. Our previous releases of the miRNATissueAtlas represent a great framework for a uniformly pre-processed and label-harmonized resource containing information on these datasets. We incorporate the respective data in the newest release, miRNATissueAtlas 2025, which contains expressions from 9 classes of ncRNA from 799 billion reads across 61 593 samples for H. sapiens and M. musculus. The number of organs and tissues has increased from 28 and 54 to 74 and 373, respectively. This number includes physiological tissues, cell lines and extracellular vesicles. New tissue specificity index calculations build atop the knowledge of previous iterations. Calculations from cell lines enable comparison with physiological tissues, providing a valuable resource for translational research. Finally, between H. sapiens and M. musculus, 35 organs overlap, allowing cross-species comparisons.

The MalariaGEN data resources are the world's largest whole genome sequencing databases for Plasmodium parasites. The size and complexity of such data is a barrier to many potential end users in both public health and academic research. A user-friendly method for accessing and exploring data on the genetic variation of P. falciparum would greatly enable efforts in studying and controlling malaria.<h4>Results</h4>We developed Pf-HaploAtlas, a web application enabling exploratory data analysis of genomic variation without requiring advanced technical expertise. The app provides analysis-ready data catalogues and visualizations of amino acid haplotypes for all 5102 core P. falciparum genes. Pf-HaploAtlas facilitates comprehensive spatial and temporal exploration of genes and variants of interest by using data from 16 203 samples, from 33 countries, and spread between the years 1984 and 2018.

39540430,The secondary metabolism collaboratory: a database and web discussion portal for secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters.,"Secondary metabolites are small molecules produced by all corners of life, often with specialized bioactive functions with clinical and environmental relevance. Secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can often be identified within DNA sequences by various sequence similarity tools, but determining the exact functions of genes in the pathway and predicting their chemical products can often only be done by careful, manual comparative analysis. To facilitate this, we report the first release of the secondary metabolism collaboratory (SMC), which aims to provide a comprehensive, tool-agnostic repository of BGC sequence data drawn from all publicly available and user-submitted bacterial and archaeal genome and contig sources. On the website, users are provided a searchable catalog of putative BGCs identified from each source, along with visualizations of gene and domain annotations derived from multiple sequence analysis tools. SMC's data is also available through publicly-accessible application programming interface (API) endpoints to facilitate programmatic access. Users are encouraged to share their findings (and search for others') through comment posts on BGC and source pages.

38736683,rNMPID: a database for riboNucleoside MonoPhosphates in DNA.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) are the most abundant non-standard nucleotides embedded in genomic DNA. If the presence of rNMP in DNA cannot be controlled, it can lead to genome instability. The actual regulatory functions of rNMPs in DNA remain mainly unknown. Considering the association between rNMP embedment and various diseases and cancer, the phenomenon of rNMP embedment in DNA has become a prominent area of research in recent years.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce the rNMPID database, which is the first database revealing rNMP-embedment characteristics, strand bias, and preferred incorporation patterns in the genomic DNA of samples from bacterial to human cells of different genetic backgrounds. The rNMPID database uses datasets generated by different rNMP-mapping techniques. It provides the researchers with a solid foundation to explore the features of rNMP embedded in the genomic DNA of multiple sources, and their association with cellular functions, and, in future, disease.

With the advancement of sequencing technologies, a large volume of chromatin accessibility data has been accumulated and integrated for humans and other mammals. These data have greatly advanced the study of disease pathogenesis, cancer survival prognosis, and tissue development. To advance the understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating plant key traits and biological processes, we developed a comprehensive plant chromatin accessibility database (PlantCADB) from 649 samples of 37 species. These samples are abiotic stress-related (such as heat, cold, drought, and salt; 159 samples), development-related (232 samples), and/or tissue-specific (376 samples). Overall, 18,339,426 accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) were compiled. These ACRs were annotated with genomic information, associated genes, transcription factor footprint, motif, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, PlantCADB provides various tools to visualize ACRs and corresponding annotations.

38411627,PlantFUNCO: Integrative Functional Genomics Database Reveals Clues into Duplicates Divergence Evolution.,"Evolutionary epigenomics and, more generally, evolutionary functional genomics, are emerging fields that study how non-DNA-encoded alterations in gene expression regulation are an important form of plasticity and adaptation. Previous evidence analyzing plants' comparative functional genomics has mostly focused on comparing same assay-matched experiments, missing the power of heterogeneous datasets for conservation inference. To fill this gap, we developed PlantFUN(ctional)CO(nservation) database, which is constituted by several tools and two main resources: interspecies chromatin states and functional genomics conservation scores, presented and analyzed in this work for three well-established plant models (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Zea mays). Overall, PlantFUNCO elucidated evolutionary information in terms of cross-species functional agreement. Therefore, providing a new complementary comparative-genomics source for assessing evolutionary studies. To illustrate the potential applications of this database, we replicated two previously published models predicting genetic redundancy in A. thaliana and found that chromatin states are a determinant of paralogs degree of functional divergence. These predictions were validated based on the phenotypes of mitochondrial alternative oxidase knockout mutants under two different stressors. Taking all the above into account, PlantFUNCO aim to leverage data diversity and extrapolate molecular mechanisms findings from different model organisms to determine the extent of functional conservation, thus, deepening our understanding of how plants epigenome and functional noncoding genome have evolved.

40360995,GEDG: gene expression database of grape.,"<h4>Background</h4>Grapes are one of the oldest cultivated fruit species in the world, known for their high nutritional value. Grapes and grape products, including wine, are significant to many economies worldwide. Both abiotic and biotic stresses significantly impact the growth and reproduction of grapevines. RNA-Seq is a key tool for studying gene expression patterns under various conditions, such as stress responses, growth and developmental stages. In order to optimise the utilisation of these data for comprehensive research and analysis, and to enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a comprehensive database that provides gene expression profiles and traits in grapes.<h4>Description</h4>We have developed the gene expression database for grapes (GEDG), an online resource that encompasses data on 9 types of abiotic (including heat, cold, hormones, light, climate, nitrogen, frozen) and biotic (disease and pests) stresses and different developmental stages. A total of 32 datasets were related to stress, 20 to growth and development, and one to chromosomal ploidy. The primary objective of GEDG is to expand and utilize transcriptome data to better understand stress responses in grapes. GEDG is the comprehensive database to integrate transcriptome and traits on grape.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Gene Expression Database of Grape (GEDG) was created to serve as a free resource platform for researchers, offering a comprehensive collection of genetic expression profiles for grape varieties based on RNA-seq data.

37270525,ABPEPserver: a web application for documentation and analysis of substitutants.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cancer immunotherapy is implemented by identifying antigens that are presented on the cell surface of cancer cells and illicit T-cell response (Schumacher and Schreiber, Science 348:69-74, 2015; Waldman et al., Nat Rev Immunol 20:651-668, 2020; Zhang et al., Front Immunol 12:672,356, 2021b). Classical candidates of such antigens are the peptides resulting from genetic alterations and are named ""neoantigen"" (Schumacher and Schreiber, Science 348:69-74, 2015). Neoantigens have been widely catalogued across several human cancer types (Tan et al., Database (Oxford) 2020;2020b; Vigneron et al., Cancer Immun 13:15, 2013; Yi et al., iScience 24:103,107, 2021; Zhang et al., BMC Bioinformatics 22:40, 2021a). Recently, a new class of inducible antigens has been identified, namely Substitutants, that are produced as a result of aberrant protein translation (Pataskar et al., Nature 603:721-727, 2022). MAIN: Catalogues of Substitutant expression across human cancer types, their specificity and association to gene expression signatures remain elusive for the scientific community's access. As a solution, we present ABPEPserver, an online database and analytical platform that can visualize a large-scale tumour proteomics analysis of Substitutant expression across eight tumour types sourced from the CPTAC database (Edwards et al., J Proteome Res 14:2707-2713, 2015). Functionally, ABPEPserver offers the analysis of gene-association signatures of Substitutant peptides, a comparison of enrichment between tumour and tumour-adjacent normal tissues, and a list of peptides that serve as candidates for immunotherapy design. ABPEPserver will significantly enhance the exploration of aberrant protein production in human cancer, as exemplified in a case study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ABPEPserver is designed on an R SHINY platform to catalogue Substitutant peptides in human cancer.

PTM is involved in various cell signaling pathways and biological processes. Abnormal PTM status is closely associated with severe diseases (such as cancer and neurologic diseases) by regulating protein functions, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs). A set of databases was constructed separately for PTM sites and PPI; however, the resource of regulation for PTM on PPI is still unsolved.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we firstly constructed a public accessible database of PTMint (PTMs that are associated with PPIs) (https://ptmint.sjtu.edu.cn/) that contains manually curated complete experimental evidence of the PTM regulation on PPIs in multiple organisms, including Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

37391755,Meta-research on pragmatism of randomized trials: rationale and design of the PragMeta database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Pragmatic trials provide decision-oriented, real-world evidence that is highly applicable and generalizable. The interest in real-world evidence is fueled by the assumption that effects in the ""real-world"" are different to effects obtained under artificial, controlled, research conditions as often used for traditional explanatory trials. However, it is unknown which features of pragmatism, generalizability, and applicability would be responsible for such differences. There is a need to provide empirical evidence and promote meta-research to answer these fundamental questions on the pragmatism of randomized trials and real-world evidence. Here, we describe the rationale and design of the PragMeta database which pursues this goal ( www.PragMeta.org ).<h4>Methods</h4>PragMeta is a non-commercial, open data platform and infrastructure to facilitate research on pragmatic trials. It collects and shares data from published randomized trials that either have a specific design feature or other characteristic related to pragmatism or they form clusters of trials addressing the same research question but having different aspects of pragmatism. This lays the foundation to determine the relationship of various features of pragmatism, generalizability, and applicability with intervention effects or other trial characteristics. The database contains trial data actively collected for PragMeta but also allows to import and link existing datasets of trials collected for other purposes, forming a large-scale meta-database. PragMeta captures data on (1) trial and design characteristics (e.g., sample size, population, intervention/comparison, outcome, longitudinal structure, blinding), (2) effects estimates, and (3) various determinants of pragmatism (e.g., the use of routinely collected data) and ratings from established tools used to determine pragmatism (e.g., the PRagmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary 2; PRECIS-2). PragMeta is continuously provided online, inviting the meta-research community to collaborate, contribute, and/or use the database.

37308034,Multi-ethnic Imputation System (MI-System): A genotype imputation server for high-dimensional data.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Genotype imputation is a commonly used technique that infers un-typed variants into a study's genotype data, allowing better identification of causal variants in disease studies. However, due to overrepresentation of Caucasian studies, there's a lack of understanding of genetic basis of health-outcomes in other ethnic populations. Therefore, facilitating imputation of missing key-predictor-variants that can potentially improve a risk health-outcome prediction model, specifically for Asian ancestry, is of utmost relevance.<h4>Methods</h4>We aimed to construct an imputation and analysis web-platform, that primarily facilitates, but is not limited to genotype imputation on East-Asians. The goal is to provide a collaborative imputation platform for researchers in the public domain towards rapidly and efficiently conducting accurate genotype imputation.<h4>Results</h4>We present an online genotype imputation platform, Multi-ethnic Imputation System (MI-System) (https://misystem.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/), that offers users 3 established pipelines, SHAPEIT2-IMPUTE2, SHAPEIT4-IMPUTE5, and Beagle5.1 for conducting imputation analyses. In addition to 1000 Genomes and Hapmap3, a new customized Taiwan Biobank (TWB) reference panel, specifically created for Taiwanese-Chinese ancestry is provided. MI-System further offers functions to create customized reference panels to be used for imputation, conduct quality control, split whole genome data into chromosomes, and convert genome builds.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Users can upload their genotype data and perform imputation with minimum effort and resources. The utility functions further can be utilized to preprocess user uploaded data with easy clicks. MI-System potentially contributes to Asian-population genetics research, while eliminating the requirement for high performing computational resources and bioinformatics expertise. It will enable an increased pace of research and provide a knowledge-base for genetic carriers of complex diseases, therefore greatly enhancing patient-driven research.<h4>Statement of significance</h4>Multi-ethnic Imputation System (MI-System), primarily facilitates, but is not limited to, imputation on East-Asians, through 3 established prephasing-imputation pipelines, SHAPEIT2-IMPUTE2, SHAPEIT4-IMPUTE5, and Beagle5.1, where users can upload their genotype data and perform imputation and other utility functions with minimum effort and resources.

Experimental methods can fail to provide all the information required to fully model biomolecular complexes at atomic resolution, particularly for large and heterogeneous assemblies. Integrative computational approaches have, therefore, gained popularity, complementing traditional experimental methods in structural biology. Here, we introduce HADDOCK2.4, an integrative modeling platform, and its updated web interface ( https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4 ). The platform seamlessly integrates diverse experimental and theoretical data to generate high-quality models of macromolecular complexes. The user-friendly web server offers automated parameter settings, access to distributed computing resources, and pre- and post-processing steps that enhance the user experience. To present the web server's various interfaces and features, we demonstrate two different applications: (i) we predict the structure of an antibody-antigen complex by using NMR data for the antigen and knowledge of the hypervariable loops for the antibody, and (ii) we perform coarse-grained modeling of PRC1 with a nucleosome particle guided by mutagenesis and functional data.

This is the largest normative study conducted so far that relies on subjective ratings. Unlike the few existing normative studies, which mainly comprise face emojis, here we present a wide range of emoji categories. We also examine the correlations between the dimensions assessed. Our results show that, in terms of their affective properties, emojis are analogous to other stimuli, such as words, showing the expected U-shaped relationship between valence and arousal. The relationship between affective properties and other dimensions (e.g., between valence and familiarity) is also similar to the relationship observed in words, in the sense that positively valenced emojis are more familiar than negative ones. These findings suggest that emojis are suitable stimuli for studying affective processing.

Current miRNA-related SNP databases are often species-limited or based on outdated data. Therefore, we updated our miRNASNP database to version 4 by updating data, expanding the species from Homo sapiens to 17 species, and introducing several new features. In miRNASNP-v4, 82 580 SNPs in miRNAs and 24 836 179 SNPs in 3'UTRs of genes across 17 species were identified and their potential effects on miRNA secondary structure and target binding were characterized. In addition, compared to the last release, miRNASNP-v4 includes the following improvements: (i) gene enrichment analysis for gained or lost miRNA target genes; (ii) identification of miRNA-related SNPs associated with drug response and immune infiltration in human cancers; (iii) inclusion of experimentally supported immune-related miRNAs and (iv) online prediction tools for 17 animal species.

36917599,AFTM: a database of transmembrane regions in the human proteome predicted by AlphaFold.,"Transmembrane proteins (TMPs), with diverse cellular functions, are difficult targets for structural determination. Predictions of TMPs and the locations of transmembrane segments using computational methods could be unreliable due to the potential for false positives and false negatives and show inconsistencies across different programs. Recent advances in protein structure prediction methods have made it possible to identify TMPs and their membrane-spanning regions using high-quality structural models. We developed the AlphaFold Transmembrane proteins (AFTM) database of candidate human TMPs by identifying transmembrane regions in AlphaFold structural models of human proteins and their domains using the positioning of proteins in membranes, version 3 program, followed by automatic corrections inspired by manual analysis of the results. We compared our results to annotations from the UniProt database and the Human Transmembrane Proteome (HTP) database. While AFTM did not identify transmembrane regions in some single-pass TMPs, it identified more transmembrane regions for multipass TMPs than UniProt and HTP. AFTM also showed more consistent results with experimental structures, as benchmarked against the Protein Data Bank Transmembrane proteins (PDBTM) database. In addition, some proteins previously annotated as TMPs were suggested to be non-TMPs by AFTM. We report the results of AFTM together with those of UniProt, HTP, TmAlphaFold, PDBTM and Membranome in the online AFTM database compiled as a comprehensive resource of candidate human TMPs with structural models.

36321651,RBP Image Database: A resource for the systematic characterization of the subcellular distribution properties of human RNA binding proteins.,"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are central regulators of gene expression implicated in all facets of RNA metabolism. As such, they play key roles in cellular physiology and disease etiology. Since different steps of post-transcriptional gene expression tend to occur in specific regions of the cell, including nuclear or cytoplasmic locations, defining the subcellular distribution properties of RBPs is an important step in assessing their potential functions. Here, we present the RBP Image Database, a resource that details the subcellular localization features of 301 RBPs in the human HepG2 and HeLa cell lines, based on the results of systematic immuno-fluorescence studies conducted using a highly validated collection of RBP antibodies and a panel of 12 markers for specific organelles and subcellular structures.

Accurately predicting liver toxicity is crucial but is hindered by scattered information sources, a lack of curation standards, and the heterogeneity of data perspectives. To address these challenges, we developed the HepatoToxicity Portal (HTP), which integrates an expert-curated knowledgebase (HTP-KB) and a state-of-the-art machine learning model for toxicity prediction (HTP-Pred). The HTP-KB consolidates hepatotoxicity data from nine major databases, carefully reviewed by hepatotoxicity experts and categorized into three levels: in vitro, in vivo, and clinical, using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. The knowledgebase includes information on 8,306 chemicals. This curated dataset was used to build a hepatotoxicity prediction module by fine-tuning a GNN-based foundation model, which was pre-trained with approximately 10 million chemicals in the PubChem database. Our model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.761, surpassing existing methods for hepatotoxicity prediction.

36515985,"The injured sciatic nerve atlas (iSNAT), insights into the cellular and molecular basis of neural tissue degeneration and regeneration.","Upon trauma, the adult murine peripheral nervous system (PNS) displays a remarkable degree of spontaneous anatomical and functional regeneration. To explore extrinsic mechanisms of neural repair, we carried out single-cell analysis of naïve mouse sciatic nerve, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and crushed sciatic nerves at 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days following injury. During the first week, monocytes and macrophages (Mo/Mac) rapidly accumulate in the injured nerve and undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming. Proinflammatory Mo/Mac with a high glycolytic flux dominate the early injury response and rapidly give way to inflammation resolving Mac, programmed toward oxidative phosphorylation. Nerve crush injury causes partial leakiness of the blood-nerve barrier, proliferation of endoneurial and perineurial stromal cells, and entry of opsonizing serum proteins. Micro-dissection of the nerve injury site and distal nerve, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing, identified distinct immune compartments, triggered by mechanical nerve wounding and Wallerian degeneration, respectively. This finding was independently confirmed with <i>Sarm1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, in which Wallerian degeneration is greatly delayed. Experiments with chimeric mice showed that wildtype immune cells readily enter the injury site in <i>Sarm1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, but are sparse in the distal nerve, except for Mo. We used CellChat to explore intercellular communications in the naïve and injured PNS and report on hundreds of ligand-receptor interactions. Our longitudinal analysis represents a new resource for neural tissue regeneration, reveals location- specific immune microenvironments, and reports on large intercellular communication networks.

34991446,ASAP 2: a pipeline and web server to analyze marker gene amplicon sequencing data automatically and consistently.,"<h4>Background</h4>Amplicon sequencing of marker genes such as 16S rDNA have been widely used to survey and characterize microbial community. However, the complex data analyses have required many interfering manual steps often leading to inconsistencies in results.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we have developed a pipeline, amplicon sequence analysis pipeline 2 (ASAP 2), to automate and glide through the processes without the usual manual inspections and user's interference, for instance, in the detection of barcode orientation, selection of high-quality region of reads, and determination of resampling depth and many more. The pipeline integrates all the analytical processes such as importing data, demultiplexing, summarizing read profiles, trimming quality, denoising, removing chimeric sequences and making the feature table among others. The pipeline accepts multiple file formats as input including multiplexed or demultiplexed, paired-end or single-end, barcode inside or outside and raw or intermediate data (e.g. feature table). The outputs include taxonomic classification, alpha/beta diversity, community composition, ordination analysis and statistical tests. ASAP 2 supports merging multiple sequencing runs which helps integrate and compare data from different sources (public databases and collaborators).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our pipeline minimizes hands-on interference and runs amplicon sequence variant (ASV)-based amplicon sequencing analysis automatically and consistently.

35230424,"DSDBASE 2.0: updated version of DiSulphide dataBASE, a database on disulphide bonds in proteins.","Disulphide bonds are stabilizing crosslinks in proteins and serve to enhance their thermal stability. In proteins that are small and rich in disulphide bonds, they could be the major determining factor for the choice of conformational state since their constraints on appropriate backbone conformation can be substantial. Such crosslinks and their positional conservation could itself enable protein family and functional association. Despite the importance of the field, there is no comprehensive database on disulphide crosslinks that is available to the public. Herein we provide information on disulphides in DSDBASE2.0, an updated and significantly expanded database that is freely available, fully annotated and manually curated database on native and modelled disulphides. The web interface also provides several useful computational tools that have been specifically developed for proteins containing disulphide crosslinks. The modelling of disulphide crosslinks is performed using stereochemical criteria, coded within our Modelling of Disulphides in Proteins (MODIP) algorithm. The inclusion of modelled disulphides potentially enhances the loop database substantially, thereby permitting the recognition of compatible polypeptide segments that could serve as templates for immediate modelling. The DSDBASE2.0 database has been updated to include 153,944 PDB entries, 216,096 native and 20,153,850 modelled disulphide bond segments from PDB January 2021 release. The current database also provides a resource to user-friendly search for multiple disulphide bond containing loops, along with annotation of their function using GO and subcellular localization of the query. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain the three-dimensional models of disulphide-rich small proteins using an independent algorithm, RANMOD, that generates and examines random, but allowed backbone conformations of the polypeptide. DSDBASE2.0 still remains the largest open-access repository that organizes all disulphide bonds of proteins on a single platform.

39788736,rRFtargetDB: a database of Ago1-mediated targets of ribosomal RNA fragments.,"rRNA-derived fragments (rRFs) are a class of emerging posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression likely binding to the transcripts of target genes. However, the lack of knowledge about such targets hinders our understanding of rRF functions or binding mechanisms. The paucity of resources supporting the identification of the targets of rRFs creates a bottleneck in the fast-developing field. We have previously analyzed chimeric reads in cross-linked Argonaute1-RNA complexes to help infer the guide-target pairs and binding mechanisms of multiple rRFs based on experimental data in human HEK293 cells. To efficiently disseminate these results to the research community, we designed a web-based database rRFtargetDB that preserves most of the experimental results after the removal of noise and has a user-friendly interface with flexible query options and filters allowing users to obtain comprehensive information on rRFs (or targets) of interest. rRFtargetDB is populated by ∼163,000 experimentally determined unique rRF-mRNA pairs (∼60,000 supported by ≥2 reads). Almost 30,000 rRF isoforms produced >385,000 (>156,000 with ≥2 reads) chimeras with all types of RNA targets (mRNAs and noncoding RNAs). Further analyses suggested hypothetical modes of interactions, supported by secondary structures of potential guide-target hybrids and binding motifs, essential for understanding the targeting mechanisms of rRFs. All these results (ranging from the weakest to the strongest experimental support) are presented in rRFtargetDB, whose goal is to provide a resource for building users' hypotheses on the potential roles of rRFs for experimental validation. Further, we illustrate the value/application of the database in several examples.rRFtargetDB is freely accessible at https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tardb.",True,False,4.5,,rftargetdb,,16.9791392,ok,,rrftargetdb | examples.rrftargetdb,,v2,0.9791392,rRFtargetDB,True,6.0,False,False,https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tardb,https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tardb,True,...eral examples.rRFtargetDB is freely accessible at https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tardb.,1
37924118,Annotation of cell types (ACT): a convenient web server for cell type annotation.,"<h4>Background</h4>The advancement of single-cell sequencing has progressed our ability to solve biological questions. Cell type annotation is of vital importance to this process, allowing for the analysis and interpretation of enormous single-cell datasets. At present, however, manual cell annotation which is the predominant approach remains limited by both speed and the requirement of expert knowledge.<h4>Methods</h4>To address these challenges, we constructed a hierarchically organized marker map through manually curating over 26,000 cell marker entries from about 7000 publications. We then developed WISE, a weighted and integrated gene set enrichment method, to integrate the prevalence of canonical markers and ordered differentially expressed genes of specific cell types in the marker map. Benchmarking analysis suggested that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods.<h4>Results</h4>By integrating the marker map and WISE, we developed a user-friendly and convenient web server, ACT ( http://xteam.xbio.top/ACT/ or http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/ACT/ ), which only takes a simple list of upregulated genes as input and provides interactive hierarchy maps, together with well-designed charts and statistical information, to accelerate the assignment of cell identities and made the results comparable to expert manual annotation. Besides, a pan-tissue marker map was constructed to assist in cell assignments in less-studied tissues. Applying ACT to three case studies showed that all cell clusters were quickly and accurately annotated, and multi-level and more refined cell types were identified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a knowledge-based resource and a corresponding method, together with an intuitive graphical web interface, for cell type annotation. We believe that ACT, emerging as a powerful tool for cell type annotation, would be widely used in single-cell research and considerably accelerate the process of cell type identification.",True,False,4.5,,,act,16.9785426,ok,,annotation of cell types,,v2,0.9785426,Annotation of cell types,True,5.0,False,False,http://xteam.xbio.top/ACT/ | http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/ACT/,http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/ACT/,True,"...t web server, ACT ( http://xteam.xbio.top/ACT/ or http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/ACT/ ), which only takes a simple list of upregulated...",1
35164668,D3PM: a comprehensive database for protein motions ranging from residue to domain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Knowledge of protein motions is significant to understand its functions. While currently available databases for protein motions are mostly focused on overall domain motions, little attention is paid on local residue motions. Albeit with relatively small scale, the local residue motions, especially those residues in binding pockets, may play crucial roles in protein functioning and ligands binding.<h4>Results</h4>A comprehensive protein motion database, namely D3PM, was constructed in this study to facilitate the analysis of protein motions. The protein motions in the D3PM range from overall structural changes of macromolecule to local flip motions of binding pocket residues. Currently, the D3PM has collected 7679 proteins with overall motions and 3513 proteins with pocket residue motions. The motion patterns are classified into 4 types of overall structural changes and 5 types of pocket residue motions. Impressively, we found that less than 15% of protein pairs have obvious overall conformational adaptations induced by ligand binding, while more than 50% of protein pairs have significant structural changes in ligand binding sites, indicating that ligand-induced conformational changes are drastic and mainly confined around ligand binding sites. Based on the residue preference in binding pocket, we classified amino acids into ""pocketphilic"" and ""pocketphobic"" residues, which should be helpful for pocket prediction and drug design.<h4>Conclusion</h4>D3PM is a comprehensive database about protein motions ranging from residue to domain, which should be useful for exploring diverse protein motions and for understanding protein function and drug design.

Chemical probing methods coupled with high-throughput sequencing have significantly accelerated the mapping of RNA structures, and increasingly large datasets of transcriptome-wide RNA chemical probing data are becoming available. Analogously to what has been done for decades in the protein world, this RNA structural information can be leveraged to aid the discovery of structural similarity to a known RNA (or RNA family), which, in turn, can inform about the function of transcripts. We have previously developed SHAPEwarp, a sequence-agnostic method for the search of structurally homologous RNA segments in a database of reactivity profiles derived from chemical probing experiments.

39066515,"CO-19 PDB 2.0: A Comprehensive COVID-19 Database with Global Auto-Alerts, Statistical Analysis, and Cancer Correlations.","Biological databases serve as critical basics for modern research, and amid the dynamic landscape of biology, the COVID-19 database has emerged as an indispensable resource. The global outbreak of Covid-19, commencing in December 2019, necessitates comprehensive databases to unravel the intricate connections between this novel virus and cancer. Despite existing databases, a crucial need persists for a centralized and accessible method to acquire precise information within the research community. The main aim of the work is to develop a database which has all the COVID-19-related data available in just one click with auto global notifications. This gap is addressed by the meticulously designed COVID-19 Pandemic Database (CO-19 PDB 2.0), positioned as a comprehensive resource for researchers navigating the complexities of COVID-19 and cancer. Between December 2019 and June 2024, the CO-19 PDB 2.0 systematically collected and organized 120 datasets into six distinct categories, each catering to specific functionalities. These categories encompass a chemical structure database, a digital image database, a visualization tool database, a genomic database, a social science database, and a literature database. Functionalities range from image analysis and gene sequence information to data visualization and updates on environmental events. CO-19 PDB 2.0 has the option to choose either the search page for the database or the autonotification page, providing a seamless retrieval of information. The dedicated page introduces six predefined charts, providing insights into crucial criteria such as the number of cases and deaths', country-wise distribution, 'new cases and recovery', and rates of death and recovery. The global impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients has led to extensive collaboration among research institutions, producing numerous articles and computational studies published in international journals. A key feature of this initiative is auto daily notifications for standardized information updates. Users can easily navigate based on different categories or use a direct search option. The study offers up-to-date COVID-19 datasets and global statistics on COVID-19 and cancer, highlighting the top 10 cancers diagnosed in the USA in 2022.

We conducted nearly 1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) ε4/ε4, and TREM2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400 cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in AD.<h4>Results</h4>All results are integrated into TACA (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive visualization tools for AD.<h4>Discussion</h4>We envision that TACA will be a highly valuable resource for both basic and translational research in AD, as it provides abundant information for AD pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for drug discovery.<h4>Highlights</h4>We compiled an Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain cell atlas consisting of more than 1.1 million cells/nuclei transcriptomes from 26 data sets, covering major brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and cell types (e.g., neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia).We conducted over 1400 differential expression (DE) comparisons to identify cell type-specific gene expression alterations. Major comparison types are (1) AD versus healthy control; (2) sex-specific DE, (3) genotype-driven DE (i.e., apolipoprotein E [<i>APOE</i>] ε4/ε4 vs <i>APOE</i> ε3/ε3; TREM2<sup>R47H</sup> vs common variants) analysis; and (4) others.

36412325,Acinetobase: the comprehensive database and repository of Acinetobacter strains.,"Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most problematic nosocomial pathogens that can efficiently thrive within hospital settings, mainly due to resistances toward antibiotics, desiccation, disinfectants, human serum and oxidative stress. Recently, increased resistance against last-resort antibiotics earns this bacterium the highest priority concern classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. An obvious hallmark of this bacterium is the high heterogeneity observed among A. baumannii isolates, with a limited core genome. This feature complexifies the study of A. baumannii bacteria as an entity, subsequently reflected in a diversity of phenotypes of not only antimicrobial and environmental resistance but also virulence. A high degree of genome plasticity, along with the use of a limited subset of established strains, can lead to strain-specific observations, decreasing the global understanding of this pathogenic agent. Phenotypic variability of A. baumannii strains is easily observable such as with the macrocolony morphologies, in vitro and in vivo virulence, natural competence level, production of different capsular polysaccharide structures and cellular densities. Some strains encode an extensive amount of virulence factors, while others, including the established strains, lack several key ones. The lack/excess of genes or specific physiological processes might interfere with in vivo and in vitro experiments, thus providing a limited impact on the global understanding of Acinetobacter bacteria. As an answer to the high heterogeneity among A. baumannii strains, we propose a first comprehensive database that includes the bacterial strains and the associated phenotypic and genetic data. This new repository, freely accessible to the entire scientific community, allows selecting the best bacterial isolate(s) related to any biological question, using an efficient and fast exchange platform.

Plant metabolites play crucial roles in all aspects of plant biology, like growth, development, stress responses, etc. However, the lack of a reference metabolome for plants, and paucity of high-quality standard compound spectral libraries and related analytical tools, have hindered the discovery and functional study of phytochemicals in plants. Here, by leveraging an advanced LC-MS platform, we generated untargeted mass spectral data from >150 plant species collected across the five major phyla. Using a self-developed computation protocol, we constructed reference metabolome for 153 plant species. A 'Reference Metabolome Database for Plants' (RefMetaPlant) was built to encompass the reference metabolome, integrated standard compound mass spectral libraries for annotation, and related query and analytical tools like 'LC-MS/MS Query', 'RefMetaBlast' and 'CompoundLibBlast' for searches and profiling of plant metabolome and metabolite identification.

It is widely appreciated that spatiotemporal protein O-GlcNAcylation regulates a plethora of biological processes. High-throughput analytical techniques, particularly site-specific O-GlcNAc proteomics, have tremendously advanced the profiling of O-GlcNAc proteomes. Recently we established O-GlcNAcAtlas, a highly curated database of O-GlcNAc proteins/peptides/sites from experiments reported in the past forty years. However, a resource for O-GlcNAcylation quantification information is not available yet. Herein, we provide an updated database O-GlcNAcAtlas 4.0 by incorporating information of O-GlcNAcylation quantification.

38204359,piOxi database: a web resource of germline and somatic tissue piRNAs identified by chemical oxidation.,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that are highly expressed and extensively studied from the germline. piRNAs associate with PIWI proteins to maintain DNA methylation for transposon silencing and transcriptional gene regulation for genomic stability. Mature germline piRNAs have distinct characteristics including a 24- to 32-nucleotide length and a 2'-O-methylation signature at the 3' end. Although recent studies have identified piRNAs in somatic tissues, they remain poorly characterized. For example, we recently demonstrated notable expression of piRNA in the murine soma, and while overall expression was lower than that of the germline, unique characteristics suggested tissue-specific functions of this class. While currently available databases commonly use length and association with PIWI proteins to identify piRNA, few have included a chemical oxidation method that detects piRNA based on its 3' modification. This method leads to reproducible and rigorous data processing when coupled with next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Here, we introduce piOxi DB, a user-friendly web resource that provides a comprehensive analysis of piRNA, generated exclusively through sodium periodate treatment of small RNA.

However, the available database for integration of RNA editing in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic malignancies is still lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of 29 leukemia patients and 19 healthy donors from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and RNA-seq data of 12 mouse hematopoietic cell populations obtained from our previous research were also used. We performed sequence alignment, identified RNA editing sites, and obtained characteristic editing sites related to normal hematopoietic development and abnormal editing sites associated with hematologic diseases.<h4>Results</h4>We established a new database, ""REDH"", represents RNA editome in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancy. REDH is a curated database of associations between RNA editome and hematopoiesis. REDH integrates 30,796 editing sites from 12 murine adult hematopoietic cell populations and systematically characterizes more than 400,000 edited events in malignant hematopoietic samples from 48 cohorts (human). Through the Differentiation, Disease, Enrichment, and knowledge modules, each A-to-I editing site is systematically integrated, including its distribution throughout the genome, its clinical information (human sample), and functional editing sites under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, REDH compares the similarities and differences of editing sites between different hematologic malignancies and healthy control.<h4>Conclusions</h4>REDH is accessible at http://www.redhdatabase.com/ . This user-friendly database would aid in understanding the mechanisms of RNA editing in hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies.

35025997,LLPSDB v2.0: an updated database of proteins undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Emerging evidences have suggested that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins plays a vital role both in a wide range of biological processes and in related diseases. Whether a protein undergoes phase separation not only is determined by the chemical and physical properties of biomolecule themselves, but also is regulated by environmental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, pH, as well as volume excluded by other macromolecules. A web accessible database LLPSDB was developed recently by our group, in which all the proteins involved in LLPS in vitro as well as corresponding experimental conditions were curated comprehensively from published literatures. With the rapid increase of investigations in biomolecular LLPS and growing popularity of LLPSDB, we updated the database, and developed a new version LLPSDB v2.0. In comparison of the previously released version, more than double contents of data are curated, and a new class 'Ambiguous system' is added. In addition, the web interface is improved, such as that users can search the database by selecting option 'phase separation status' alone or combined with other options. We anticipate that this updated database will serve as a more comprehensive and helpful resource for users.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>LLPSDB v2.0 is freely available at: http://bio-comp.org.cn/llpsdbv2.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,6.0,,,lpsdb,16.94782484,ok,,,llpsdb,v2,0.94782484,LLPSDB,True,6.0,False,False,http://bio-comp.org.cn/llpsdbv2,http://bio-comp.org.cn/llpsdbv2,True,...mentation</h4>LLPSDB v2.0 is freely available at: http://bio-comp.org.cn/llpsdbv2.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
39163546,GMMID: genetically modified mice information database.,"Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are vital for elucidating gene function and disease mechanisms. An overwhelming number of GEMM lines have been generated, but endeavors to collect and organize the information of these GEMMs are seriously lagging behind. Only a few databases are developed for the information of current GEMMs, and these databases lack biological descriptions of allele compositions, which poses a challenge for nonexperts in mouse genetics to interpret the genetic information of these mice. Moreover, these databases usually do not provide information on human diseases related to the GEMM, which hinders the dissemination of the insights the GEMM provides as a human disease model. To address these issues, we developed an algorithm to annotate all the allele compositions that have been reported with Python programming and have developed the genetically modified mice information database (GMMID; http://www.gmmid.cn), a user-friendly database that integrates information on GEMMs and related diseases from various databases, including National Center for Biotechnology Information, Mouse Genome Informatics, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, and Jax lab. GMMID provides comprehensive genetic information on >70 055 alleles, 65 520 allele compositions, and ∼4000 diseases, along with biologically meaningful descriptions of alleles and allele combinations. Furthermore, it provides spatiotemporal visualization of anatomical tissues mentioned in these descriptions, shown alongside the allele compositions. Compared to existing mouse databases, GMMID considers the needs of researchers across different disciplines and presents obscure genetic information in an intuitive and easy-to-understand format. It facilitates users in obtaining complete genetic information more efficiently, making it an essential resource for cross-disciplinary researchers.

39237205,CAPRI-Q: The CAPRI resource evaluating the quality of predicted structures of protein complexes.,"Protein interactions are essential for cellular processes. In recent years there has been significant progress in computational prediction of 3D structures of individual protein chains, with the best-performing algorithms reaching sub-Ångström accuracy. These techniques are now finding their way into the prediction of protein interactions, adding to the existing modeling approaches. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions (CAPRI) has been a catalyst for the development of procedures for the structural modeling of protein assemblies by organizing blind prediction experiments. The predicted structures are assessed against unpublished experimentally determined structures using a set of metrics with proven robustness that have been established in the CAPRI community. In addition, several advanced benchmarking databases provide targets against which users can test docking and assembly modeling software. These include the Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark, the CAPRI Scoreset, and the Dockground database, all developed by members of the CAPRI community. Here we present CAPRI-Q, a stand-alone model quality assessment tool, which can be freely downloaded or used via a publicly available web server. This tool applies the CAPRI metrics to assess the quality of query structures against given target structures, along with other popular quality metrics such as DockQ, TM-score and l-DDT, and classifies the models according to the CAPRI model quality criteria. The tool can handle a variety of protein complex types including those involving peptides, nucleic acids, and oligosaccharides.

39905665,DHARANI: A 3D Developing Human-Brain Atlas Resource to Advance Neuroscience Internationally Integrated Multimodal Imaging and High-Resolution Histology of the Second Trimester.,"We introduce DHARANI, the first online platform with three-dimensional (3D) histological reconstructions of the developing human brain from 14 to 24 gestational weeks (GW) across the five fetal brains. DHARANI features 5132 Nissl, hematoxylin and eosin stained, 20 µm coronal and sagittal sections, postmortem MRI, and a neuroanatomical atlas with 466 annotated sections covering ∼500 brain structures. It is accessible online at https://brainportal.humanbrain.in/publicview/index.html. The 3D reconstruction enables a volumetric view of the fetal brain, allowing visualization in all three planes akin to MRI, previously unachievable with histological datasets from the fetal brain. This allowed qualitative assessment of the growth of brain regions and layers throughout the second trimester. ""DHARANI"" documents the initiation of sulci, with the lateral fissure, calcarine, parieto-occipital, and cingulate sulci, at 14 GW. The central and postcentral sulci appear by 24 GW; however, cytoarchitectonic boundaries become visible before sulcal patterns. Cortical plate (CP) lamination begins at 24 GW in the parietal and occipital cortices. The frontal cortex lacks lamination at 24 GW, although putative Betz cells are already visible and show early patterning in the intermediate zone. The cell-sparse layer between the CP and subplate, containing late migratory neurons, begins in the orbital cortex at 14 GW and reaches the frontal cortex by 17 GW. The appearance of the honeycomb pattern in the occipital and parietal cortex occurs after 14 GW.

39380205,Nphos: Database and Predictor of Protein N-phosphorylation.,"Protein N-phosphorylation is widely present in nature and participates in various biological processes. However, current knowledge on N-phosphorylation is extremely limited compared to that on O-phosphorylation. In this study, we collected 11,710 experimentally verified N-phosphosites of 7344 proteins from 39 species and subsequently constructed the database Nphos to share up-to-date information on protein N-phosphorylation. Upon these substantial data, we characterized the sequential and structural features of protein N-phosphorylation. Moreover, after comparing hundreds of learning models, we chose and optimized gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models to predict three types of human N-phosphorylation, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 90.56%, 91.24%, and 92.01% for pHis, pLys, and pArg, respectively. Meanwhile, we discovered 488,825 distinct N-phosphosites in the human proteome. The models were also deployed in Nphos for interactive N-phosphosite prediction. In summary, this work provides new insights and points for both flexible and focused investigations of N-phosphorylation. It will also facilitate a deeper and more systematic understanding of protein N-phosphorylation modification by providing a data and technical foundation.

39673440,MOLGENIS Armadillo: a lightweight server for federated analysis using DataSHIELD.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Extensive human health data from cohort studies, national registries, and biobanks can reveal lifecourse risk factors impacting health. Combining these sources offers increased statistical power, rare outcome detection, replication of findings, and extended study periods. Traditionally, this required data transfer to a central location or separate partner analyses with pooled summary statistics, posing ethical, legal, and time constraints. Federated analysis-which involves remote data analysis without sharing individual-level data-is a promising alternative. One promising solution is DataSHIELD (https://datashield.org/), an open-source R based implementation. To enable federated analysis, data owners need a user-friendly way to install the federated infrastructure and manage users and data. Here, we present MOLGENIS Armadillo: a lightweight server for federated analysis solutions such as DataSHIELD.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Armadillo is implemented as a collection of three packages freely available under the open source licence LGPLv3: two R packages downloadable from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) (""MolgenisArmadillo"" and ""DSMolgenisArmdillo"") and one Java application (""ArmadilloService"") as jar and docker images via Github (https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-service-armadillo).",True,False,5.0,,rmadillo,,16.94493157,ok,,datashield | comprehensive r archive network | molgenisarmadillo | armadilloservice | https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-service-armadillo | molgenis armadillo,molgenis,v2,0.94493157,MOLGENIS Armadillo,True,5.0,False,False,https://datashield.org/,https://datashield.org/,True,"...lternative.

36806692,MGnify Genomes: A Resource for Biome-specific Microbial Genome Catalogues.,"An increasingly common output arising from the analysis of shotgun metagenomic datasets is the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), with tens of thousands of MAGs now described in the literature. However, the discovery and comparison of these MAG collections is hampered by the lack of uniformity in their generation, annotation and storage. To address this, we have developed MGnify Genomes, a growing collection of biome-specific non-redundant microbial genome catalogues generated using MAGs and publicly available isolate genomes. Genomes within a biome-specific catalogue are organised into species clusters. For species that contain multiple conspecific genomes, the highest quality genome is selected as the representative, always prioritising an isolate genome over a MAG. The species representative sequences and annotations can be visualised on the MGnify website and the full catalogue and associated analysis outputs can be downloaded from MGnify servers. A suite of online search tools is provided allowing users to compare their own sequences, ranging from a gene to sets of genomes, against the catalogues. Seven biomes are available currently, comprising over 300,000 genomes that represent 11,048 non-redundant species, and include 36 taxonomic classes not currently represented by cultured genomes.

40135505,MUTATE: a human genetic atlas of multiorgan artificial intelligence endophenotypes using genome-wide association summary statistics.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into imaging genetics to provide intermediate phenotypes (i.e. endophenotypes) that bridge the genetics and clinical manifestations of human disease. However, the genetic architecture of these AI endophenotypes remains largely unexplored in the context of human multiorgan system diseases. Using publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UK Biobank (UKBB), FinnGen, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we comprehensively depicted the genetic architecture of 2024 multiorgan AI endophenotypes (MAEs). We comparatively assessed the single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability, polygenicity, and natural selection signatures of 2024 MAEs using methods commonly used in the field. Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses reveal both within-organ relationships and cross-organ interconnections. Bi-directional causal relationships were established between chronic human diseases and MAEs across multiple organ systems, including Alzheimer's disease for the brain, diabetes for the metabolic system, asthma for the pulmonary system, and hypertension for the cardiovascular system. Finally, we derived polygenic risk scores for the 2024 MAEs for individuals not used to calculate MAEs and returned these to the UKBB. Our findings underscore the promise of the MAEs as new instruments to ameliorate overall human health.

35610055,Dali server: structural unification of protein families.,"Protein structure is key to understanding biological function. Structure comparison deciphers deep phylogenies, providing insight into functional conservation and functional shifts during evolution. Until recently, structural coverage of the protein universe was limited by the cost and labour involved in experimental structure determination. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning revolutionized structural bioinformatics by providing accurate structural models of numerous protein families for which no structural information existed. The Dali server for 3D protein structure comparison is widely used by crystallographers to relate new structures to pre-existing ones. Here, we report two most recent upgrades to the web server: (i) the foldomes of key organisms in the AlphaFold Database (version 1) are searchable by Dali, (ii) structural alignments are annotated with protein families. Using these new features, we discovered a novel functionally diverse subgroup within the WRKY/GCM1 clan. This was accomplished by linking the structurally characterized SWI/SNF and NAM families as well as the structural models of the CG-1 family and uncharacterized proteins to the structure of Gti1/Pac2, a previously known member of the WRKY/GCM1 clan.

36401317,MarineMetagenomeDB: a public repository for curated and standardized metadata for marine metagenomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metagenomics is an expanding field within microbial ecology, microbiology, and related disciplines. The number of metagenomes deposited in major public repositories such as Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and Metagenomic Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) is rising exponentially. However, data mining and interpretation can be challenging due to mis-annotated and misleading metadata entries. In this study, we describe the Marine Metagenome Metadata Database (MarineMetagenomeDB) to help researchers identify marine metagenomes of interest for re-analysis and meta-analysis. To this end, we have manually curated the associated metadata of several thousands of microbial metagenomes currently deposited at SRA and MG-RAST.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 125 terms were curated according to 17 different classes (e.g., biome, material, oceanic zone, geographic feature and oceanographic phenomena). Other standardized features include sample attributes (e.g., salinity, depth), sample location (e.g., latitude, longitude), and sequencing features (e.g., sequencing platform, sequence count). MarineMetagenomeDB version 1.0 contains 11,449 marine metagenomes from SRA and MG-RAST distributed across all oceans and several seas. Most samples were sequenced using Illumina sequencing technology (84.33%). More than 55% of the samples were collected from the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. About 40% of the samples had their biomes assigned as 'ocean'. The 'Quick Search' and 'Advanced Search' tabs allow users to use different filters to select samples of interest dynamically in the web app. The interactive map allows the visualization of samples based on their location on the world map. The web app is also equipped with a novel download tool (on both Windows and Linux operating systems), that allows easy download of raw sequence data of selected samples from their respective repositories. As a use case, we demonstrated how to use the MarineMetagenomeDB web app to select estuarine metagenomes for potential large-scale microbial biogeography studies.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The MarineMetagenomeDB is a powerful resource for non-bioinformaticians to find marine metagenome samples with curated metadata and stimulate meta-studies involving marine microbiomes.

40056431,Pipeline to explore information on genome editing using large language models and genome editing meta-database.,"Genome editing (GE) is widely recognized as an effective and valuable technology in life sciences research. However, certain genes are difficult to edit depending on some factors such as the type of species, sequences, and GE tools. Therefore, confirming the presence or absence of GE practices in previous publications is crucial for the effective designing and establishment of research using GE. Although the Genome Editing Meta-database (GEM: https://bonohu.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/gem/) aims to provide as comprehensive GE information as possible, it does not indicate how each registered gene is involved in GE. In this study, we developed a systematic method for extracting essential GE information using large language models from the information based on GEM and GE-related articles. This approach allows for a systematic and efficient investigation of GE information that cannot be achieved using the current GEM alone. In addition, by converting the extracted GE information into metrics, we propose a potential application of this method to prioritize genes for future research. The extracted GE information and novel GE-related scores are expected to facilitate the efficient selection of target genes for GE and support the design of research using GE.

36503126,iHypoxia: An Integrative Database of Protein Expression Dynamics in Response to Hypoxia in Animals.,"Mammals have evolved mechanisms to sense hypoxia and induce hypoxic responses. Recently, high-throughput techniques have greatly promoted global studies of protein expression changes during hypoxia and the identification of candidate genes associated with hypoxia-adaptive evolution, which have contributed to the understanding of the complex regulatory networks of hypoxia. In this study, we developed an integrated resource for the expression dynamics of proteins in response to hypoxia (iHypoxia), and this database contains 2589 expression events of 1944 proteins identified by low-throughput experiments (LTEs) and 422,553 quantitative expression events of 33,559 proteins identified by high-throughput experiments from five mammals that exhibit a response to hypoxia. Various experimental details, such as the hypoxic experimental conditions, expression patterns, and sample types, were carefully collected and integrated. Furthermore, 8788 candidate genes from diverse species inhabiting low-oxygen environments were also integrated. In addition, we conducted an orthologous search and computationally identified 394,141 proteins that may respond to hypoxia among 48 animals. An enrichment analysis of human proteins identified from LTEs shows that these proteins are enriched in certain drug targets and cancer genes. Annotation of known posttranslational modification (PTM) sites in the proteins identified by LTEs reveals that these proteins undergo extensive PTMs, particularly phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation. iHypoxia provides a convenient and user-friendly method for users to obtain hypoxia-related information of interest.

It is closely linked to the pathophysiological processes in many diseases. Since our publication of the first ferroptosis database in 2020 (FerrDb V1), many new findings have been published. To keep up with the rapid progress in ferroptosis research and to provide timely and high-quality data, here we present the successor, FerrDb V2. It contains 1001 ferroptosis regulators and 143 ferroptosis-disease associations manually curated from 3288 articles. Specifically, there are 621 gene regulators, of which 264 are drivers, 238 are suppressors, 9 are markers, and 110 are unclassified genes; and there are 380 substance regulators, with 201 inducers and 179 inhibitors. Compared to FerrDb V1, curated articles increase by >300%, ferroptosis regulators increase by 175%, and ferroptosis-disease associations increase by 50.5%. Circular RNA and pseudogene are novel regulators in FerrDb V2, and the percentage of non-coding RNA increases from 7.3% to 13.6%.

36266726,CASA: a comprehensive database resource for the COVID-19 Alternative Splicing Atlas.,"<h4>Background</h4>As a key process in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, alternative splicing (AS) plays a crucial role in maintaining the diversity of RNA and protein expression, and mediates the immune response in infectious diseases, especially for the COVID-19. Therefore, urgent data gathering and more research of AS profiles in microbe-infected human cells are needed to improve understanding of COVID-19 and related infectious diseases. Herein, we have created CASA, the COVID-19 Alternative Splicing Atlas to provide a convenient computing platform for studies of AS in COVID-19 and COVID-19-related infectious diseases.<h4>Methods</h4>In CASA, we reanalyzed thousands of RNA-seq datasets generated from 65 different tissues, organoids and cell lines to systematically obtain quantitative data on AS events under different conditions. A total of 262,994 AS events from various infectious diseases with differing severity were detected and visualized in this database. In order to explore the potential function of dynamics AS events, we performed analysis of functional annotations and drug-target interactions affected by AS in each dataset. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which may regulate these dynamic AS events are also provided for users in this database.<h4>Results</h4>CASA displays microbe-induced alterations of the host cell splicing landscape across different virus families and helps users identify condition-specific splicing patterns, as well as their potential regulators.

36257484,Ori-Finder 2022: A Comprehensive Web Server for Prediction and Analysis of Bacterial Replication Origins.,"The replication of DNA is a complex biological process that is essential for life. Bacterial DNA replication is initiated at genomic loci referred to as replication origins (oriCs). Integrating the Z-curve method, DnaA box distribution, and comparative genomic analysis, we developed a web server to predict bacterial oriCs in 2008 called Ori-Finder, which is helpful to clarify the characteristics of bacterial oriCs. The oriCs of hundreds of sequenced bacterial genomes have been annotated in the genome reports using Ori-Finder and the predicted results have been deposited in DoriC, a manually curated database of oriCs. This has facilitated large-scale data mining of functional elements in oriCs and strand-biased analysis. Here, we describe Ori-Finder 2022 with updated prediction framework, interactive visualization module, new analysis module, and user-friendly interface. More species-specific indicator genes and functional elements of oriCs are integrated into the updated framework, which has also been redesigned to predict oriCs in draft genomes. The interactive visualization module displays more genomic information related to oriCs and their functional elements. The analysis module includes regulatory protein annotation, repeat sequence discovery, homologous oriC search, and strand-biased analyses.

38894604,FP-Zernike: An Open-source Structural Database Construction Toolkit for Fast Structure Retrieval.,"The release of AlphaFold2 has sparked a rapid expansion in protein model databases. Efficient protein structure retrieval is crucial for the analysis of structure models, while measuring the similarity between structures is the key challenge in structural retrieval. Although existing structure alignment algorithms can address this challenge, they are often time-consuming. Currently, the state-of-the-art approach involves converting protein structures into three-dimensional (3D) Zernike descriptors and assessing similarity using Euclidean distance. However, the methods for computing 3D Zernike descriptors mainly rely on structural surfaces and are predominantly web-based, thus limiting their application in studying custom datasets. To overcome this limitation, we developed FP-Zernike, a user-friendly toolkit for computing different types of Zernike descriptors based on feature points. Users simply need to enter a single line of command to calculate the Zernike descriptors of all structures in customized datasets. FP-Zernike outperforms the leading method in terms of retrieval accuracy and binary classification accuracy across diverse benchmark datasets. In addition, we showed the application of FP-Zernike in the construction of the descriptor database and the protocol used for the Protein Data Bank (PDB) dataset to facilitate the local deployment of this tool for interested readers. Our demonstration contained 590,685 structures, and at this scale, our system required only 4-9 s to complete a retrieval. The experiments confirmed that it achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy level.

38506570,Development of marine biodiversity database (BISMaL) to enable estimations past habitat conditions for marine life in the northwestern Pacific.,"Global activities involving the collection of marine biodiversity information have provided a large amount of biological observation records that cover various spatiotemporal areas. To predict biological responses or distribution changes in response to environmental changes by using these observation records, it is essential to analyze not only the current marine physicochemical environmental conditions but also the past conditions when the organisms were observed. We developed a new function to estimate the past marine environmental conditions for the observation records in our marine biodiversity database (Biological Information System for Marine Life: BISMaL) and examine whether the database can reliably estimate thermal habitats for both benthic and planktonic marine organisms. For the benthic squat lobster Shinkaia crosnieri, the estimated and observed in situ temperatures were similar to each other. For the planktonic chaetognaths Krohnitta pacifica and K. subtilis, the estimated temperatures showed clear seasonal changes specific to their distribution areas. These results indicated that BISMaL can reliably provide past habitat conditions regardless of planktonic or benthic lifestyles. BISMaL, which provides both biological observations and estimated past environmental conditions through web services, could lower the barrier to data access and use and make data-driven science available not only for data scientists but also for various marine scientists, such as taxonomists, ecologists and field scientists.

However, traditional statistical models and databases are inadequate to interpret these high-dimensional data within a multi-omics framework. To address this limitation, we introduce DriverDBv4, an updated iteration of the DriverDB cancer driver gene database (http://driverdb.bioinfomics.org/). This updated version offers several significant enhancements: (i) an increase in the number of cohorts from 33 to 70, encompassing approximately 24 000 samples; (ii) inclusion of proteomics data, augmenting the existing types of omics data and thus expanding the analytical scope; (iii) implementation of multiple multi-omics algorithms for identification of cancer drivers; (iv) new visualization features designed to succinctly summarize high-context data and redesigned existing sections to accommodate the increased volume of datasets and (v) two new functions in Customized Analysis, specifically designed for multi-omics driver identification and subgroup expression analysis.

38653491,CovEpiAb: a comprehensive database and analysis resource for immune epitopes and antibodies of human coronaviruses.,"Coronaviruses have threatened humans repeatedly, especially COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has posed a substantial threat to global public health. SARS-CoV-2 continuously evolves through random mutation, resulting in a significant decrease in the efficacy of existing vaccines and neutralizing antibody drugs. It is critical to assess immune escape caused by viral mutations and develop broad-spectrum vaccines and neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes. Thus, we constructed CovEpiAb, a comprehensive database and analysis resource of human coronavirus (HCoVs) immune epitopes and antibodies. CovEpiAb contains information on over 60 000 experimentally validated epitopes and over 12 000 antibodies for HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The database is unique in (1) classifying and annotating cross-reactive epitopes from different viruses and variants; (2) providing molecular and experimental interaction profiles of antibodies, including structure-based binding sites and around 70 000 data on binding affinity and neutralizing activity; (3) providing virological characteristics of current and past circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and in vitro activity of various therapeutics; and (4) offering site-level annotations of key functional features, including antibody binding, immunological epitopes, SARS-CoV-2 mutations and conservation across HCoVs.

However, the complex ingredients of TCM and their interactions with the human body make elucidating molecular mechanisms challenging, which greatly hinders the modernization of TCM. In 2016, we developed BATMAN-TCM 1.0, which is an integrated database of TCM ingredient-target protein interaction (TTI) for pharmacology research. Here, to address the growing need for a higher coverage TTI dataset, and using omics data to screen active TCM ingredients or herbs for complex disease treatment, we updated BATMAN-TCM to version 2.0 (http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/batman-tcm/). Using the same protocol as version 1.0, we collected 17 068 known TTIs by manual curation (with a 62.3-fold increase), and predicted ∼2.3 million high-confidence TTIs. In addition, we incorporated three new features into the updated version: (i) it enables simultaneous exploration of the target of TCM ingredient for pharmacology research and TCM ingredients binding to target proteins for drug discovery; (ii) it has significantly expanded TTI coverage; and (iii) the website was redesigned for better user experience and higher speed.

36300631,PROTAC-DB 2.0: an updated database of PROTACs.,"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which harness the ubiquitin-proteasome system to selectively induce targeted protein degradation, represent an emerging therapeutic technology with the potential to modulate traditional undruggable targets. Over the past few years, this technology has moved from academia to industry and more than 10 PROTACs have been advanced into clinical trials. However, designing potent PROTACs with desirable drug-like properties still remains a great challenge. Here, we report an updated online database, PROTAC-DB 2.0, which is a repository of structural and experimental data about PROTACs. In this 2nd release, we expanded the number of PROTACs to 3270, which corresponds to a 96% expansion over the first version. Meanwhile, the numbers of warheads (small molecules targeting the proteins of interest), linkers, and E3 ligands (small molecules recruiting E3 ligases) have increased to over 360, 1500 and 80, respectively. In addition, given the importance and the limited number of the crystal target-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex structures, we provide the predicted ternary complex structures for PROTACs with good degradation capability using our PROTAC-Model method.

36271888,"EV-ADD, a database for EV-associated DNA in human liquid biopsy samples.","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cellular communication both in physiological conditions and in pathologies such as cancer. Emerging evidence has shown that EVs are active carriers of molecular cargo (e.g. protein and nucleic acids) and a powerful source of biomarkers and targets. While recent studies on EV-associated DNA (EV-DNA) in human biofluids have generated a large amount of data, there is currently no database that catalogues information on EV-DNA. To fill this gap, we have manually curated a database of EV-DNA data derived from human biofluids (liquid biopsy) and in-vitro studies, called the Extracellular Vesicle-Associated DNA Database (EV-ADD). This database contains validated experimental details and data extracted from peer-reviewed published literature. It can be easily queried to search for EV isolation methods and characterization, EV-DNA isolation techniques, quality validation, DNA fragment size, volume of starting material, gene names and disease context. Currently, our database contains samples representing 23 diseases, with 13 different types of EV isolation techniques applied on eight different human biofluids (e.g. blood, saliva). In addition, EV-ADD encompasses EV-DNA data both representing the whole genome and specifically including oncogenes, such as KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, MYC, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). An EV-ADD data metric system was also integrated to assign a compliancy score to the MISEV guidelines based on experimental parameters reported in each study. While currently available databases document the presence of proteins, lipids, RNA and metabolites in EVs (e.g. Vesiclepedia, ExoCarta, ExoBCD, EVpedia, and EV-TRACK), to the best of our knowledge, EV-ADD is the first of its kind to compile all available EV-DNA datasets derived from human biofluid samples. We believe that this database provides an important reference resource on EV-DNA-based liquid biopsy research, serving as a learning tool and to showcase the latest developments in the EV-DNA field.

The top-level ortholog table is now constructed from 1,812 genus-level pan-genomes, 6,268 species-level pan-genomes, and 34,079 genomes in total. To support analyses of newly sequenced genomes, MBGD updates MyMBGD functionality, which offers two analysis modes: assignment mode and clustering mode. Assignment mode rapidly classifies genes in the query genomes into existing MBGD ortholog groups, while clustering mode performs de novo clustering of query genomes using the DomClust program. In assignment mode, users can evaluate the presence of genomic functions, as defined in the KEGG Module database, in each query genome using the Genomaple software and compare the results across multiple genomes. To enhance this analysis, we developed a method to subdivide MBGD ortholog groups as needed to improve cross-references to the KEGG Orthology groups. Another notable feature is the phylogenetic profile search interface, which enables users to specify a set of organisms in which orthologs are present or absent (i.e., a phylogenetic profile), and search for ortholog groups with similar phylogenetic profiles. To construct a phylogenetic profile, users can search organisms by specifying phenotype, environment, taxonomy, or a particular ortholog group.

34751399,Priority index: database of genetic targets in immune-mediated disease.,"We describe a comprehensive and unique database 'Priority index' (Pi; http://pi.well.ox.ac.uk) of prioritized genes encoding potential therapeutic targets that encompasses all major immune-mediated diseases. We provide targets at the gene level, each receiving a 5-star rating supported by: genomic evidence arising from disease genome-wide associations and functional immunogenomics, annotation evidence using ontologies restricted to genes with genomic evidence, and network evidence from protein interactions. Target genes often act together in related molecular pathways. The underlying Pi approach is unique in identifying a network of highly rated genes that mediate pathway crosstalk. In the Pi website, disease-centric pages are specially designed to enable the users to browse a complete list of prioritized genes and also a manageable list of nodal genes at the pathway crosstalk level; both switchable by clicks. Moreover, target genes are cross-referenced and supported using additional information, particularly regarding tractability, including druggable pockets viewed in 3D within protein structures. Target genes highly rated across diseases suggest drug repurposing opportunity, while genes in a particular disease reveal disease-specific targeting potential. To facilitate the ease of such utility, cross-disease comparisons involving multiple diseases are also supported.

In the first release (PlantRNA 1.0), tRNA genes from 11 organisms were annotated. In this second version, the annotation was implemented to 51 photosynthetic species covering the whole phylogenetic tree of photosynthetic organisms, from the most basal group of Archeplastida, the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa, to various land plants. tRNA genes from lower photosynthetic organisms such as streptophyte algae or lycophytes as well as extremophile photosynthetic species such as Eutrema parvulum were incorporated in the database. As a whole, about 37 000 tRNA genes were accurately annotated. In the frame of the tRNA genes annotation from the genome of the Rhodophyte Chondrus crispus, non-canonical splicing sites in the D- or T-regions of tRNA molecules were identified and experimentally validated.

37106367,PlaASDB: a comprehensive database of plant alternative splicing events in response to stress.,"<h4>Background</h4>Alternative splicing (AS) is a co-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of plants in response to environmental stress. However, the role of AS in biotic and abiotic stress responses remains largely unknown. To speed up our understanding of plant AS patterns under different stress responses, development of informative and comprehensive plant AS databases is highly demanded.<h4>Description</h4>In this study, we first collected 3,255 RNA-seq data under biotic and abiotic stresses from two important model plants (Arabidopsis and rice). Then, we conducted AS event detection and gene expression analysis, and established a user-friendly plant AS database termed PlaASDB. By using representative samples from this highly integrated database resource, we compared AS patterns between Arabidopsis and rice under abiotic and biotic stresses, and further investigated the corresponding difference between AS and gene expression. Specifically, we found that differentially spliced genes (DSGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEG) share very limited overlapping under all kinds of stresses, suggesting that gene expression regulation and AS seemed to play independent roles in response to stresses. Compared with gene expression, Arabidopsis and rice were more inclined to have conserved AS patterns under stress conditions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PlaASDB is a comprehensive plant-specific AS database that mainly integrates the AS and gene expression data of Arabidopsis and rice in stress response. Through large-scale comparative analyses, the global landscape of AS events in Arabidopsis and rice was observed. We believe that PlaASDB could help researchers understand the regulatory mechanisms of AS in plants under stresses more conveniently.

40293718,PICRUSt2-SC: an update to the reference database used for functional prediction within PICRUSt2.,"<h4>Summary</h4>PICRUSt2 is a bioinformatic tool that predicts microbial functions in amplicon sequencing data using a database of annotated reference genomes. We have constructed an updated database for PICRUSt2 that has substantially increased the number of bacterial (19,493 to 26,868) and archaeal (406 to 1,002) genomes as well as the number of functional annotations present. The previous PICRUSt2 database relied on many timely and computationally intensive manual processes that made it difficult to update. We constructed a new streamlined process to allow regular upgrades to the PICRUSt2 database on an ongoing basis, and used this process to create a new database, PICRUSt2-SC (Sugar-Coated). Additionally, we have shown that this updated database contains genomes that more closely match study sequences from a range of different environments. The genomes contained in the database therefore better represent these environments and this leads to an improvement in the predicted functional annotations obtained from PICRUSt2.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PICRUSt2 source code is freely available at https://github.com/picrust/picrust2 and at https://anaconda.org/bioconda/picrust2.

35799352,HARIBOSS: a curated database of RNA-small molecules structures to aid rational drug design.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA molecules are implicated in numerous fundamental biological processes and many human pathologies, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, muscular diseases and bacterial infections. Modulating the mode of action of disease-implicated RNA molecules can lead to the discovery of new therapeutical agents and even address pathologies linked to 'undruggable' protein targets. This modulation can be achieved by direct targeting of RNA with small molecules. As of today, only a few RNA-targeting small molecules are used clinically. One of the main obstacles that have hampered the development of a rational drug design protocol to target RNA with small molecules is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of RNA-small molecule (RNA-SM) recognition.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Harnessing RIBOnucleic acid-Small molecule Structures (HARIBOSS), a curated collection of RNA-SM structures determined by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy.

39924294,AtSubP-2.0: An integrated web server for the annotation of Arabidopsis proteome subcellular localization using deep learning.,"The organization of subcellular components in a cell is critical for its function and studying cellular processes, protein-protein interactions, identifying potential drug targets, network analysis, and other systems biology mechanisms. Determining protein localization experimentally is time-consuming and expensive. Due to the need for meticulous experimentation, validation, and data analysis, computational methods provide a quick and accurate alternative. Arabidopsis thaliana, a beneficial model organism in plant biology, facilitates experimentation and applies to other plants. Predicting its proteins' subcellular localization can improve our understanding of cellular processes and have applications in crop improvement and biotechnology. We propose AtSubP-2.0, an extension of our previously developed and widely used AtSubP v1.0 tool for annotating the Arabidopsis proteome. For precise protein subcellular localization prediction, AtSubP-2.0 employs a four-phase strategy. The first phase differentiates between single and dual localization with accuracy (97.66% in fivefold training/testing, 98.10% on independent data) and high Matthews correlation coefficient (0.88 training, 0.90 independent). Single localized proteins are classified into 12 locations at the second phase, with accuracy (98.37% in fivefold training/testing, 97.43% on independent data) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.94 training, 0.91 independent). The third phase categorizes dual location proteins into nine classes with accuracy (99.65% in fivefold training/testing, 98.16% on independent data) and Matthews correlation coefficient (0.92 training, 0.87 independent). We also employed a fourth phase that classifies the membrane type proteins predicted in phase I into single-pass and multi-pass membrane with accuracy (98% in fivefold training/testing, 98.55% on independent data) and a high Matthews correlation coefficient (0.95 training, 0.97 independent).

37329484,DSP: database of disease susceptibility genes in plants.,"Host-pathogen interaction is the most crucial factor that evokes the host immune system to fight against pathogens. In contrast to specialized immune cells present in humans and animals, plants have disease resistance (R-) and disease susceptibility (S-) genes. R-genes confer disease resistance and are generally introgressed from wild crop relatives to cultivated crops. S-genes, on the other hand, assist pathogens in establishing contact, displaying counter-defense measures, and spreading the infection. To achieve resistance in a variety of crops, researchers are now focusing on the identification, silencing, editing, or elimination of crucial S-genes. To aid in this field, we created the first curated database of disease susceptibility genes in plants (DSP), with the simple and advanced search tool that allows researchers to restrict the query and mining of specified hits. SSR marker identification and primer designing could be performed with the help of MISA and Primer3 software, respectively.

37620754,GMMAD: a comprehensive database of human gut microbial metabolite associations with diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>The natural products, metabolites, of gut microbes are crucial effect factors on diseases. Comprehensive identification and annotation of relationships among disease, metabolites, and microbes can provide efficient and targeted solutions towards understanding the mechanism of complex disease and development of new markers and drugs.<h4>Results</h4>We developed Gut Microbial Metabolite Association with Disease (GMMAD), a manually curated database of associations among human diseases, gut microbes, and metabolites of gut microbes. Here, this initial release (i) contains 3,836 disease-microbe associations and 879,263 microbe-metabolite associations, which were extracted from literatures and available resources and then experienced our manual curation; (ii) defines an association strength score and a confidence score. With these two scores, GMMAD predicted 220,690 disease-metabolite associations, where the metabolites all belong to the gut microbes. We think that the positive effective (with both scores higher than suggested thresholds) associations will help identify disease marker and understand the pathogenic mechanism from the sense of gut microbes. The negative effective associations would be taken as biomarkers and have the potential as drug candidates. Literature proofs supported our proposal with experimental consistence; (iii) provides a user-friendly web interface that allows users to browse, search, and download information on associations among diseases, metabolites, and microbes.

When enzymatic reactions are disrupted by gene, protein, or metabolite dysfunctions in diseases, it becomes crucial to visualize the resulting perturbed enzymatic reaction-induced multi-omics network. Multi-omics network visualization aids in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the functionality and regulatory mechanisms within biological systems.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we designed PhenoMultiOmics, an enzymatic reaction-based multi-omics web server designed to explore the scope of the multi-omics network across various cancer types. We first curated the PhenoMultiOmics database, which enables the retrieval of cancer-gene-protein-metabolite relationships based on the enzymatic reactions.

Despite the availability of multiple valuable datasets, many functional implications, especially those related to alternative splicing, remain poorly understood. Moreover, neuroscientists working primarily experimentally often lack the bioinformatics expertise required to process alternative splicing data and produce meaningful and interpretable results. Notably, re-analyzing publicly available datasets and integrating them with in-house data can provide substantial novel insights. However, such analyses necessitate developing harmonized data handling and processing pipelines which in turn require considerable computational resources and in-depth bioinformatics expertise.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Cortexa-a comprehensive web portal that incorporates RNA-sequencing datasets from the mouse cerebral cortex (longitudinal or cell-specific) and the hippocampus. Cortexa facilitates understandable visualization of the expression and alternative splicing patterns of individual genes. Our platform provides SplicePCA-a tool that allows users to integrate their alternative splicing dataset and compare it to cell-specific or developmental neocortical splicing patterns.

Numerous factors, including lifestyle, diet, and physical fitness, are known to shape the composition of the human microbiome. However, a significant challenge in elucidating the relationships between these factors and the gut microbiome lies in needing a comprehensive database that integrates diverse human microbiome profiles with extensive sample metadata. To address this issue, we developed an extensive human microbiome database for healthy individuals. This initiative led to the establishment of the NIBN Japan Microbiome Database (NIBN JMD), one of the largest resources of its kind, encompassing up to 1,000 metadata points and more than 2,000 microbiome samples, including data from longitudinal studies.

40504102,Pra-GE-ATLAS: Empowering Pinus radiata stress and breeding research through a multi-omics database.,"In recent decades, research on model organisms has significantly increased our understanding of core biological processes in plant science. However, this focus has created a substantial knowledge bottleneck due to the limited phylogenetic and ecological spectrum covered. Gymnosperms, especially conifers, represent a molecular and ecological diversity hotspot among seed plants. Despite their importance, research on these species is notably underrepresented, primarily due to a slower pace of investigation resulting from a lack of community-based resources and databases. To fill this gap, we developed the P(inus)ra(diata)-G(ene)E(xpression) (Pra-GE)-ATLAS, which consists of several tools and two main modules: transcriptomics and proteomics, presented in this work for the forestry commercial and stress-sensitive species Pinus radiata. We have summarized and centralized all the available information to provide a comprehensive view of the gene expression landscape. To illustrate how applications of the database lead to new biological insights, we have integrated multiple regulatory layers across tissues and stressors. While stress favors the retention of small introns, harmonized alternative splicing analyses reveal that genes with conifers' iconic large introns tend to be under constitutive regulation. Furthermore, the degree of convergence between stressors differed between regulatory layers, with proteomic responses remaining highly distinctive even through intergenerational memory tolerance. Overall, the Pra-GE-ATLAS aims to narrow the distance between angiosperms and gymnosperms resources, deepening our understanding of how characteristic pine features have evolved.

38835776,MONET: a database for prediction of neoantigens derived from microsatellite loci.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microsatellite instability (MSI) secondary to mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is characterized by insertions and deletions (indels) in short DNA sequences across the genome. These indels can generate neoantigens, which are ideal targets for precision immune interception. However, current neoantigen databases lack information on neoantigens arising from coding microsatellites. To address this gap, we introduce The MicrOsatellite Neoantigen Discovery Tool (MONET).<h4>Method</h4>MONET identifies potential mutated tumor-specific neoantigens (neoAgs) by predicting frameshift mutations in coding microsatellite sequences of the human genome. Then MONET annotates these neoAgs with key features such as binding affinity, stability, expression, frequency, and potential pathogenicity using established algorithms, tools, and public databases.

40133792,"Heligeom: A web resource to generate, analyze, and visualize filament architectures based on pairwise association geometries of biological macromolecules.","At the subcellular level, macromolecules self-assemble to form molecular machinery in which the assembly modes play critical roles: the structural integrity of cell walls that allows mechanical growth, the maintenance and repair of the genetic material, membrane flow control, protein chaperoning, and ATP production, to cite just a few examples. As molecular modeling expands its scope to such systems, structural biologists are faced with the difficulty of understanding the structure and dynamics of these supramolecular assemblies. We present Heligeom, a webserver that offers a simple and efficient means for analyzing and constructing oligomeric assemblies based on user-provided structures of two interacting units. The input 3D coordinates may result from structure determination, simulations, docking trials, or deep-learning tools such as AlphaFold. For a given interface, Heligeom outputs the mathematical helical parameters of the corresponding oligomeric form, including axis, pitch, handedness, number of monomers per turn, etc. The server also allows leveraging these parameters to construct oligomers of specified size, visualizing them interactively, and downloading them as PDB files. For subunits (protomers) having multiple interaction geometries, the different interfaces and their global assembly geometry can be visualized and compared. Heligeom thus allows explicitly linking protomer-protomer interfaces to the oligomeric architecture, illuminating possible sources of plasticity in protein filaments such as mutations or thermal, mechanical, or chemical perturbations. Heligeom thus constitutes an intuitive tool to accompany integrative modeling of oligomeric filamentous assemblies. Examples of its application at different structural levels are presented.

Information on ROS-producing, scavenging, and regulatory proteins from various taxonomic kingdoms and organelles, enzyme classes, and diseases was scattered across the literature. Consolidation of all information would facilitate the researchers to understand ROS-related pathology and possible therapeutics. For the first time, we developed a secondary database, ROSBASE1.0, consolidating ROS protein features, taxonomy, diseases, and interactome data. Data sources were PubMed, UniProt, STRING, and Google Scholar databases. Notably, 81.5% of the reported data were experimentally curated. The ROS mechanism was elucidated for 79.2% of entries based on text-mining from the literature. A total of 2494 experimentally annotated entries (UniProt IDs) were curated in the database. Multiple PDB IDs correspond to individual UniProt IDs, resulting higher number of PDB entries (n = 9174). The database reported 2447 genes, 16 cell organelles, 395 organisms, and 218 disease entries (corresponding to 143 proteins) classified into 14 categories. In this database, proteins were classified based on taxonomic kingdoms, enzyme classes, and diseases.

However, they rarely contain information on the genetic operating system of microbial strains.<h4>Results</h4>We established a comprehensive microbial strain database, SynBioStrainFinder, by integrating CRISPR/Cas gene-editing system information with cultivation methods, genome sequence data, and compound-related information. It is presented through three modules, Strain2Gms/PredStrain2Gms, Strain2BasicInfo, and Strain2Compd, which combine to form a rapid strain information query system conveniently curated, integrated, and accessible on a single platform. To date, 1426 CRISPR/Cas gene-editing records of 157 microbial strains have been manually extracted from the literature in the Strain2Gms module. For strains without established CRISPR/Cas systems, the PredStrain2Gms module recommends the system of the most closely related strain as a reference to facilitate the construction of a new CRISPR/Cas gene-editing system. The database contains 139,499 records of strain cultivation and genome sequences, and 773,298 records of strain-related compounds. To facilitate simple and intuitive data application, all microbial strains are also labeled with stars based on the order and availability of strain information.

38312948,HIVseqDB: a portable resource for NGS and sample metadata integration for HIV-1 drug resistance analysis.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a public health threat, with drug resistance being a major concern in HIV treatment. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for identifying low-abundance drug resistance mutations (LA-DRMs) that conventional Sanger sequencing cannot reliably detect. To fully understand the significance of LA-DRMs, it is necessary to integrate NGS data with clinical and demographic data. However, freely available tools for NGS-based HIV-1 drug resistance analysis do not integrate these data. This poses a challenge in interpretation of the impact of LA-DRMs, mainly for resource-limited settings due to the shortage of bioinformatics expertise. To address this challenge, we present HIVseqDB, a portable, secure, and user-friendly resource for integrating NGS data with associated clinical and demographic data for analysis of HIV drug resistance. HIVseqDB currently supports uploading of NGS data and associated sample data, HIV-1 drug resistance data analysis, browsing of uploaded data, and browsing and visualizing of analysis results. Each function of HIVseqDB corresponds to an individual Django application. This ensures efficient incorporation of additional features with minimal effort.

Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the investigation of genomes for desiccation-tolerant plants over the past decade. However, a dedicated and integrated database for these valuable genomic resources has been lacking. Our prolonged interest in VDT plant genomes motivated us to create the ""Drying without Dying"" database, which contains a total of 16 VDT-related plant genomes (including 10 mosses) and incorporates 10 genomes that are closely related to VDT plants. The database features bioinformatic tools, such as blast and homologous cluster search, sequence retrieval, Gene Ontology term and metabolic pathway enrichment statistics, expression profiling, co-expression network extraction, and JBrowser exploration for each genome. To demonstrate its utility, we conducted tailored PFAM family statistical analyses, and we discovered that the drought-responsive ABA transporter AWPM-19 family is significantly tandemly duplicated in all bryophytes but rarely so in tracheophytes. Transcriptomic investigations also revealed that response patterns following desiccation diverged between bryophytes and angiosperms. Combined, the analyses provided genomic and transcriptomic evidence supporting a possible divergence and lineage-specific evolution of VDT in plants.

Moreover, these changes are modulated by various exercise parameters-such as intensity, frequency, mode, and duration-as well as by clinical features like gender, age, and body mass index (BMI), each eliciting distinct biological effects. To assist exercise researchers in understanding these changes from a comprehensive perspective that includes multiple organs, diverse exercise regimens, and a range of clinical features, we developed Exercise Regulated Genes Database (ExerGeneDB), a database of exercise-regulated differential genes.<h4>Methods</h4>ExerGeneDB aggregated publicly available exercise-related sequencing datasets and subjected them to uniform quality control and preprocessing. The data, encompassing a variety of types, were organized into a specialized database of exercise-regulated genes. Notably, ExerGeneDB conducted differential analyses on this collected data, leveraging curated clinical information and accounting for important factors such as gender, age, and BMI.<h4>Results</h4>ExerGeneDB has assembled 1692 samples from rats and mice as well as 4492 human samples. It contains data from various tissues and organs, such as skeletal muscle, blood, adipose tissue, intestine, heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, brain, spinal cord, bone marrow, and bones.

39395186,ELiAH: the atlas of E3 ligases in human tissues for targeted protein degradation with reduced off-target effect.,"The development of therapeutic agents has mainly focused on designing small molecules to modulate target proteins or genes which are conventionally druggable. Therefore, targeted protein degradation (TPD) for undruggable cases has emerged as promising pharmaceutical approach. TPD, often referred PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras), uses a linker to degrade target proteins by hijacking the ubiquitination system. Therefore, unravel the relationship including reversal and co-expression between E3 ligands and other possible target genes in various human tissues is essential to mitigate off-target effects of TPD. Here, we developed the atlas of E3 ligases in human tissues (ELiAH), to prioritize E3 ligase-target gene pairs for TPD. Leveraging over 2900 of RNA-seq profiles consisting of 11 human tissues from the GTEx (genotype-tissue expression) consortium, users of ELiAH can identify tissue-specific genes and E3 ligases (FDR P-value of Mann-Whitney test < .05). ELiAH unravels 933 830 relationships consisting of 614 E3 ligases and 20 924 of expressed genes considering degree of tissue specificity, which are indispensable for ubiquitination based TPD development. In addition, docking properties of those relationships are also modeled using RosettaDock. Therefore, ELiAH presents comprehensive repertoire of E3 ligases for ubiquitination-based TPD drug development avoiding off-target effects.

39198917,"Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb), version 2: trends from three decades of genetic variant impact predictors.","<h4>Background</h4>Variant interpretation is essential for identifying patients' disease-causing genetic variants amongst the millions detected in their genomes. Hundreds of Variant Impact Predictors (VIPs), also known as Variant Effect Predictors (VEPs), have been developed for this purpose, with a variety of methodologies and goals. To facilitate the exploration of available VIP options, we have created the Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb).<h4>Results</h4>The Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb) version 2 presents a collection of VIPs developed over the past three decades, summarizing their characteristics, ClinGen calibrated scores, CAGI assessment results, publication details, access information, and citation patterns. We previously summarized 217 VIPs and their features in VIPdb in 2019. Building upon this foundation, we identified and categorized an additional 190 VIPs, resulting in a total of 407 VIPs in VIPdb version 2. The majority of the VIPs have the capacity to predict the impacts of single nucleotide variants and nonsynonymous variants. More VIPs tailored to predict the impacts of insertions and deletions have been developed since the 2010s. In contrast, relatively few VIPs are dedicated to the prediction of splicing, structural, synonymous, and regulatory variants. The increasing rate of citations to VIPs reflects the ongoing growth in their use, and the evolving trends in citations reveal development in the field and individual methods.<h4>Conclusions</h4>VIPdb version 2 summarizes 407 VIPs and their features, potentially facilitating VIP exploration for various variant interpretation applications. VIPdb is available at  https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb.",True,False,4.5,,,ipdb,16.80551934,ok,,of variant impact predictors | variant impact predictor database | vipdb).<h4 | the variant impact predictor database | clingen | vipdb).<h,vipdb,v2,0.80551934,"Variant Impact Predictor database (VIPdb), version",True,6.0,False,False,https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb,https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb,True,...terpretation applications. VIPdb is available at  https://genomeinterpretation.org/vipdb.,1

38491529,OralExplorer: a web server for exploring the mechanisms of oral inflammatory diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Oral inflammatory diseases are localized infectious diseases primarily caused by oral pathogens with the potential for serious systemic complications. However, publicly available datasets for these diseases are underutilized. To address this issue, a web tool called OralExplorer was developed. This tool integrates the available data and provides comprehensive online bioinformatic analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>Human oral inflammatory disease-related datasets were obtained from the GEO database and normalized using a standardized process. Transcriptome data were then subjected to differential gene expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, correlation analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and visualization. The single-cell sequencing data was visualized as cluster plot, feature plot, and heatmaps. The web platform was primarily built using Shiny. The biomarkers identified in OralExplorer were validated using local clinical samples through qPCR and IHC.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 35 human oral inflammatory disease-related datasets, covering 6 main disease types and 901 samples, were included in the study to identify potential molecular signatures of the mechanisms of oral diseases. OralExplorer consists of 5 main analysis modules (differential gene expression analysis, immune infiltration analysis, correlation analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and single-cell analysis), with multiple visualization options. The platform offers a simple and intuitive interface, high-quality images for visualization, and detailed analysis results tables for easy access by users. Six markers (IL1β, SRGN, CXCR1, FGR, ARHGEF2, and PTAFR) were identified by OralExplorer. qPCR- and IHC-based experimental validation showed significantly higher levels of these genes in the periodontitis group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>OralExplorer is a comprehensive analytical platform for oral inflammatory diseases. It allows users to interactively explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the action and regression of these diseases.

The size of its genome is estimated to be 30 times larger than the human genome and 600 times larger than the genome of the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. To achieve insights into the Gene Space of the genome, which is defined as the space including and surrounding protein-coding regions, a transcriptome project based on PacBio sequencing has recently been conducted. A database resulting from this project contains sequences of 39,092 different open reading frames encoding 32,064 distinct proteins. Based on 'Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs' (BUSCO) analysis, the completeness of the database was estimated to be in the range of 78%. To further develop this database, we performed a transcriptome project of <i>V. album</i> organs harvested in summer and winter based on Illumina sequencing. Data from both sequencing strategies were combined. The new <i>V. album</i> Gene Space database II (VaGs II) contains 90,039 sequences and has a completeness of 93% as revealed by BUSCO analysis. Sequences from other organisms, particularly fungi, which are known to colonize mistletoe leaves, have been removed. To evaluate the quality of the new database, proteome data of a mitochondrial fraction of <i>V. album</i> were re-analyzed. Compared to the original evaluation published five years ago, nearly 1000 additional proteins could be identified in the mitochondrial fraction, providing new insights into the Oxidative Phosphorylation System of <i>V. album</i>.

One advantage of symbolic computation is its potential for qualitative answers to biological questions. Qualitative methods analyze dynamical input systems as formal objects, in contrast to investigating only part of the state space, as is the case with numerical simulation. However, corresponding tools and libraries have a different set of requirements for their input data than their numerical counterparts. A common format used in mathematical modeling of biological processes is Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We illustrate that the use of SBML data in symbolic computation requires significant pre-processing, incorporating external biological and mathematical expertise.

Recent advances in aDNA studies have contributed significantly to increasing our understanding of the natural history of humans. One of the most significant challenges facing archeogenomics is the integration of highly heterogeneous genomic, archeological, and anthropological data and their comprehensive analysis, considering changes that occur in time and space. Only this complex approach can explain the relationship between past populations in the context of migration or cultural development. To address these challenges, we developed a Human AGEs web server. It focuses on creating comprehensive spatiotemporal visualizations of genomic, archeogenomic, and archeological information, which can be provided by the user or loaded from a graph database. The interactive map application at the center of Human AGEs can display multiple layers of data in various forms, such as bubble charts, pie charts, heatmaps, or tag clouds.

The nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is the primary detection method for most pathogens. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid, simple, sensitive, and specific epitome of isothermal NAAT performed using a set of four to six primers. Primer design is a fundamental step in LAMP assays, with several complexities and experimental screening requirements. To address this challenge, an online database is presented here. Its workflow comprises three steps: literature aggregation, data curation, and database and website implementation.<h4>Results</h4>LAMPPrimerBank ( https://lampprimerbank.mathematik.uni-marburg.de ) is a manually curated database dedicated to experimentally validated LAMP primers, their peculiarities of assays, and accompanying literature, with a primary emphasis on respiratory pathogens.

Developing accurate MLSFs for SBVS requires a large and unbiased dataset that includes structurally diverse actives and decoys. Unfortunately, most datasets suffer from hidden biases and data insufficiency. Here, we developed topology-based and conformation-based decoys database (ToCoDDB). The biological targets and active ligands in ToCoDDB were collected from scientific literature and established datasets. The decoys were generated and debiased by using conditional recurrent neural networks and molecular docking. ToCoDDB is presently the largest unbiased database with 2.4 million decoys encompassing 155 targets.

39351064,T-CLEARE: a pilot community-driven tissue clearing protocol repository.,"Selecting and implementing a tissue clearing protocol is challenging. Established more than 100 years ago, tissue clearing is still a rapidly evolving field of research. There are currently many published protocols to choose from, and each performs better or worse across a range of key evaluation factors (e.g., speed, cost, tissue stability, fluorescence quenching). Additionally, tissue clearing protocols are often optimized for specific experimental contexts, and applying an existing protocol to a new problem can require a lengthy period of adaptation by trial and error. Although the primary literature and review articles provide a useful starting point for optimization, there is growing recognition that results can vary dramatically with changes to tissue type or antibody used. To help address this issue, we have developed a novel, freely available repository of tissue clearing protocols named T-CLEARE (Tissue CLEAring protocol REpository; https://doryworkspace.org/doryviz). T-CLEARE incorporates community responses to an open survey designed to capture details not commonly found in the scientific literature, including modifications to published protocols required for specific use cases and instances when tissue clearing protocols did not perform well (negative results).

37399102,RNAenrich: a web server for non-coding RNA enrichment.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the rapid advances of RNA sequencing and microarray technologies in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, functional tools that perform enrichment analysis for ncRNAs are needed. On the one hand, because of the rapidly growing interest in circRNAs, snoRNAs, and piRNAs, it is essential to develop tools for enrichment analysis for these newly emerged ncRNAs. On the other hand, due to the key role of ncRNAs' interacting target in the determination of their function, the interactions between ncRNA and its corresponding target should be fully considered in functional enrichment. Based on the ncRNA-mRNA/protein-function strategy, some tools have been developed to functionally analyze a single type of ncRNA (the majority focuses on miRNA); in addition, some tools adopt predicted target data and lead to only low-confidence results.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, an online tool named RNAenrich was developed to enable the comprehensive and accurate enrichment analysis of ncRNAs. It is unique in (i) realizing the enrichment analysis for various RNA types in humans and mice, such as miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, snoRNA, piRNA, and mRNA; (ii) extending the analysis by introducing millions of experimentally validated data of RNA-target interactions as a built-in database; and (iii) providing a comprehensive interacting network among various ncRNAs and targets to facilitate the mechanistic study of ncRNA function.

The RodentGPOmics Atlas provides: (i) basic information on 2706 rodent species; (ii) chromosome-level visualization of genomes, functional annotations, and genomic comparisons across 121 rodent species; (iii) epidemiological profiles based on 21 852 pathogen sequences reported in rodents and (iv) a few genomic tools for in-depth exploration of rodent multi-omics. This resource aims to advance the development of biomedical models for humans for promoting public health, as well as innovate the genetics, genomics, and molecular evolution in rodents, and offer valuable knowledge on rodent-borne emerging/re-emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.

38843230,Bioinformatics for Dentistry: A secondary database for the genetics of tooth development.,"Genes strictly regulate the development of teeth and their surrounding oral structures. Alteration of gene regulation leads to tooth disorders and developmental anomalies in tooth, oral, and facial regions. With the advancement of gene sequencing technology, genomic data is rapidly increasing. However, the large sets of genomic and proteomic data related to tooth development and dental disorders are currently dispersed in many primary databases and literature, making it difficult for users to navigate, extract, study, or analyze. We have curated the scattered genetic data on tooth development and created a knowledgebase called 'Bioinformatics for Dentistry' (https://dentalbioinformatics.com/). This database compiles genomic and proteomic data on human tooth development and developmental anomalies and organizes them according to their roles in different stages of tooth development. The database is built by systemically curating relevant data from the National Library of Medicine (NCBI) GenBank, OMIM: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, Reactome pathway knowledgebase, Wiki Pathways, and PubMed. The accuracy of the included data was verified from supporting primary literature. Upon data curation and validation, a simple, easy-to-navigate browser interface was created on WordPress version 6.3.2, with PHP version 8.0. The website is hosted in a cloud hosting service to provide fast and reliable data transfer rate. Plugins are used to ensure the browser's compatibility across different devices. Bioinformatics for Dentistry contains four embedded filters for complex and specific searches and free-text search options for quick and simple searching through the datasets. Bioinformatics for Dentistry is made freely available worldwide, with the hope that this knowledgebase will improve our understanding of the complex genetic regulation of tooth development and will open doors to research initiatives and discoveries.

39171722,Mapping autophagy-related membrane contact site proteins and complexes with AutoMCS Navigator.,"In eukaryotic cells, membrane contact sites (MCSs) mediate interactions and communication between organelles by bringing their membranes into close proximity without fusion. These sites play crucial roles in intracellular transport, signal transduction, and the regulation of organelle functions. In a recent study, we compiled data on MCS proteins and complexes from publications to create the MCSdb database. During data compilation, we discovered that many MCSs, their associated proteins, and complexes are highly relevant to macroautophagy/autophagy. To elucidate the role of MCSs in autophagy, we reorganized the autophagy-related MCS proteins and complexes from MCSdb, creating a data map called AutoMCS Navigator. The current version of this map includes 30 complexes and 84 proteins, covering 13 different MCSs and 7 species. Meanwhile, we embedded a dedicated webpage for AutoMCS Navigator on the MCSdb website. This webpage features an orchestrated visual guide that hierarchically displays MCS proteins and complexes involved in autophagy. In summary, our research has developed a user-friendly visual map for querying, browsing, and visualizing detailed information on autophagy-related MCS proteins and complexes. This tool offers researchers easy access to understand autophagy-related MCS structure, assembly, functions, and therapeutic strategies for related diseases.

39602824,Genome-wide identification of SSR markers from coding regions for endangered Argania spinosa L. skeels and construction of SSR database: AsSSRdb.,"Microsatellites [simple sequence repeats (SSRs)] are one of the most widely used sources of genetic markers, particularly prevalent in plants. Despite their importance in various applications, a comprehensive genome-wide identification of coding sequence (CDS)-associated SSR markers in the Argania spinosa L. genome has yet to be conducted. In this study, 66 280 CDSs containing 5351 SSRs within 4535 A. spinosa L. CDSs were identified. Among these, tri-nucleotide motifs (58.96%) were the most common, followed by hexa-nucleotide (15.71%) and di-nucleotide motifs (13.32%). The predominant SSR motif in the tri-nucleotide category was AAG (24.4%), while AG (94.1%) was the most abundant among di-nucleotide repeats. Furthermore, the extracted CDSs containing SSRs were subjected to functional annotation; 3396 CDSs (74.88%) exhibited homology with known proteins, 3341 CDSs (73.7%) were assigned Gene Ontology terms, 1004 CDSs were annotated with Enzyme Commission numbers, and 832 (18.3%) were annotated with KEGG pathways. A total of 3475 primer pairs were designed, out of which 3264 were successfully validated in silico against the A. spinosa L. genome, with 99.6% representing high-resolution markers yielding no more than three products. Additionally, the SSR markers demonstrated a low rate of transferability through in-silico verification in two species within the Sapotaceae family. Furthermore, we developed an online database, the ""Argania spinosa L. SSR database: https://as-fmmdb.shinyapps.io/asssrdb/"" (AsSSRdb) to provide access to the CDS-associated SSRs identified in this study.

35616100,A Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM).,"Despite progress in the development of standards for describing and exchanging scientific information, the lack of easy-to-use standards for mapping between different representations of the same or similar objects in different databases poses a major impediment to data integration and interoperability. Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

38776380,A terpenoids database with the chemical content as a novel agronomic trait.,"Natural products play a pivotal role in drug discovery, and the richness of natural products, albeit significantly influenced by various environmental factors, is predominantly determined by intrinsic genetics of a series of enzymatic reactions and produced as secondary metabolites of organisms. Heretofore, few natural product-related databases take the chemical content into consideration as a prominent property. To gain unique insights into the quantitative diversity of natural products, we have developed the first TerPenoids database embedded with Content information (TPCN) with features such as compound browsing, structural search, scaffold analysis, similarity analysis and data download. This database can be accessed through a web-based computational toolkit available at http://www.tpcn.pro/. By conducting meticulous manual searches and analyzing over 10 000 reference papers, the TPCN database has successfully integrated 6383 terpenoids obtained from 1254 distinct plant species. The database encompasses exhaustive details including isolation parts, comprehensive molecule structures, chemical abstracts service registry number (CAS number) and 7508 content descriptions. The TPCN database accentuates both the qualitative and quantitative dimensions as invaluable phenotypic characteristics of natural products that have undergone genetic evolution. By acting as an indispensable criterion, the TPCN database facilitates the discovery of drug alternatives with high content and the selection of high-yield medicinal plant species or phylogenetic alternatives, thereby fostering sustainable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly drug discovery in pharmaceutical farming.

37605971,The Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances: DEFID2.,"Insect and disease outbreaks in forests are biotic disturbances that can profoundly alter ecosystem dynamics. In many parts of the world, these disturbance regimes are intensifying as the climate changes and shifts the distribution of species and biomes. As a result, key forest ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, regulation of water flows, wood production, protection of soils, and the conservation of biodiversity, could be increasingly compromised. Despite the relevance of these detrimental effects, there are currently no spatially detailed databases that record insect and disease disturbances on forests at the pan-European scale. Here, we present the new Database of European Forest Insect and Disease Disturbances (DEFID2). It comprises over 650,000 harmonized georeferenced records, mapped as polygons or points, of insects and disease disturbances that occurred between 1963 and 2021 in European forests. The records currently span eight different countries and were acquired through diverse methods (e.g., ground surveys, remote sensing techniques). The records in DEFID2 are described by a set of qualitative attributes, including severity and patterns of damage symptoms, agents, host tree species, climate-driven trigger factors, silvicultural practices, and eventual sanitary interventions. They are further complemented with a satellite-based quantitative characterization of the affected forest areas based on Landsat Normalized Burn Ratio time series, and damage metrics derived from them using the LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation algorithm (including onset, duration, magnitude, and rate of the disturbance), and possible interactions with windthrow and wildfire events. The DEFID2 database is a novel resource for many large-scale applications dealing with biotic disturbances. It offers a unique contribution to design networks of experiments, improve our understanding of ecological processes underlying biotic forest disturbances, monitor their dynamics, and enhance their representation in land-climate models. Further data sharing is encouraged to extend and improve the DEFID2 database continuously.

35549894,Galbase: a comprehensive repository for integrating chicken multi-omics data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multi-omics data can provide a stereoscopic view to explore potential causal variations and genes, as well as underlying genetic mechanisms of complex traits. However, for many non-mammalian species, including chickens, these resources are poorly integrated and reused, greatly limiting genetic research and breeding processes of the species.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we constructed Galbase, an easily accessible repository that integrates public chicken multi-omics data from 928 re-sequenced genomes, 429 transcriptomes, 379 epigenomes, 15,275 QTL entries, and 7,526 associations. A total of 21.67 million SNPs, 2.71 million InDels, and 488,583 cis-regulatory elements were included. Galbase allows users to retrieve genomic variations in geographical maps, gene expression profiling in heatmaps, and epigenomic signals in peak patterns. It also provides modules for batch annotation of genes, regions, and loci based on multi-layered omics data. Additionally, a series of convenient tools, including the UCSC Genome Browser, WashU Epigenome Browser, BLAT, BLAST, and LiftOver, were also integrated to facilitate search, visualization, and analysis of sequence features.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Galbase grants new opportunities to research communities to undertake in-depth functional genomic studies on chicken.

37526283,JGI Plant Gene Atlas: an updateable transcriptome resource to improve functional gene descriptions across the plant kingdom.,"Gene functional descriptions offer a crucial line of evidence for candidate genes underlying trait variation. Conversely, plant responses to environmental cues represent important resources to decipher gene function and subsequently provide molecular targets for plant improvement through gene editing. However, biological roles of large proportions of genes across the plant phylogeny are poorly annotated. Here we describe the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Plant Gene Atlas, an updateable data resource consisting of transcript abundance assays spanning 18 diverse species. To integrate across these diverse genotypes, we analyzed expression profiles, built gene clusters that exhibited tissue/condition specific expression, and tested for transcriptional response to environmental queues. We discovered extensive phylogenetically constrained and condition-specific expression profiles for genes without any previously documented functional annotation. Such conserved expression patterns and tightly co-expressed gene clusters let us assign expression derived additional biological information to 64 495 genes with otherwise unknown functions.

37356898,Operon Finder: A Deep Learning-based Web Server for Accurate Prediction of Prokaryotic Operons.,"Operons are groups of consecutive genes that transcribe together under the regulation of a common promoter. They influence protein regulation and various physiological pathways, making their accurate detection desirable. The detection of operons through experimental means is a laborious and financially intensive process. Therefore, human experts predict potential operons utilizing their prior knowledge of the genetic organization and functional correlation of the genes. However, with the rise in the number of completely sequenced genomes, the development of automated algorithms, tools, and web servers is highly preferred over manual detection for operon prediction. Currently available state-of-the-art algorithms use a deep learning-based model to predict if the adjacent genes belong to the same operons in the given genome. However, these require an understanding of programming knowledge and computational skills, making them not-very user friendly. In this study, we developed a user-friendly web service, Operon Finder, for on-the-fly prediction of operons using the deep learning method.

36852842,WASP: the World Archives of Species Perception.,"While human perception can play a role in influencing public support for species conservation, the mechanisms underlying human perception remain poorly understood. Some previous studies on perception have focused on a few specific taxa, which makes the understanding of the public perception of species at large a resource- and time-intensive task. Here, we introduce the World Archives of Species Perception project that consists of an animal survey and a plant survey to construct the first systematic database to study the human perception of the floral and faunal diversity at a global scale. We provide a description of our survey method, species selection, survey implementation and a discussion of the potential uses of our databases in multidisciplinary research. In the animal survey, we cover 1980 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)-evaluated species, representing 25 classes, 192 orders, 1037 families and 1705 genera. In the plant survey, we cover 2000 IUCN-evaluated species, representing 13 classes, 93 orders, 386 families and 1968 genera.

37566336,The Children's Picture Books Lexicon (CPB-LEX): A large-scale lexical database from children's picture books.,"This article presents CPB-LEX, a large-scale database of lexical statistics derived from children's picture books (age range 0-8 years). Such a database is essential for research in psychology, education and computational modelling, where rich details on the vocabulary of early print exposure are required. CPB-LEX was built through an innovative method of computationally extracting lexical information from automatic speech-to-text captions and subtitle tracks generated from social media channels dedicated to reading picture books aloud. It consists of approximately 25,585 types (wordforms) and their frequency norms (raw and Zipf-transformed), a lexicon of bigrams (two-word sequences and their transitional probabilities) and a document-term matrix (which shows the importance of each word in the corpus in each book). Several immediate contributions of CPB-LEX to behavioural science research are reported, including that the new CPB-LEX frequency norms strongly predict age of acquisition and outperform comparable child-input lexical databases. The database allows researchers and practitioners to extract lexical statistics for high-frequency words which can be used to develop word lists. The paper concludes with an investigation of how CPB-LEX can be used to extend recent modelling research on the lexical diversity children receive from picture books in addition to child-directed speech. Our model shows that the vocabulary input from a relatively small number of picture books can dramatically enrich vocabulary exposure from child-directed speech and potentially assist children with vocabulary input deficits.

Spatial metabolomics is an emerging field that enables the dissection of the complex metabolic landscape and heterogeneity from a thin tissue section. Currently, spatial metabolism highlights the remarkable complexity in two-dimensional (2D) space and is poised to be extended into the three-dimensional (3D) world of biology. Here we introduce MetaVision3D, a pipeline driven by computer vision, a branch of artificial intelligence focusing on image workflow, for the transformation of serial 2D MALDI mass spectrometry imaging sections into a high-resolution 3D spatial metabolome. Our framework uses advanced algorithms for image registration, normalization and interpolation to enable the integration of serial 2D tissue sections, thereby generating a comprehensive 3D model of unique diverse metabolites across host tissues at submesoscale.

35348649,"Anti-CRISPRdb v2.2: an online repository of anti-CRISPR proteins including information on inhibitory mechanisms, activities and neighbors of curated anti-CRISPR proteins.","We previously released the Anti-CRISPRdb database hosting anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) and associated information. Since then, the number of known Acr families, types, structures and inhibitory activities has accumulated over time, and Acr neighbors can be used as a candidate pool for screening Acrs in further studies. Therefore, we here updated the database to include the new available information. Our newly updated database shows several improvements: (i) it comprises more entries and families because it includes both Acrs reported in the most recent literatures and Acrs obtained via performing homologous alignment; (ii) the prediction of Acr neighbors is integrated into Anti-CRISPRdb v2.2, and users can identify novel Acrs from these candidates; and (iii) this version includes experimental information on the inhibitory strength and stage for Acr-Cas/Acr-CRISPR pairs, motivating the development of tools for predicting specific inhibitory abilities. Additionally, a parameter, the rank of codon usage bias (CUBRank), was proposed and provided in the new version, which showed a positive relationship with predicted result from AcRanker; hence, it can be used as an indicator for proteins to be Acrs. CUBRank can be used to estimate the possibility of genes occurring within genome island-a hotspot hosting potential genes encoding Acrs. Based on CUBRank and Anti-CRISPRdb, we also gave the first glimpse for the emergence of Acr genes (acrs).<h4>Database url</h4>http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb.",True,False,4.0,,risprdb,,16.698007099999998,ok,,anti-crisprdb | cubrank,,v2,0.6980071,Anti-CRISPRdb,True,6.0,False,False,http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb,http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb,True,...mergence of Acr genes (acrs).<h4>Database url</h4>http://guolab.whu.edu.cn/anti-CRISPRdb.,1
39401061,The Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal and Duotang: open resources for SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences and genomic epidemiology.,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a large global effort to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patient samples to track viral evolution and inform the public health response. Millions of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been deposited in global public repositories. The Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN - VirusSeq), a consortium tasked with coordinating expanded sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes across Canada early in the pandemic, created the Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal, with associated data pipelines and procedures, to support these efforts. The goal of VirusSeq was to allow open access to Canadian SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and enhanced, standardized contextual data that were unavailable in other repositories and that meet FAIR standards (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). In addition, the portal data submission pipeline contains data quality checking procedures and appropriate acknowledgement of data generators that encourages collaboration. From inception to execution, the portal was developed with a conscientious focus on strong data governance principles and practices. Extensive efforts ensured a commitment to Canadian privacy laws, data security standards, and organizational processes. This portal has been coupled with other resources, such as Viral AI, and was further leveraged by the Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network (CoVaRR-Net) to produce a suite of continually updated analytical tools and notebooks. Here we highlight this portal (https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/), including its contextual data not available elsewhere, and the Duotang (https://covarr-net.github.io/duotang/duotang.html), a web platform that presents key genomic epidemiology and modelling analyses on circulating and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in Canada. Duotang presents dynamic changes in variant composition of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada and by province, estimates variant growth, and displays complementary interactive visualizations, with a text overview of the current situation. The VirusSeq Data Portal and Duotang resources, alongside additional analyses and resources computed from the portal (COVID-MVP, CoVizu), are all open source and freely available.

35809063,RNAloops: a database of RNA multiloops.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Knowledge of the 3D structure of RNA supports discovering its functions and is crucial for designing drugs and modern therapeutic solutions. Thus, much attention is devoted to experimental determination and computational prediction targeting the global fold of RNA and its local substructures. The latter include multi-branched loops-functionally significant elements that highly affect the spatial shape of the entire molecule. Unfortunately, their computational modeling constitutes a weak point of structural bioinformatics. A remedy for this is in collecting these motifs and analyzing their features.<h4>Results</h4>RNAloops is a self-updating database that stores multi-branched loops identified in the PDB-deposited RNA structures.

35839778,Pan-cancer proteomic map of 949 human cell lines.,"The proteome provides unique insights into disease biology beyond the genome and transcriptome. A lack of large proteomic datasets has restricted the identification of new cancer biomarkers. Here, proteomes of 949 cancer cell lines across 28 tissue types are analyzed by mass spectrometry. Deploying a workflow to quantify 8,498 proteins, these data capture evidence of cell-type and post-transcriptional modifications. Integrating multi-omics, drug response, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens with a deep learning-based pipeline reveals thousands of protein biomarkers of cancer vulnerabilities that are not significant at the transcript level. The power of the proteome to predict drug response is very similar to that of the transcriptome. Further, random downsampling to only 1,500 proteins has limited impact on predictive power, consistent with protein networks being highly connected and co-regulated.

36309134,MPAD: A Database for Binding Affinity of Membrane Protein-protein Complexes and their Mutants.,"Membrane protein complexes are crucial for a large variety of biological functions which are mainly dictated by their binding affinity. Due to the intricate nature of their structure, however, the binding affinity of membrane proteins is less explored compared to globular proteins. Mutations in these complexes affect their binding affinity, as well as impair critical functions, and may lead to diseases. Although experimental binding affinity data have expanded in the literature, they are dispersed and it is necessary to compile them into a reliable and comprehensive database. Hence, we developed MPAD (Membrane Protein complex binding Affinity Database), which contains experimental binding affinities of membrane protein-protein complexes and their mutants along with sequence, structure, and functional information, membrane-specific features, experimental conditions, as well as literature information. MPAD has an easy-to-use interface and options to build search queries, display, sort, download, and upload the data are among the other features available to users. This database can be used to understand the factors influencing the binding affinity in membrane proteins when compared to globular proteins as well as the impact of mutations on binding affinity, which may have potential applications to structure-based drug design.

38765608,NTCdb: Single-cell transcriptome database of human inflammatory-associated diseases.,"With both the advancement of technology and the decline in costs, single-cell transcriptomics sequencing has become widespread in the biomedical area in recent years. It can facilitate the pathogenic characteristics at the single-cell level, which will assist clinical researchers in exploring the mechanism of diseases. As a result, single-cell transcriptome data based on clinical samples grew exponentially. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive database about immunocytes in inflammatory-associated diseases. To address this deficiency, we propose a human inflammatory-associated disease-based single-cell transcriptome database, NTCdb (www.ntcdb.org.cn).

36732606,The human microbial exposome: expanding the Exposome-Explorer database with gut microbial metabolites.,"Metabolites produced by the gut microbiota play an important role in the cross-talk with the human host. Many microbial metabolites are biologically active and can pass the gut barrier and make it into the systemic circulation, where they form the gut microbial exposome, i.e. the totality of gut microbial metabolites in body fluids or tissues of the host. A major difficulty faced when studying the microbial exposome and its role in health and diseases is to differentiate metabolites solely or partially derived from microbial metabolism from those produced by the host or coming from the diet. Our objective was to collect data from the scientific literature and build a database on gut microbial metabolites and on evidence of their microbial origin. Three types of evidence on the microbial origin of the gut microbial exposome were defined: (1) metabolites are produced in vitro by human faecal bacteria; (2) metabolites show reduced concentrations in humans or experimental animals upon treatment with antibiotics; (3) metabolites show reduced concentrations in germ-free animals when compared with conventional animals. Data was manually collected from peer-reviewed publications and inserted in the Exposome-Explorer database. Furthermore, to explore the chemical space of the microbial exposome and predict metabolites uniquely formed by the microbiota, genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) of gut bacterial strains and humans were compared. A total of 1848 records on one or more types of evidence on the gut microbial origin of 457 metabolites was collected in Exposome-Explorer. Data on their known precursors and concentrations in human blood, urine and faeces was also collected. About 66% of the predicted gut microbial metabolites (n = 1543) were found to be unique microbial metabolites not found in the human GSMM, neither in the list of 457 metabolites curated in Exposome-Explorer, and can be targets for new experimental studies.

38872612,MARS and RNAcmap3: The Master Database of All Possible RNA Sequences Integrated with RNAcmap for RNA Homology Search.,"Recent success of AlphaFold2 in protein structure prediction relied heavily on co-evolutionary information derived from homologous protein sequences found in the huge, integrated database of protein sequences (Big Fantastic Database). In contrast, the existing nucleotide databases were not consolidated to facilitate wider and deeper homology search. Here, we built a comprehensive database by incorporating the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences from RNAcentral, the transcriptome assembly and metagenome assembly from metagenomics RAST (MG-RAST), the genomic sequences from Genome Warehouse (GWH), and the genomic sequences from MGnify, in addition to the nucleotide (nt) database and its subsets in National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The resulting Master database of All possible RNA sequences (MARS) is 20-fold larger than NCBI's nt database or 60-fold larger than RNAcentral. The new dataset along with a new split-search strategy allows a substantial improvement in homology search over existing state-of-the-art techniques. It also yields more accurate and more sensitive multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) than manually curated MSAs from Rfam for the majority of structured RNAs mapped to Rfam. The results indicate that MARS coupled with the fully automatic homology search tool RNAcmap will be useful for improved structural and functional inference of ncRNAs and RNA language models based on MSAs.

38395961,"""DompeKeys"": a set of novel substructure-based descriptors for efficient chemical space mapping, development and structural interpretation of machine learning models, and indexing of large databases.","The conversion of chemical structures into computer-readable descriptors, able to capture key structural aspects, is of pivotal importance in the field of cheminformatics and computer-aided drug design. Molecular fingerprints represent a widely employed class of descriptors; however, their generation process is time-consuming for large databases and is susceptible to bias. Therefore, descriptors able to accurately detect predefined structural fragments and devoid of lengthy generation procedures would be highly desirable. To meet additional needs, such descriptors should also be interpretable by medicinal chemists, and suitable for indexing databases with trillions of compounds. To this end, we developed-as integral part of EXSCALATE, Dompé's end-to-end drug discovery platform-the DompeKeys (DK), a new substructure-based descriptor set, which encodes the chemical features that characterize compounds of pharmaceutical interest. DK represent an exhaustive collection of curated SMARTS strings, defining chemical features at different levels of complexity, from specific functional groups and structural patterns to simpler pharmacophoric points, corresponding to a network of hierarchically interconnected substructures. Because of their extended and hierarchical structure, DK can be used, with good performance, in different kinds of applications. In particular, we demonstrate how they are very well suited for effective mapping of chemical space, as well as substructure search and virtual screening. Notably, the incorporation of DK yields highly performing machine learning models for the prediction of both compounds' activity and metabolic reaction occurrence.

37101150,MDSi: Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica.,"<h4>Background</h4>Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) harbors the small diploid genome (~ 450 Mb) and shows the high inbreeding rate and close relationship to several major foods, feed, fuel and bioenergy grasses. Previously, we created a mini foxtail millet, xiaomi, with an Arabidopsis-like life cycle. The de novo assembled genome data with high-quality and an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system made xiaomi an ideal C<sub>4</sub> model system. The mini foxtail millet has been widely shared in the research community and as a result there is a growing need for a user-friendly portal and intuitive interface to perform exploratory analysis of the data.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we built a Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica (MDSi, http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm ), that contains xiaomi genome of 161,844 annotations, 34,436 protein-coding genes and their expression information in 29 different tissues of xiaomi (6) and JG21 (23) samples that can be showed as an Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph (xEFP) in-situ. Moreover, the whole-genome resequencing (WGS) data of 398 germplasms, including 360 foxtail millets and 38 green foxtails and the corresponding metabolic data were available in MDSi. The SNPs and Indels of these germplasms were called in advance and can be searched and compared in an interactive manner. Common tools including BLAST, GBrowse, JBrowse, map viewer, and data downloads were implemented in MDSi.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The MDSi constructed in this study integrated and visualized data from three levels of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, and also provides information on the variation of hundreds of germplasm resources that can satisfies the mainstream requirements and supports the corresponding research community.",True,False,4.5,,omics database,,16.65356284,ok,,multi-omics database for | mdsi.<h4,mdsi | xiaomi,v2,0.65356284,MDSi,True,5.0,False,False,http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm,http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm,True,"...a Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica (MDSi, http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm ), that contains xiaomi genome of 161,844 annotat...",1
35147037,PPI-Hotspot<sup>DB</sup>: Database of Protein-Protein Interaction Hot Spots.,"Single-point mutations of certain residues (so-called hot spots) impair/disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs), leading to pathogenesis and drug resistance. Conventionally, a PPI-hot spot is identified when its replacement decreased the binding free energy significantly, generally by ≥2 kcal/mol. The relatively few mutations with such a significant binding free energy drop limited the number of distinct PPI-hot spots. By defining PPI-hot spots based on mutations that have been manually curated in UniProtKB to significantly impair/disrupt PPIs in addition to binding free energy changes, we have greatly expanded the number of distinct PPI-hot spots by an order of magnitude. These experimentally determined PPI-hot spots along with available structures have been collected in a database called PPI-Hotspot<sup>DB</sup>. We have applied the PPI-Hotspot<sup>DB</sup> to create a nonredundant benchmark, PPI-Hotspot+PDB<sup>BM</sup>, for assessing methods to predict PPI-hot spots using the free structure as input. PPI-Hotspot<sup>DB</sup> will benefit the design of mutagenesis experiments and development of PPI-hot spot prediction methods.

In early 2020, we developed a manually curated database named 'lncR2metasta' to provide a comprehensive repository for long ncRNA (lncRNA) regulation during CMEs. We updated this database by supplementing other two important ncRNA types, microRNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), for their involvement during CMEs after a thorough manual curation from published studies. ncR2metasta documents 1565 lncRNA-associated, 882 miRNA-associated, and 628 circRNA-associated entries for ncRNA-CME associations during 50 CMEs across 63 human cancer subtypes. ncR2Met has a concise web interface for researchers to easily browse, search and download as well as to submit novel ncRNA-CME associations.

35150127,GNIFdb: a neoantigen intrinsic feature database for glioma.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Neoantigens are mutation-containing immunogenic peptides from tumor cells. Neoantigen intrinsic features are neoantigens' sequence-associated features characterized by different amino acid descriptors and physical-chemical properties, which have a crucial function in prioritization of neoantigens with immunogenic potentials and predicting patients with better survival. Different intrinsic features might have functions to varying degrees in evaluating neoantigens' potentials of immunogenicity. Identification and comparison of intrinsic features among neoantigens are particularly important for developing neoantigen-based personalized immunotherapy. However, there is still no public repository to host the intrinsic features of neoantigens. Therefore, we developed GNIFdb, a glioma neoantigen intrinsic feature database specifically designed for hosting, exploring and visualizing neoantigen and intrinsic features. The database provides a comprehensive repository of computationally predicted Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) restricted neoantigens and their intrinsic features; a systematic annotation of neoantigens including sequence, neoantigen-associated mutation, gene expression, glioma prognosis, HLA-I subtype and binding affinity between neoantigens and HLA-I; and a genome browser to visualize them in an interactive manner.

39874126,BbGSD: Black-boned Sheep Genome SNP Database.,"Lanping black-boned (LPBB) sheep are a unique and rare ruminant species, characterized by black pigmentation in the skin and internal organs. Thus far, LPBB are the only known animal with heritable melanin characteristics besides the black-boned chicken, and the only mammal known to contain a large amount of melanin in the body. LPBB have therefore attracted substantial research attention, due to their potential contribution to medicine. However, long periods of grazing freely and crossbreeding with Lanping normal sheep (LPN) have diluted LPBB breeding resources, posing a challenge to the protection of species. To ensure the effective conservation and management of LPBB genetic resources, the construction of a large-scale database of genotypic information is therefore very important. To achieve this, we established the first LPBB-specific SNP database, named Black-boned Sheep Genome SNP Database (BbGSD, http://202.203.179.115:3838/oarsnpdb) using sheep genotype data (100 LPBB and 50 LPN) across 46 894 242 SNP sites. In this database, we implemented four main function modules: (i) the ""LD heatmap"" module, which uses a heatmap to enable the interactive visualization of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) measurements between SNPs; (ii) the ""SNP distribution"" module, which allows users to interactively visualize tabular genotype data as heat maps; (iii) the ""Phylogenetics"" module which enables phylogenetic analysis to explore the evolutionary history or genetic relationships of the LPBB sheep; and the ""Diversity"" module, which can be used to calculate and display the nucleotide diversity among sheep populations in user-specified genomic regions. BbGSD is essential for accelerating studies on the functional genomics and screening of molecular markers of molecular-assisted breeding in black-boned sheep.

The GWAS included 110 000 participants. The dissemination of the genetic association data through a data portal called GWAS Explorer, in a manner that addresses the modern expectations of FAIR reusability by data scientists and engineers, is the main motivation for the development of the open-source JavaScript software development kit (SDK) reported here.<h4>Results</h4>The PLCO GWAS Explorer resource relies on a public stateless HTTP application programming interface (API) deployed as the sole backend service for both the landing page's web application and third-party analytical workflows. The core PLCOjs SDK is mapped to each of the API methods, and also to each of the reference graphic visualizations in the GWAS Explorer. A few additional visualization methods extend it.

Disruption of chromatin loops is associated with many diseases, such as cancer and polydactyly. A few methods, including ChIA-PET, HiChIP and PLAC-Seq, have been proposed to detect high-resolution, specific protein-mediated chromatin loops. With rapid progress in 3D genomic research, ChIA-PET, HiChIP and PLAC-Seq datasets continue to accumulate, and effective collection and processing for these datasets are urgently needed. Here, we developed a comprehensive, multispecies and specific protein-mediated chromatin loop database (ChromLoops, https://3dgenomics.hzau.edu.cn/chromloops), which integrated 1030 ChIA-PET, HiChIP and PLAC-Seq datasets from 13 species, and documented 1 491 416 813 high-quality chromatin loops.

35222847,ADDAGMA: A database for domestic animal gut microbiome atlas.,"Animal gut microbiomes play important roles in the health, diseases, and production of animal hosts. The volume of animal gut metagenomic data, including both 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data, has been increasing exponentially in recent years, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to query, retrieve, and reanalyze experimental data and explore new hypotheses. We designed a database called the domestic animal gut microbiome atlas (ADDAGMA) to house all publicly available, high-throughput sequencing data for the gut microbiome in domestic animals. ADDAGMA enhances the availability and accessibility of the rapidly growing body of metagenomic data. We annotated microbial and metadata from four domestic animals (cattle, horse, pig, and chicken) from 356 published papers to construct a comprehensive database that is equipped with browse and search functions, enabling users to make customized, complicated, biologically relevant queries. Users can quickly and accurately obtain experimental information on sample types, conditions, and sequencing platforms, and experimental results including microbial relative abundances, microbial taxon-associated host phenotype, and P-values for gut microbes of interest.

35445695,A3D database: structure-based predictions of protein aggregation for the human proteome.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Protein aggregation is associated with many human disorders and constitutes a major bottleneck for producing therapeutic proteins. Our knowledge of the human protein structures repertoire has dramatically increased with the recent development of the AlphaFold (AF) deep-learning method. This structural information can be used to understand better protein aggregation properties and the rational design of protein solubility. This article uses the Aggrescan3D (A3D) tool to compute the structure-based aggregation predictions for the human proteome and make the predictions available in a database form. In the A3D database, we analyze the AF-predicted human protein structures (for over 20.5 thousand unique Uniprot IDs) in terms of their aggregation properties using the A3D tool. Each entry of the A3D database provides a detailed analysis of the structure-based aggregation propensity computed with A3D. The A3D database implements simple but useful graphical tools for visualizing and interpreting protein structure datasets. It also enables testing the influence of user-selected mutations on protein solubility and stability, all integrated into a user-friendly interface.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A3D database is freely available at: http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D2/hproteome.

35124170,The Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas: A searchable comparative transcriptome database for healthy and diseased human eye tissue.,"The applications of deep sequencing technologies in life science research and clinical diagnostics have increased rapidly over the last decade. Although fast algorithms for data processing exist, intuitive, portable solutions for data analysis are still rare. For this purpose, we developed a web-based transcriptome database, which provides a platform-independent, intuitive solution to easily explore and compare ocular gene expression of 100 diseased and healthy human tissue samples from 15 different tissue types collected at the Eye Center of the University of Freiburg. To ensure comparability of expression between different tissues, reads were normalized across all 100 samples. Differentially expressed genes were calculated between each tissue type to determine tissue-specific genes. Unsupervised analysis of all 100 samples revealed an accurate clustering according to different tissue types and a high tissue specificity by analyzing known tissue-specific marker genes. Bioinformatic cell type deconvolution using xCell provided detailed insights into the cellular profiles of each tissue type. Several new tissue-specific marker genes were identified. These genes were involved in tissue- or disease-specific processes, such as myelination for the optic nerve, visual perception for retina, keratinocyte differentiation for conjunctival carcinoma, as well as endothelial cell migration for choroidal neovascularization membranes. The results are accessible at the Human Eye Transcriptome Atlas website at https://www.eye-transcriptome.com.

However, functional interpretation of these SNPs remains a significant challenge. Our recent study established the concept of 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3'aQTLs), which can be used to interpret ∼16.1% of GWAS SNPs and are distinct from gene expression QTLs and splicing QTLs.

Owing to its high disease significance, there is growing interest in investigating proteolysis on the proteome scale, termed degradomics. We developed 'Database of Identified Cleavage sites Endemic to Disease states' (DICED; https://diced.lerner.ccf.org/), as a searchable knowledgebase to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing in degradomics. DICED was designed and constructed using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and PostgreSQL. Django (https://www.djangoproject.com) was chosen as the primary framework for its security features and support for agile development. DICED can be utilized on major web browsers and operating systems for easy access to high-throughput mass spectrometry-identified cleaved protein termini.

37181487,The HRA Organ Gallery affords immersive superpowers for building and exploring the Human Reference Atlas with virtual reality.,"The Human Reference Atlas (HRA, https://humanatlas.io) funded by the NIH Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP, https://commonfund.nih.gov/hubmap) and other projects engages 17 international consortia to create a spatial reference of the healthy adult human body at single-cell resolution. The specimen, biological structure, and spatial data that define the HRA are disparate in nature and benefit from a visually explicit method of data integration. Virtual reality (VR) offers unique means to enable users to explore complex data structures in a three-dimensional (3D) immersive environment. On a 2D desktop application, the 3D spatiality and real-world size of the 3D reference organs of the atlas is hard to understand. If viewed in VR, the spatiality of the organs and tissue blocks mapped to the HRA can be explored in their true size and in a way that goes beyond traditional 2D user interfaces. Added 2D and 3D visualizations can then provide data-rich context. In this paper, we present the HRA Organ Gallery, a VR application to explore the atlas in an integrated VR environment. Presently, the HRA Organ Gallery features 55 3D reference organs, 1,203 mapped tissue blocks from 292 demographically diverse donors and 15 providers that link to 6,000+ datasets; it also features prototype visualizations of cell type distributions and 3D protein structures.

37695921,The antimicrobial peptide database is 20 years old: Recent developments and future directions.,"In 2023, the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (currently available at https://aps.unmc.edu) is 20-years-old. The timeline for the APD expansion in peptide entries, classification methods, search functions, post-translational modifications, binding targets, and mechanisms of action of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) has been summarized in our previous Protein Science paper. This article highlights new database additions and findings. To facilitate antimicrobial development to combat drug-resistant pathogens, the APD has been re-annotating the data for antibacterial activity (active, inactive, and uncertain), toxicity (hemolytic and nonhemolytic AMPs), and salt tolerance (salt sensitive and insensitive). Comparison of the respective desired and undesired AMP groups produces new knowledge for peptide design. Our unification of AMPs from the six life kingdoms into ""natural AMPs"" enabled the first comparison with globular or transmembrane proteins. Due to the dominance of amphipathic helical and disulfide-linked peptides, cysteine, glycine, and lysine in natural AMPs are much more abundant than those in globular proteins. To include peptides predicted by machine learning, a new ""predicted"" group has been created. Remarkably, the averaged amino acid composition of predicted peptides is located between the lower bound of natural AMPs and the upper bound of synthetic peptides. Synthetic peptides in the current APD, with the highest cationic and hydrophobic amino acid percentages, are mostly designed with varying degrees of optimization. Hence, natural AMPs accumulated in the APD over 20 years have laid the foundation for machine learning prediction. We discuss future directions for peptide discovery. It is anticipated that the APD will continue to play a role in research and education.",True,False,4.5,,antimicrobial peptide,,16.567693650000002,ok,apd | antimicrobial peptide database,the antimicrobial peptide database | antimicrobial peptide database,apd,v2,0.56769365,antimicrobial peptide database is years old,True,5.0,False,False,https://aps.unmc.edu,https://aps.unmc.edu,True,...icrobial Peptide Database (currently available at https://aps.unmc.edu) is 20-years-old.

Chemical probes are high-quality small-molecule reagents, often inhibitors, that are important for exploring protein function and biological mechanisms, and for validating targets for drug discovery. The publication, dissemination and use of chemical probes provide an important means to accelerate the functional annotation of proteins, the study of proteins in cell biology, physiology, and disease pathology, and to inform and enable subsequent pioneering drug discovery and development efforts. However, the widespread use of small-molecule compounds that are claimed as chemical probes but are lacking sufficient quality, especially being inadequately selective for the desired target or even broadly promiscuous in behaviour, has resulted in many erroneous conclusions in the biomedical literature. The Chemical Probes Portal was established as a public resource to aid the selection and best-practice use of chemical probes in basic and translational biomedical research.

The TCM Plant Genome Project aimed to obtain genetic information, determine gene functions, discover regulatory networks of herbal species, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease prevention and treatment, thereby accelerating the modernization of TCMs. A comprehensive database that contains TCM-related information will provide a vital resource. Here, we present an integrative genome database of TCM plants (IGTCM) that contains 14,711,220 records of 83 annotated TCM-related herb genomes, including 3,610,350 genes, 3,534,314 proteins and corresponding coding sequences, and 4,032,242 RNAs, as well as 1033 non-redundant component records for 68 herbs, downloaded and integrated from the GenBank and RefSeq databases. For minimal interconnectivity, each gene, protein, and component was annotated using the eggNOG-mapper tool and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database to acquire pathway information and enzyme classifications. These features can be linked across several species and different components. The IGTCM database also provides visualization and sequence similarity search tools for data analyses. These annotated herb genome sequences in IGTCM database are a necessary resource for systematically exploring genes related to the biosynthesis of compounds that have significant medicinal activities and excellent agronomic traits that can be used to improve TCM-related varieties through molecular breeding.

36006844,CPMCP: a database of Chinese patent medicine and compound prescription.,"Although several traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-related databases have emerged, they focus on researching single medicinal materials, which is far from sufficient for clinical research and application. In comparison, compound prescriptions are more informative and meaningful in TCM, for they embody the information on the compatibility of TCM besides the relatively isolated information about single medicinal materials. The compatibility information is essential in TCM because it conveys not only what components are involved to treat special diseases but also how to combine these single medical materials. We established a database of Chinese patent medicine and compound prescription (CPMCP). It demonstrates the prescription information of Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) and ancient Chinese medicine prescriptions (CMPs). CPMCP reports their comprehensive and standardized information such as the components, indications and contraindications. It is worth mentioning that we organized relevant experts and spent lots of time manually mapping the functions of compound prescriptions in ancient Chinese to the standardized TCM symptom vocabularies, obtaining a total of 71 414 associations between compound prescriptions and TCM symptoms. In this way, CPMCP established the associations between TCM and modern medicine (MM) according to the associations between TCM symptoms and MM symptoms. In addition, to further exhibit the compatibility mechanism of compound prescriptions, CPMCP summarizes a set of common drug combination principles by analyzing the existing prescriptions.

39497074,GPCR-BSD: a database of binding sites of human G-protein coupled receptors under diverse states.,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of membrane proteins in human body, involve a great variety of biological processes and thus have become highly valuable drug targets. By binding with ligands (e.g., drugs), GPCRs switch between active and inactive conformational states, thereby performing functions such as signal transmission. The changes in binding pockets under different states are important for a better understanding of drug-target interactions. Therefore it is critical, as well as a practical need, to obtain binding sites in human GPCR structures. We report a database (called GPCR-BSD) that collects 127,990 predicted binding sites of 803 GPCRs under active and inactive states (thus 1,606 structures in total). The binding sites were identified from the predicted GPCR structures by executing three geometric-based pocket prediction methods, fpocket, CavityPlus and GHECOM. The server provides query, visualization, and comparison of the predicted binding sites for both GPCR predicted and experimentally determined structures recorded in PDB. We evaluated the identified pockets of 132 experimentally determined human GPCR structures in terms of pocket residue coverage, pocket center distance and redocking accuracy. The evaluation showed that fpocket and CavityPlus methods performed better and successfully predicted orthosteric binding sites in over 60% of the 132 experimentally determined structures.

Considering the limitations of existing Chinese auditory stimulus database studies, we developed and validated an emotional auditory stimuli database composed of Chinese pseudo-sentences, recorded by six professional actors in Mandarin Chinese. Emotional expressions included happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, pleasant surprise, and neutrality. All emotional categories were vocalized into two types of sentence patterns, declarative and interrogative. In addition, all emotional pseudo-sentences, except for neutral, were vocalized at two levels of emotional intensity: normal and strong. Each recording was validated with 40 native Chinese listeners in terms of the recognition accuracy of the intended emotion portrayal; finally, 4361 pseudo-sentence stimuli were included in the database. Validation of the database using a forced-choice recognition paradigm revealed high rates of emotional recognition accuracy. The detailed acoustic attributes of vocalization were provided and connected to the emotion recognition rates. This corpus could be a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians to explore the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying emotion processing of the general population and emotional disturbances in neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders.

The bHLH proteins form one of the largest families of transcription factors found in plants that act as homo- or heterodimers to regulate the expression of their target genes. The bHLH transcription factor is involved in many aspects of plant development and metabolism, including photomorphogenesis, light signal transduction, secondary metabolism, and stress response. The amount of molecular data has increased dramatically with the development of high-throughput techniques and wide use of bioinformatics techniques. The most efficient way to use this information is to store and analyze the data in a well-organized manner. In this study, all members of the bHLH superfamily in the plant kingdom were used to develop and implement a relational database. We have created a database called bHLHDB (www.bhlhdb.org) for the bHLH family members on which queries can be conducted based on the family or sequences information. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is frequently used by researchers for the analysis of sequences, and the BLAST query were integrated into the database. In addition, the deep learning model was developed to predict the type of TF with only the protein sequence quickly, efficiently, and with 97.54% accuracy and 97.76% precision. We created a unique and next-generation database for bHLH transcription factors and made this database available to the world of science.

36028515,RSDB: A rare skin disease database to link drugs with potential drug targets for rare skin diseases.,"Rare skin diseases include more than 800 diseases affecting more than 6.8 million patients worldwide. However, only 100 drugs have been developed for treating rare skin diseases in the past 38 years. To investigate potential treatments through drug repurposing for rare skin diseases, it is necessary to have a well-organized database to link all known disease causes, mechanisms, and related information to accelerate the process. Drug repurposing provides less expensive and faster potential options to develop treatments for known diseases. In this work, we designed and constructed a rare skin disease database (RSDB) as a disease-centered information depository to facilitate repurposing drug candidates for rare skin diseases. We collected and integrated associated genes, chemicals, and phenotypes into a network connected by pairwise relationships between different components for rare skin diseases.

At present, there is no dedicated resource for mimicked domains and motifs in the host-pathogen interactome. In this work, the experimental host-pathogen (HP) and host-host (HH) protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were collated. The domains and motifs of these proteins were annotated using CD Search and ScanProsite, respectively. Host and pathogen proteins with a shared host interactor and similar domain/motif constitute a mimicry pair exhibiting global structural similarity (domain mimicry pair; DMP) or local sequence motif similarity (motif mimicry pair; MMP). Mimicry pairs are likely to be co-expressed and co-localized. 1,97,607 DMPs and 32,67,568 MMPs were identified in 49,265 experimental HP-PPIs and organized in a web-based resource, ImitateDB ( http://imitatedb.sblab-nsit.net ) that can be easily queried.

36913438,dbAQP-SNP: a database of missense single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human aquaporins.,"Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins belong to the superfamily of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), and they transport water and other neutral solutes such as glycerol. These channel proteins are involved in vital physiological processes and are implicated in several human diseases. Experimentally determined structures of MIPs from diverse organisms reveal a unique hour-glass fold with six transmembrane helices and two half-helices. MIP channels have two constrictions formed by Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs and aromatic/arginine selectivity filters (Ar/R SFs). Several reports have found associations among single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human aquaporins (AQPs) with diseases in specific populations. In this study, we have compiled 2798 SNPs that give rise to missense mutations in 13 human AQPs. To understand the nature of missense substitutions, we have systematically analyzed the pattern of substitutions. We found several examples in which substitutions could be considered as non-conservative that include small to big or hydrophobic to charged residues. We also analyzed these substitutions in the context of structure. We have identified SNPs that occur in NPA motifs or Ar/R SFs, and they will most certainly disrupt the structure and/or transport properties of human AQPs. We found 22 examples in which missense SNP substitutions that are mostly non-conservative in nature have given rise to pathogenic conditions as found in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. It is most likely that not all missense SNPs in human AQPs will result in diseases. However, understanding the effect of missense SNPs on the structure and function of human AQPs is important. In this direction, we have developed a database dbAQP-SNP that contains information about all 2798 SNPs. This database has several features and search options that can help the user to find SNPs in specific positions of human AQPs including the functionally and/or structurally important regions. dbAQP-SNP (http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/dbAQP-SNP) is freely available to the academic community.

37831087,DNA Damage Atlas: an atlas of DNA damage and repair.,"DNA damage and its improper repair are the major source of genomic alterations responsible for many human diseases, particularly cancer. To aid researchers in understanding the underlying mechanisms of genome instability, a number of genome-wide profiling approaches have been developed to monitor DNA damage and repair events. The rapid accumulation of published datasets underscores the critical necessity of a comprehensive database to curate sequencing data on DNA damage and repair intermediates. Here, we present DNA Damage Atlas (DDA, http://www.bioinformaticspa.com/DDA/), the first large-scale repository of DNA damage and repair information. Currently, DDA comprises 6,030 samples from 262 datasets by 59 technologies, covering 16 species, 10 types of damage and 135 treatments. Data collected in DDA was processed through a standardized workflow, including quality checks, hotspots identification and a series of feature characterization for the hotspots. Notably, DDA encompasses analyses of highly repetitive regions, ribosomal DNA and telomere. DDA offers a user-friendly interface that facilitates browsing, searching, genome browser visualization, hotspots comparison and data downloading, enabling convenient and thorough exploration for datasets of interest.

37831097,PRMD: an integrated database for plant RNA modifications.,"The scope and function of RNA modifications in model plant systems have been extensively studied, resulting in the identification of an increasing number of novel RNA modifications in recent years. Researchers have gradually revealed that RNA modifications, especially N6-methyladenosine (m6A), which is one of the most abundant and commonly studied RNA modifications in plants, have important roles in physiological and pathological processes. These modifications alter the structure of RNA, which affects its molecular complementarity and binding to specific proteins, thereby resulting in various of physiological effects. The increasing interest in plant RNA modifications has necessitated research into RNA modifications and associated datasets. However, there is a lack of a convenient and integrated database with comprehensive annotations and intuitive visualization of plant RNA modifications. Here, we developed the Plant RNA Modification Database (PRMD; http://bioinformatics.sc.cn/PRMD and http://rnainformatics.org.cn/PRMD) to facilitate RNA modification research. This database contains information regarding 20 plant species and provides an intuitive interface for displaying information. Moreover, PRMD offers multiple tools, including RMlevelDiff, RMplantVar, RNAmodNet and Blast (for functional analyses), and mRNAbrowse, RNAlollipop, JBrowse and Integrative Genomics Viewer (for displaying data).

37831118,ADCdb: the database of antibody-drug conjugates.,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of innovative biopharmaceutical drugs, which, via their antibody (mAb) component, deliver and release their potent warhead (a.k.a. payload) at the disease site, thereby simultaneously improving the efficacy of delivered therapy and reducing its off-target toxicity. To design ADCs of promising efficacy, it is crucial to have the critical data of pharma-information and biological activities for each ADC. However, no such database has been constructed yet. In this study, a database named ADCdb focusing on providing ADC information (especially its pharma-information and biological activities) from multiple perspectives was thus developed. Particularly, a total of 6572 ADCs (359 approved by FDA or in clinical trial pipeline, 501 in preclinical test, 819 with in-vivo testing data, 1868 with cell line/target testing data, 3025 without in-vivo/cell line/target testing data) together with their explicit pharma-information was collected and provided. Moreover, a total of 9171 literature-reported activities were discovered, which were identified from diverse clinical trial pipelines, model organisms, patient/cell-derived xenograft models, etc. Due to the significance of ADCs and their relevant data, this new database was expected to attract broad interests from diverse research fields of current biopharmaceutical drug discovery.

37093842,"MTSviewer: A database to visualize mitochondrial targeting sequences, cleavage sites, and mutations on protein structures.","Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a wide array of human diseases ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to cardiovascular defects. The coordinated localization and import of proteins into mitochondria are essential processes that ensure mitochondrial homeostasis. The localization and import of most mitochondrial proteins are driven by N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS's), which interact with import machinery and are removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). The recent discovery of internal MTS's-those which are distributed throughout a protein and act as import regulators or secondary MPP cleavage sites-has expanded the role of both MTS's and MPP beyond conventional N-terminal regulatory pathways. Still, the global mutational landscape of MTS's remains poorly characterized, both from genetic and structural perspectives. To this end, we have integrated a variety of tools into one harmonized R/Shiny database called MTSviewer (https://neurobioinfo.github.io/MTSvieweR/), which combines MTS predictions, cleavage sites, genetic variants, pathogenicity predictions, and N-terminomics data with structural visualization using AlphaFold models of human and yeast mitochondrial proteomes.

38748636,PMBC: a manually curated database for prognostic markers of breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is notorious for its high mortality and heterogeneity, resulting in different therapeutic responses. Classical biomarkers have been identified and successfully commercially applied to predict the outcome of breast cancer patients. Accumulating biomarkers, including non-coding RNAs, have been reported as prognostic markers for breast cancer with the development of sequencing techniques. However, there are currently no databases dedicated to the curation and characterization of prognostic markers for breast cancer. Therefore, we constructed a curated database for prognostic markers of breast cancer (PMBC). PMBC consists of 1070 markers covering mRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs and circRNAs. These markers are enriched in various cancer- and epithelial-related functions including mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling. We mapped the prognostic markers into the ceRNA network from starBase. The lncRNA NEAT1 competes with 11 RNAs, including lncRNAs and mRNAs. The majority of the ceRNAs in ABAT belong to pseudogenes. The topology analysis of the ceRNA network reveals that known prognostic RNAs have higher closeness than random. Among all the biomarkers, prognostic lncRNAs have a higher degree, while prognostic mRNAs have significantly higher closeness than random RNAs. These results indicate that the lncRNAs play important roles in maintaining the interactions between lncRNAs and their ceRNAs, which might be used as a characteristic to prioritize prognostic lncRNAs based on the ceRNA network. PMBC renders a user-friendly interface and provides detailed information about individual prognostic markers, which will facilitate the precision treatment of breast cancer.

37831137,mHapBrowser: a comprehensive database for visualization and analysis of DNA methylation haplotypes.,"DNA methylation acts as a vital epigenetic regulatory mechanism involved in controlling gene expression. Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled characterization of methylation patterns at single-base resolution using bisulfite sequencing approaches. However, existing methylation databases have primarily focused on mean methylation levels, overlooking phased methylation patterns. The methylation status of CpGs on individual sequencing reads represents discrete DNA methylation haplotypes (mHaps). Here, we present mHapBrowser, a comprehensive database for visualizing and analyzing mHaps. We systematically processed data of diverse tissues in human, mouse and rat from public repositories, generating mHap format files for 6366 samples. mHapBrowser enables users to visualize eight mHap metrics across the genome through an integrated WashU Epigenome Browser. It also provides an online server for comparing mHap patterns across samples. Additionally, mHap files for all samples can be downloaded to facilitate local processing using downstream analysis toolkits. The utilities of mHapBrowser were demonstrated through three case studies: (i) mHap patterns are associated with gene expression; (ii) changes in mHap patterns independent of mean methylation correlate with differential expression between lung cancer subtypes; and (iii) the mHap metric MHL outperforms mean methylation for classifying tumor and normal samples from cell-free DNA.

They are linked to genomic instability; however, they also have various biological functions. Their distribution differs markedly across taxonomic groups in the tree of life, and they exhibit high polymorphism due to their inherent genomic instability. Advances in sequencing technologies and declined costs have enabled the generation of an ever-growing number of complete genomes for organisms across taxonomic groups in the tree of life. However, a comprehensive database encompassing inverted repeats across diverse organismal genomes has been lacking. We present invertiaDB, the first comprehensive database of inverted repeats spanning multiple taxa, featuring repeats identified in the genomes of 118 101 organisms across all major taxonomic groups. For each organism, we derived inverted repeats with arm lengths of at least 10 bp, spacer lengths up to 8 bp, and no mismatches in the arms.

However, despite the existence of reliable sources for extricating this data, it remains a challenge to accurately comprehend and draw conclusions based on the entirety of available information. Therefore, the current study aimed to design and develop a database for the identified variants of 5 different cancer types using 20 different cancer exomes. The exome data were retrieved from NCBI SRA and an NGS data clean-up protocol was implemented to obtain the best quality reads. The reads which passed the quality checks were then used for calling the variants which were then processed and filtered. This data was used to normalize and the normalized data generated was used for developing the database. MutaXome, which stands for mutations in cancer exome was designed in SQL, with the front end in bootstrap and HTML, and backend in PHP.

The aggregation of a presynaptic protein, α-synuclein (aSyn), is the primary neurological hallmark of PD and, thus, a promising target for therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of consensus on the molecular properties required to specifically bind the toxic species formed during aSyn aggregation has hindered the development of therapeutic molecules. Recently, we defined and experimentally validated a peptide architecture that demonstrated high affinity and selectivity in binding to aSyn toxic oligomers and fibrils, effectively preventing aSyn pathogenic aggregation. Human peptides with such properties may have neuroprotective activities and hold a huge therapeutic interest. Driven by this idea, here, we developed a discriminative algorithm for the screening of human endogenous neuropeptides, antimicrobial peptides and diet-derived bioactive peptides with the potential to inhibit aSyn aggregation. We identified over 100 unique biogenic peptide candidates and ensembled a comprehensive database (aSynPEP-DB) that collects their physicochemical features, source datasets and additional therapeutic-relevant information, including their sites of expression and associated pathways.

38994794,DrugRepoBank: a comprehensive database and discovery platform for accelerating drug repositioning.,"In recent years, drug repositioning has emerged as a promising alternative to the time-consuming, expensive and risky process of developing new drugs for diseases. However, the current database for drug repositioning faces several issues, including insufficient data volume, restricted data types, algorithm inaccuracies resulting from the neglect of multidimensional or heterogeneous data, a lack of systematic organization of literature data associated with drug repositioning, limited analytical capabilities and user-unfriendly webpage interfaces. Hence, we have established the first all-encompassing database called DrugRepoBank, consisting of two main modules: the 'Literature' module and the 'Prediction' module. The 'Literature' module serves as the largest repository of literature-supported drug repositioning data with experimental evidence, encompassing 169 repositioned drugs from 134 articles from 1 January 2000 to 1 July 2023. The 'Prediction' module employs 18 efficient algorithms, including similarity-based, artificial-intelligence-based, signature-based and network-based methods to predict repositioned drug candidates. The DrugRepoBank features an interactive and user-friendly web interface and offers comprehensive functionalities such as bioinformatics analysis of disease signatures. When users provide information about a drug, target or disease of interest, DrugRepoBank offers new indications and targets for the drug, proposes new drugs that bind to the target or suggests potential drugs for the queried disease. Additionally, it provides basic information about drugs, targets or diseases, along with supporting literature. We utilize three case studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of predictively repositioned drugs within DrugRepoBank. The establishment of the DrugRepoBank database will significantly accelerate the pace of drug repositioning.

39961523,CAZyme3D: A Database of 3D Structures for Carbohydrate-active Enzymes.,"CAZymes (Carbohydrate Active EnZymes) degrade, synthesize, and modify all complex carbohydrates on Earth. CAZymes are extremely important to research in human health, nutrition, gut microbiome, bioenergy, plant disease, and global carbon recycling. Current CAZyme annotation tools are all based on sequence similarity. A more powerful approach is to detect protein structural similarity between query proteins and known CAZymes indicative of distant homology. Here, we developed CAZyme3D (https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/) to fill the research gap that no dedicated 3D structure databases are currently available for CAZymes. CAZyme3D contains a total of 870,740 AlphaFold predicted 3D structures (named Whole dataset). A subset of CAZymes 3D structures from 188,574 nonredundant sequences (named ID50 dataset) were subject to structural similarity-based clustering analyses. Such clustering allowed us to organize all CAZyme structures using a hierarchical classification, which includes existing levels defined by the CAZy database (class, clan, family, subfamily) and newly defined levels (subclasses, structural cluster [SC] groups, and SCs). The inter-family structural clustering successfully grouped CAZy families and clans with the same structural folds in the same subclasses. The intra-family structural clustering classified structurally similar CAZymes into SCs, which were further classified into SC groups. SCs and SC groups differed from sequence similarity-based CAZy subfamilies. With CAZyme structures as the search database, we created job submission pages, where users can submit query protein sequences or PDB structures for a structural similarity search. CAZyme3D will be a useful new tool to assist the discovery of novel CAZymes by providing a comprehensive database of CAZyme 3D structures.",True,False,4.0,,cazyme3d,cazy,16.0,conflict,,alphafold,pdb,spacy,0.0,CAZyme3D,True,5.0,True,True,https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/,https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/,True,"...of distant homology.

Consequently, huge amounts of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data concerning cotton species have been generated and released. These large-scale data provide immense opportunities for the study of cotton genomic structure and evolution, population genetic diversity and genome-wide mining of excellent genes for important traits. However, the complexity of NGS data also causes distress, as it cannot be utilized easily. Here, we presented the cotton omics data platform COTTONOMICS (http://cotton.zju.edu.cn/), an easily accessible web database that integrates 32.5 TB of omics data including seven assembled genomes, resequencing data from 1180 allotetraploid cotton accessions and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), small RNA-sequencing (smRNA-seq), Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), DNase hypersensitive sites sequencing (DNase-seq) and Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq).

34718689,ARTS-DB: a database for antibiotic resistant targets.,"As a result of the continuous evolution of drug resistant bacteria, new antibiotics are urgently needed. Encoded by biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), antibiotic compounds are mostly produced by bacteria. With the exponential increase in the number of publicly available, sequenced genomes and the advancements of BGC prediction tools, genome mining algorithms have uncovered millions of uncharacterized BGCs for further evaluation. Since compound identification and characterization remain bottlenecks, a major challenge is prioritizing promising BGCs. Recently, researchers adopted self-resistance based strategies allowing them to predict the biological activities of natural products encoded by uncharacterized BGCs. Since 2017, the Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS) facilitated this so-called target-directed genome mining (TDGM) approach for the prioritization of BGCs encoding potentially novel antibiotics. Here, we present the ARTS database, available at https://arts-db.ziemertlab.com/. The ARTS database provides pre-computed ARTS results for >70,000 genomes and metagenome assembled genomes in total.

34718696,Proteome-pI 2.0: proteome isoelectric point database update.,"Proteome-pI 2.0 is an update of an online database containing predicted isoelectric points and pKa dissociation constants of proteins and peptides. The isoelectric point-the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge-is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques. Additionally, it can be obtained directly from the pKa values of individual charged residues of the protein. The Proteome-pI 2.0 database includes data for over 61 million protein sequences from 20 115 proteomes (three to four times more than the previous release). The isoelectric point for proteins is predicted by 21 methods, whereas pKa values are inferred by one method. To facilitate bottom-up proteomics analysis, individual proteomes were digested in silico with the five most commonly used proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, trypsin + LysC, LysN, ArgC), and the peptides' isoelectric point and molecular weights were calculated. The database enables the retrieval of virtual 2D-PAGE plots and customized fractions of a proteome based on the isoelectric point and molecular weight.

35685362,dbEssLnc: A manually curated database of human and mouse essential lncRNA genes.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes. Knocking out or knocking down some lncRNAs will lead to lethality or infertility. These lncRNAs are called essential lncRNAs. Knowledges of essential lncRNAs are important in establishing minimal genomes of living cells, developing drug therapies and early diagnostic approaches for complex diseases. However, existing databases focus on collecting essential coding genes. Essential non-coding gene records are rare in existing databases. A comprehensive collection of essential non-coding genes, particularly essential lncRNA genes, is demanded. We manually curated 207 essential lncRNAs from literatures for establishing a database on essential lncRNAs, which is named as dbEssLnc (Database of essential lncRNAs).

35685370,DisPhaseDB: An integrative database of diseases related variations in liquid-liquid phase separation proteins.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteins involved in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and membraneless organelles (MLOs) are recognized to be decisive for many biological processes and also responsible for several diseases. The recent explosion of research in the area still lacks tools for the analysis and data integration among different repositories. Currently, there is not a comprehensive and dedicated database that collects all disease-related variations in combination with the protein location, biological role in the MLO, and all the metadata available for each protein and disease. Disease-related protein variants and additional features are dispersed and the user has to navigate many databases, with a different focus, formats, and often not user friendly.<h4>Results</h4>We present DisPhaseDB, a database dedicated to disease-related variants of liquid-liquid phase separation proteins. It integrates 10 databases, contains 5,741 proteins, 1,660,059 variants, and 4,051 disease terms. It also offers intuitive navigation and an informative display.

34718715,OncoDB: an interactive online database for analysis of gene expression and viral infection in cancer.,"Large-scale multi-omics datasets, most prominently from the TCGA consortium, have been made available to the public for systematic characterization of human cancers. However, to date, there is a lack of corresponding online resources to utilize these valuable data to study gene expression dysregulation and viral infection, two major causes for cancer development and progression. To address these unmet needs, we established OncoDB, an online database resource to explore abnormal patterns in gene expression as well as viral infection that are correlated to clinical features in cancer. Specifically, OncoDB integrated RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and related clinical data from over 10 000 cancer patients in the TCGA study as well as from normal tissues in the GTEx study. Another unique aspect of OncoDB is its focus on oncoviruses. By mining TCGA RNA-seq data, we have identified six major oncoviruses across cancer types and further correlated viral infection to changes in host gene expression and clinical outcomes. All the analysis results are integratively presented in OncoDB with a flexible web interface to search for data related to RNA expression, DNA methylation, viral infection, and clinical features of the cancer patients.

Improved understandings of the phenotypic changes of immune cells during sepsis and the driving molecular mechanisms are critical to the elucidation of sepsis pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which interprets transcriptome at a single-cell resolution, serves as a useful tool to uncover disease-related gene expression signatures of different cell populations in various diseases. It has also been applied to studies on sepsis immunopathological mechanisms. Due to the fact that most sepsis-related studies utilizing scRNA-seq have very small sample sizes and there is a lack of an scRNA-seq database for sepsis, we developed Sepsis Single-cell Whole Gene Expression Database Website (SC2sepsis) (http://www.rjh-sc2sepsis.com/), integrating scRNA-seq datasets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 45 septic patients and 26 healthy controls, with a total amount of 232 226 cells.

ChIP-Atlas is powered by comprehensively integrating all data sets from high-throughput ChIP-seq and DNase-seq, a method for profiling chromatin regions accessible to DNase. In this update, we further collected all the ATAC-seq and whole-genome bisulfite-seq data for six model organisms (human, mouse, rat, fruit fly, nematode, and budding yeast) with the latest genome assemblies. These together with ChIP-seq data can be visualized with the Peak Browser tool and a genome browser to explore the epigenomic landscape of a query genomic locus, such as its chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation status, and protein-genome interactions. This epigenomic landscape can also be characterized for multiple genes and genomic loci by querying with the Enrichment Analysis tool, which, for example, revealed that inflammatory bowel disease-associated SNPs are the most significantly hypo-methylated in neutrophils. Therefore, ChIP-Atlas provides a panoramic view of the whole epigenomic landscape.

39404857,DeOri 10.0: An Updated Database of Experimentally Identified Eukaryotic Replication Origins.,"DNA replication is a complex and crucial biological process in eukaryotes. To facilitate the study of eukaryotic replication events, we present a database of eukaryotic DNA replication origins (DeOri), which collects genome-wide data on eukaryotic DNA replication origins currently available. With the rapid development of high-throughput experimental technology in recent years, the number of datasets in the new release of DeOri 10.0 increased from 10 to 151 and the number of sequences increased from 16,145 to 9,742,396. Besides nucleotide sequences and browser extensible data (BED) files, corresponding annotation files, such as coding sequences (CDSs), mRNAs, and other biological elements within replication origins, are also provided. The experimental techniques used for each dataset, as well as related statistical data, are also presented on web page. Differences in experimental methods, cell lines, and sequencing technologies have resulted in distinct replication origins, making it challenging to differentiate between cell-specific and non-specific replication origins. Based on multiple replication origin datasets at the species level, we scored and screened replication origins in Homo sapiens, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. The screened regions with high scores were considered as species-conservative origins, which are integrated and presented as reference replication origins (rORIs). Additionally, we analyzed the distribution of relevant genomic elements associated with replication origins at the genome level, such as CpG island (CGI), transcription start site (TSS), and G-quadruplex (G4).

34850116,PLSDB: advancing a comprehensive database of bacterial plasmids.,"Plasmids are known to contain genes encoding for virulence factors and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Their relevance in metagenomic data processing is steadily growing. However, with the increasing popularity and scale of metagenomics experiments, the number of reported plasmids is rapidly growing as well, amassing a considerable number of false positives due to undetected misassembles. Here, our previously published database PLSDB provides a reliable resource for researchers to quickly compare their sequences against selected and annotated previous findings. Within two years, the size of this resource has more than doubled from the initial 13,789 to now 34,513 entries over the course of eight regular data updates. For this update, we aggregated community feedback for major changes to the database featuring new analysis functionality as well as performance, quality, and accessibility improvements. New filtering steps, annotations, and preprocessing of existing records improve the quality of the provided data. Additionally, new features implemented in the web-server ease user interaction and allow for a deeper understanding of custom uploaded sequences, by visualizing similarity information.

38028612,DASES: a database of alternative splicing for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Esophageal carcinoma ranks as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) being particularly prevalent among Asian populations. Alternative splicing (AS) plays a pivotal role in ESCC development and progression by generating diverse transcript isoforms. However, the current landscape lacks a specialized database focusing on alternative splicing events (ASEs) derived from a large number of ESCC cases. Additionally, most existing AS databases overlook the contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in ESCC molecular mechanisms, predominantly focusing on mRNA-based ASE identification. To address these limitations, we deployed DASES (http://www.hxdsjzx.cn/DASES). Employing a combination of publicly available and in-house ESCC RNA-seq datasets, our extensive analysis of 346 samples, with 93% being paired tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, led to the identification of 257 novel lncRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Leveraging a paired comparison of tumor and adjacent normal tissues, DASES identified 59,094 ASEs that may be associated with ESCC. DASES fills a critical gap by providing comprehensive insights into ASEs in ESCC, encompassing lncRNAs and mRNA, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of ESCC molecular mechanisms and serving as a valuable resource for ESCC research communities.",True,False,4.0,,,dases,16.0,ok,,a database of alternative splicing for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,,spacy,0.0,DASES,True,5.0,True,True,http://www.hxdsjzx.cn/DASES,http://www.hxdsjzx.cn/DASES,True,"...To address these limitations, we deployed DASES (http://www.hxdsjzx.cn/DASES).

Tissue functional gene networks (FGNs) are essential models for mapping complex gene interactions. We present TissueNexus, a database of 49 human tissue/cell line FGNs constructed by integrating heterogeneous genomic data. We adopted an advanced machine learning approach for data integration because Bayesian classifiers, which is the main approach used for constructing existing tissue gene networks, cannot capture the interaction and nonlinearity of genomic features well. A total of 1,341 RNA-seq datasets containing 52,087 samples were integrated for all of these networks. Because the tissue label for RNA-seq data may be annotated with different names or be missing, we performed intensive hand-curation to improve quality. We further developed a user-friendly database for network search, visualization, and functional analysis. We illustrate the application of TissueNexus in prioritizing disease genes.

34850139,CircNet 2.0: an updated database for exploring circular RNA regulatory networks in cancers.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are single-stranded RNA molecules that have individually formed into a covalently closed continuous loop, act as sponges of microRNAs to regulate transcription and translation. CircRNAs are important molecules in the field of cancer diagnosis, as growing evidence suggests that they are closely related to pathological cancer features. Therefore, they have high potential for clinical use as novel cancer biomarkers. In this article, we present our updates to CircNet (version 2.0), into which circRNAs from circAtlas and MiOncoCirc, and novel circRNAs from The Cancer Genome Atlas database have been integrated. In total, 2732 samples from 37 types of cancers were integrated into CircNet 2.0 and analyzed using several of the most reliable circRNA detection algorithms. Furthermore, target miRNAs were predicted from the full-length circRNA sequence using three reliable tools (PITA, miRanda and TargetScan). Additionally, 384 897 experimentally verified miRNA-target interactions from miRTarBase were integrated into our database to facilitate the construction of high-quality circRNA-miRNA-gene regulatory networks. These improvements, along with the user-friendly interactive web interface for data presentation, search, and visualization, showcase the updated CircNet database as a powerful, experimentally validated resource, for providing strong data support in the biomedical fields.

To facilitate cavity detection and property analysis process, we developed a comprehensive web server, CavityPlus in 2018. CavityPlus applies the CAVITY program to detect potential binding sites in a given protein structure. The CavPharmer, CorrSite, and CovCys tools can then be applied to generate receptor-based pharmacophore models, identify potential allosteric sites, or detect druggable cysteine residues for covalent drug design. While CavityPlus has been widely used, the constantly evolving knowledge and methods make it necessary to improve and extend its functions. This study presents a new version of CavityPlus, CavityPlus 2022 through a series of upgrades. We upgraded the CAVITY tool to greatly speed up cavity detection calculation. We optimized the CavPharmer tool for fast speed and more accurate results. We integrated the newly developed CorrSite2.0 into the CavityPlus 2022 web server for its improved performance of allosteric site prediction.

36062570,RMDisease V2.0: an updated database of genetic variants that affect RNA modifications with disease and trait implication.,"Recent advances in epitranscriptomics have unveiled functional associations between RNA modifications (RMs) and multiple human diseases, but distinguishing the functional or disease-related single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the majority of 'silent' variants remains a major challenge. We previously developed the RMDisease database for unveiling the association between genetic variants and RMs concerning human disease pathogenesis. In this work, we present RMDisease v2.0, an updated database with expanded coverage. Using deep learning models and from 873 819 experimentally validated RM sites, we identified a total of 1 366 252 RM-associated variants that may affect (add or remove an RM site) 16 different types of RNA modifications (m6A, m5C, m1A, m5U, Ψ, m6Am, m7G, A-to-I, ac4C, Am, Cm, Um, Gm, hm5C, D and f5C) in 20 organisms (human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, maize, fruit fly, yeast, fission yeast, Arabidopsis, rice, chicken, goat, sheep, pig, cow, rhesus monkey, tomato, chimpanzee, green monkey and SARS-CoV-2). Among them, 14 749 disease- and 2441 trait-associated genetic variants may function via the perturbation of epitranscriptomic markers.

34669946,webTWAS: a resource for disease candidate susceptibility genes identified by transcriptome-wide association study.,"The development of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has enabled researchers to better identify and interpret causal genes in many diseases. However, there are currently no resources providing a comprehensive listing of gene-disease associations discovered by TWAS from published GWAS summary statistics. TWAS analyses are also difficult to conduct due to the complexity of TWAS software pipelines. To address these issues, we introduce a new resource called webTWAS, which integrates a database of the most comprehensive disease GWAS datasets currently available with credible sets of potential causal genes identified by multiple TWAS software packages. Specifically, a total of 235 064 gene-diseases associations for a wide range of human diseases are prioritized from 1298 high-quality downloadable European GWAS summary statistics. Associations are calculated with seven different statistical models based on three popular and representative TWAS software packages. Users can explore associations at the gene or disease level, and easily search for related studies or diseases using the MeSH disease tree. Since the effects of diseases are highly tissue-specific, webTWAS applies tissue-specific enrichment analysis to identify significant tissues.

The degree of protein ubiquitination is tightly determined by the delicate balance between specific ubiquitin ligase (E3)-mediated ubiquitination and deubiquitinase-mediated deubiquitination. In 2017, we developed UbiBrowser 1.0, which is an integrated database for predicted human proteome-wide E3-substrate interactions. Here, to meet the urgent requirement of proteome-wide E3/deubiquitinase-substrate interactions (ESIs/DSIs) in multiple organisms, we updated UbiBrowser to version 2.0 (http://ubibrowser.ncpsb.org.cn). Using an improved protocol, we collected 4068/967 known ESIs/DSIs by manual curation, and we predicted about 2.2 million highly confident ESIs/DSIs in 39 organisms, with >210-fold increase in total data volume. In addition, we made several new features in the updated version: (i) it allows exploring proteins' upstream E3 ligases and deubiquitinases simultaneously; (ii) it has significantly increased species coverage; (iii) it presents a uniform confidence scoring system to rank predicted ESIs/DSIs. To facilitate the usage of UbiBrowser 2.0, we also redesigned the web interface for exploring these known and predicted ESIs/DSIs, and added functions of 'Browse', 'Download' and 'Application Programming Interface'.

36930969,CycPeptMPDB: A Comprehensive Database of Membrane Permeability of Cyclic Peptides.,"Recently, cyclic peptides have been considered breakthrough drugs because they can interact with ""undruggable"" targets such as intracellular protein-protein interactions. Membrane permeability is an essential indicator of oral bioavailability and intracellular targeting, and the development of membrane-permeable peptides is a bottleneck in cyclic peptide drug discovery. Although many experimental data on membrane permeability of cyclic peptides have been reported, a comprehensive database is not yet available. A comprehensive membrane permeability database is essential for developing computational methods for cyclic peptide drug design. In this study, we constructed CycPeptMPDB, the first web-accessible database of cyclic peptide membrane permeability. We collected information on a total of 7334 cyclic peptides, including the structure and experimentally measured membrane permeability, from 45 published papers and 2 patents from pharmaceutical companies. To unambiguously represent cyclic peptides larger than small molecules, we used the hierarchical editing language for macromolecules notation to generate a uniform sequence representation of peptides. In addition to data storage, CycPeptMPDB provides several supporting functions such as online data visualization, data analysis, and downloading.

Recently, high-throughput sequencing approaches for G4 detection have provided a large amount of experimentally identified G4 data that reveal genome-wide G4 landscapes and enable the development of new methods for predicting potential G4s from sequences. Although several existing databases provide G4 experimental data and relevant biological information from different perspectives, there is no dedicated database to collect and analyze DNA G4 experimental data genome-widely. Here, we constructed G4Bank, a database of experimentally identified DNA G-quadruplex sequences. A total of 6,915,983 DNA G4s were collected from 13 organisms, and state-of-the-art prediction methods were performed to filter and analyze the G4 data.

35669450,HPMPdb: A machine learning-ready database of protein molecular phenotypes associated to human missense variants.,"Current human Single Amino acid Variants (SAVs) databases provide a link between a SAVs and their effect on the carrier individual phenotype, often dividing them into Deleterious/Neutral variants. This is a very coarse-grained description of the genotype-to-phenotype relationship because it relies on un-realistic assumptions such as the perfect Mendelian behavior of each SAV and considers only dichotomic phenotypes. Moreover, the link between the effect of a SAV on a protein (its molecular phenotype) and the individual phenotype is often very complex, because multiple level of biological abstraction connect the protein and individual level phenotypes. Here we present HPMPdb, a manually curated database containing human SAVs associated with the detailed description of the molecular phenotype they cause on the affected proteins. With particular regards to machine learning (ML), this database can be used to let researchers go beyond the existing Deleterious/Neutral prediction paradigm, allowing them to build molecular phenotype predictors instead. Our class labels describe in a succinct way the effects that each SAV has on 15 protein molecular phenotypes, such as protein-protein interaction, small molecules binding, function, post-translational modifications (PTMs), sub-cellular localization, mimetic PTM, folding and protein expression.

37275273,CrypticProteinDB: an integrated database of proteome and immunopeptidome derived non-canonical cancer proteins.,"Translated non-canonical proteins derived from noncoding regions or alternative open reading frames (ORFs) can contribute to critical and diverse cellular processes. In the context of cancer, they also represent an under-appreciated source of targets for cancer immunotherapy through their tumor-enriched expression or by harboring somatic mutations that produce neoantigens. Here, we introduce the largest integration and proteogenomic analysis of novel peptides to assess the prevalence of non-canonical ORFs (ncORFs) in more than 900 patient proteomes and 26 immunopeptidome datasets across 14 cancer types. The integrative proteogenomic analysis of whole-cell proteomes and immunopeptidomes revealed peptide support for a nonredundant set of 9760 upstream, downstream, and out-of-frame ncORFs in protein coding genes and 12811 in noncoding RNAs. Notably, 6486 ncORFs were derived from differentially expressed genes and 340 were ubiquitously translated across eight or more cancers. The analysis also led to the discovery of thirty-four epitopes and eight neoantigens from non-canonical proteins in two cohorts as novel cancer immunotargets. Collectively, our analysis integrated both bottom-up proteogenomic and targeted peptide validation to illustrate the prevalence of translated non-canonical proteins in cancer and to provide a resource for the prioritization of novel proteins supported by proteomic, immunopeptidomic, genomic and transcriptomic data, available at https://www.maherlab.com/crypticproteindb.",True,False,4.5,,crypticproteindb,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,CrypticProteinDB,True,6.0,True,True,https://www.maherlab.com/crypticproteindb | http://www.maherlab.com/crypticproteindb,https://www.maherlab.com/crypticproteindb,True,"...ic, genomic and transcriptomic data, available at https://www.maherlab.com/crypticproteindb.",1

These compounds have applications in medicine, biotechnology and agriculture. Their production is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we present the BGC Atlas (https://bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de), a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We analyzed over 35 000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly 1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides are the most abundant compound class, with most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity.

In light of the rapid advancement of gene editing technologies over the past decade, a dramatically increased number of gene-edited animals have been generated. Genome editing at off-target sites can, however, introduce genomic variations, potentially leading to unintended functional consequences in these animals. So, there is an urgent need to systematically collect and collate these variations in gene-edited animals to aid data mining and integrative in-depth analyses. However, existing databases are currently insufficient to meet this need. Here, we present the Variation Database of Gene-Edited animals (VDGE, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/vdge), the first open-access repository to present genomic variations and annotations in gene-edited animals, with a particular focus on larger animals such as monkeys.

These effects have been studied on very limited and small datasets while, ideally, a large dataset of binding affinity changes due to binding site single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is needed for evaluation. However, to the best of our knowledge, such a dataset does not exist. Thus, a reference dataset of ligands binding affinities to proteins with all their reported binding sites' variants was constructed using a molecular docking approach. Having a large database of protein-ligand complexes covering a wide range of binding pocket mutations and a large small molecules' landscape is of great importance for several types of studies. For example, developing machine learning algorithms to predict protein-ligand affinity or a SNP effect on it requires an extensive amount of data. In this work, we present PSnpBind: A large database of 0.6 million mutated binding site protein-ligand complexes constructed using a multithreaded virtual screening workflow.

36587232,TCMSID: a simplified integrated database for drug discovery from traditional chinese medicine.,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases for millennia. In the modernization process of TCM, TCM ingredient databases are playing more and more important roles. However, most of the existing TCM ingredient databases do not provide simplification function for extracting key ingredients in each herb or formula, which hinders the research on the mechanism of actions of the ingredients in TCM databases. The lack of quality control and standardization of the data in most of these existing databases is also a prominent disadvantage. Therefore, we developed a Traditional Chinese Medicine Simplified Integrated Database (TCMSID) with high storage, high quality and standardization. The database includes 499 herbs registered in the Chinese pharmacopeia with 20,015 ingredients, 3270 targets as well as corresponding detailed information. TCMSID is not only a database of herbal ingredients, but also a TCM simplification platform. Key ingredients from TCM herbs are available to be screened out and regarded as representatives to explore the mechanism of TCM herbs by implementing multi-tool target prediction and multilevel network construction. TCMSID provides abundant data sources and analysis platforms for TCM simplification and drug discovery, which is expected to promote modernization and internationalization of TCM and enhance its international status in the future.

Recently, the emergence and development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have provided an unprecedented ability to systematically decipher the cellular heterogeneity and spatial locations of the nervous system from multiple unbiased aspects. However, efficiently integrating, presenting and analyzing massive multiomic data remains a huge challenge. Here, we manually collected and comprehensively analyzed high-quality scRNA-seq and ST data from the nervous system, covering 10 679 684 cells. In addition, multi-omic datasets from more than 900 species were included for extensive data mining from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, over 100 neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome) were systematically analyzed for high-throughput screening of putative biomarkers. Differential expression patterns across developmental time points, cell types and ST spots were discerned and subsequently subjected to extensive interpretation.

Therefore, it has become clear that the analysis of post-translational modifications of proteins, including glycosylation, is important to accurately understand the functions of each protein molecule and the interactions among them. In order to conduct large-scale analyses more efficiently, it is essential to promote the accumulation, sharing, and reuse of experimental and analytical data in accordance with the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Re-usability) data principles. However, a FAIR data repository for storing and sharing glycoconjugate information, including glycopeptides and glycoproteins, in a standardized format did not exist. Therefore, we have developed GlyComb (https://glycomb.glycosmos.org) as a new standardized data repository for glycoconjugate data. Currently, GlyComb can assign a unique identifier to a set of glycosylation information associated with a specific peptide sequence or UniProt ID. By standardizing glycoconjugate data via GlyComb identifiers and coordinating with existing web resources such as GlyTouCan and GlycoPOST, a comprehensive system for data submission and data sharing among researchers can be established. Here we introduce how GlyComb is able to integrate the variety of glycoconjugate data already registered in existing data repositories to obtain a better understanding of the available glycopeptides and glycoproteins, and their glycosylation patterns.

The heightened focus on autoinhibited proteins stems from their implication in human diseases, positioning them as potential causal factors or therapeutic targets. However, the absence of a comprehensive knowledgebase impedes a thorough understanding of their roles and applications in drug discovery. Addressing this gap, we introduce Autoinhibited Protein Database (AiPD), a curated database standardizing information on autoinhibited proteins. AiPD encompasses details on autoinhibitory domains (AIDs), their targets, regulatory mechanisms, experimental validation methods, and implications in diseases, including associated mutations and post-translational modifications.

The incidence of ESDs has increased in recent years, often accompanying other chronic diseases, and can lead to disability. A growing body of research suggests that lncRNA plays an important role in the progression and metastasis of ESDs. However, there are no resources focused on collecting and integrating the latest and experimentally supported lncRNA-ESD associations. Hence, we developed an ENCD database that consists of 1379 associations between 35 ESDs and 501 lncRNAs in 12 human tissues curated from literature. By using ENCD, users can explore the genetic data for diseases corresponding to the body parts of interest as well as study the lncRNA regulating mechanism for ESDs. ENCD also provides a flexible tool to visualize a disease- or gene-centric regulatory network.

40257905,Localizatome: a database for stress-dependent subcellular localization changes in proteins.,"Understanding protein subcellular localization and its dynamic changes is crucial for elucidating cellular function and disease mechanisms, particularly under stress conditions, where protein localization changes can modulate cellular responses. Currently available databases provide insights into protein localization under steady-state conditions; however, stress-related dynamic localization changes remain poorly understood. Here, we present the Localizatome, a comprehensive database that captures stress-induced protein localization dynamics in living cells. Using an original high-throughput microscopy system and machine learning algorithms, we analysed the localization patterns of 10 287 fluorescent protein-fused human proteins in HeLa cells before and after exposure to oxidative stress. Our analysis revealed that 1910 proteins exhibited oxidative stress-dependent localization changes, particularly forming distinct foci. Among them, there were stress granule assembly factors and autophagy-related proteins, as well as components of various signalling pathways. Subsequent characterization identified some specific amino acid motifs and intrinsically disordered regions associated with stress-induced protein redistribution. The Localizatome provides open access to these data through a web-based interface, supporting a wide range of studies on cellular stress response and disease mechanisms.

38242684,DAPredict: a database for drug action phenotype prediction.,"The phenotypes of drug action, including therapeutic actions and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), are important indicators for evaluating the druggability of new drugs and repositioning the approved drugs. Here, we provide a user-friendly database, DAPredict (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/DAPredict), in which our novel original drug action phenotypes prediction algorithm (Yang,J., Zhang,D., Liu,L. et al. (2021) Computational drug repositioning based on the relationships between substructure-indication. Brief. Bioinformatics, 22, bbaa348) was embedded. Our algorithm integrates characteristics of chemical genomics and pharmacogenomics, breaking through the limitations that traditional drug development process based on phenotype cannot analyze the mechanism of drug action. Predicting phenotypes of drug action based on the local active structures of drugs and proteins can achieve more innovative drug discovery across drug categories and simultaneously evaluate drug efficacy and safety, rather than traditional one-by-one evaluation. DAPredict contains 305 981 predicted relationships between 1748 approved drugs and 454 ADRs, 83 117 predicted relationships between 1478 approved drugs and 178 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemicals (ATC). More importantly, DAPredict provides an online prediction tool, which researchers can use to predict the action phenotypic spectrum of more than 110 000 000 compounds (including about 168 000 natural products) and corresponding proteins to analyze their potential effect mechanisms. DAPredict can also help researchers obtain the phenotype-corresponding active structures for structural optimization of new drug candidates, making it easier to evaluate the druggability of new drug candidates and develop more innovative drugs across drug categories.

38685101,QuanDB: a quantum chemical property database towards enhancing 3D molecular representation learning.,"Previous studies have shown that the three-dimensional (3D) geometric and electronic structure of molecules play a crucial role in determining their key properties and intermolecular interactions. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a quantum chemical (QC) property database containing the most stable 3D geometric conformations and electronic structures of molecules. In this study, a high-quality QC property database, called QuanDB, was developed, which included structurally diverse molecular entities and featured a user-friendly interface. Currently, QuanDB contains 154,610 compounds sourced from public databases and scientific literature, with 10,125 scaffolds. The elemental composition comprises nine elements: H, C, O, N, P, S, F, Cl, and Br. For each molecule, QuanDB provides 53 global and 5 local QC properties and the most stable 3D conformation. These properties are divided into three categories: geometric structure, electronic structure, and thermodynamics. Geometric structure optimization and single point energy calculation at the theoretical level of B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G(d)/SMD/water and B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP/SMD/water, respectively, were applied to ensure highly accurate calculations of QC properties, with the computational cost exceeding 107 core-hours. QuanDB provides high-value geometric and electronic structure information for use in molecular representation models, which are critical for machine-learning-based molecular design, thereby contributing to a comprehensive description of the chemical compound space. As a new high-quality dataset for QC properties, QuanDB is expected to become a benchmark tool for the training and optimization of machine learning models, thus further advancing the development of novel drugs and materials.

36719094,Exploring pharmacological active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine by pharmacotranscriptomic map in ITCM.,"With the emergence of high-throughput technologies, computational screening based on gene expression profiles has become one of the most effective methods for drug discovery. More importantly, profile-based approaches remarkably enhance novel drug-disease pair discovery without relying on drug- or disease-specific prior knowledge, which has been widely used in modern medicine. However, profile-based systematic screening of active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been scarcely performed due to inadequate pharmacotranscriptomic data. Here, we develop the largest-to-date online TCM active ingredients-based pharmacotranscriptomic platform integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) for the effective screening of active ingredients. First, we performed unified high-throughput experiments and constructed the largest data repository of 496 representative active ingredients, which was five times larger than the previous one built by our team. The transcriptome-based multi-scale analysis was also performed to elucidate their mechanism. Then, we developed six state-of-art signature search methods to screen active ingredients and determine the optimal signature size for all methods. Moreover, we integrated them into a screening strategy, TCM-Query, to identify the potential active ingredients for the special disease. In addition, we also comprehensively collected the TCM-related resource by literature mining. Finally, we applied ITCM to an active ingredient bavachinin, and two diseases, including prostate cancer and COVID-19, to demonstrate the power of drug discovery. ITCM was aimed to comprehensively explore the active ingredients of TCM and boost studies of pharmacological action and drug discovery.

40536622,Risk factors for early mortality among patients with gastrointestinal malignancy in the C-CAT database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) is essential for precision medicine, but early mortality remains a concern for patients undergoing CGP. This study aimed to identify risk factors for early mortality and develop a prediction model for gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies on the basis of data from the Japanese C-CAT database.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from 18,657 patients with pancreatic, biliary, colorectal, and upper GI cancers were collected from the C-CAT database and retrospectively analyzed. Early mortality was defined as mortality within 90 days after CGP submission. A prediction model was constructed via weighted scoring of clinical factors, and the model was subsequently validated. Survival analysis was conducted to assess the utility of this model for prognostic stratification.<h4>Results</h4>The early mortality rate was 14.2%. Independent predictors of early mortality included cancer type (pancreatic/biliary), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) ≥2, metastases, disease progression, and male sex. The prediction model stratified patients into low- (6.1%), intermediate- (17.6%), high-risk (39.2%), and very high-risk (75.6%) groups with a moderate level of discrimination (C statistic: 0.70-0.73). Survival analysis revealed that the median survival times after CGP submission for each group were 384.0 days, 199.0 days, 114.0 days, and 48.0 days, respectively.

38587206,RNAhugs web server for customized 3D RNA structure alignment.,"Alignment of 3D molecular structures involves overlaying their sets of atoms in space in such a way as to minimize the distance between the corresponding atoms. The purpose of this procedure is usually to analyze and assess structural similarity on a global (e.g. evaluating predicted 3D models and clustering structures) or a local level (e.g. searching for common substructures). Although the idea of alignment is simple, combinatorial algorithms that implement it require considerable computational resources, even when processing relatively small structures. In this paper, we introduce RNAhugs, a web server for custom and flexible alignment of 3D RNA structures. Using two efficient heuristics, GEOS and GENS, it finds the longest corresponding fragments within 3D structures that may differ in sizes-given in the PDB or PDBx/mmCIF formats-that manage to align with user-specified accuracy (i.e. with an RMSD not exceeding a cutoff value given as an input parameter). A distinctive advantage of the system lies in its ability to process multi-model files and compare the results of 1-25 alignments in a single task.

We developed the BioLiP2 database (https://zhanggroup.org/BioLiP) to extract biologically relevant protein-ligand interactions from the PDB database. BioLiP2 assesses the functional relevance of the ligands by geometric rules and experimental literature validations. The ligand binding information is further enriched with other function annotations, including Enzyme Commission numbers, Gene Ontology terms, catalytic sites, and binding affinities collected from other databases and a manual literature survey. Compared to its predecessor BioLiP, BioLiP2 offers significantly greater coverage of nucleic acid-protein interactions, and interactions involving large complexes that are unavailable in PDB format. BioLiP2 also integrates cutting-edge structural alignment algorithms with state-of-the-art structure prediction techniques, which for the first time enables composite protein structure and sequence-based searching and significantly enhances the usefulness of the database in structure-based function annotations.

Applications that use k-mers include genome assembly and alignment. However, the wider bioinformatic use of these short sequences has challenges related to the massive scale of genomic sequence data. A single human genome assembly has billions of k-mers. As a result, the computational requirements for analyzing k-mer information is enormous, particularly when involving complete genome assemblies. To address these issues, we developed a new indexing data structure based on a hash table tuned for the lookup of short sequence keys. This web application, referred to as KmerKeys, provides performant, rapid query speeds for cloud computation on genome assemblies. We enable fuzzy as well as exact sequence searches of assemblies. To enable robust and speedy performance, the website implements cache-friendly hash tables, memory mapping and massive parallel processing. Our method employs a scalable and efficient data structure that can be used to jointly index and search a large collection of human genome assembly information.

Antiviral proteins, such as interferon, have been used for treating chronic hepatitis C infections for decades. Natural-origin antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins, have also been identified as possessing antiviral activities, including direct antiviral effects and the ability to induce indirect immune responses to viruses. To promote the development of antiviral drugs, we constructed a data repository of antiviral peptides and proteins (DRAVP). The database provides general information, antiviral activity, structure information, physicochemical information, and literature information for peptides and proteins.

Recent evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer. However, despite increasing data and evidence indicating the implication of lncRNAs in breast cancer, no web resource or database exists primarily for lncRNAs associated with only breast cancer. Therefore, we developed a manually curated, comprehensive database, ""BCLncRDB,"" for lncRNAs associated with breast cancer. For this, we collected, processed, and analyzed available data on breast cancer-associated lncRNAs from different sources, including previously published research articles, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Ensembl database; subsequently, these data were hosted at BCLncRDB for public access. Currently, the database contains 5324 unique breast cancer-lncRNA associations and has the following features: (i) a user-friendly, easy-to-use web interface for searching and browsing about lncRNAs of the user's interest, (ii) differentially expressed and methylated lncRNAs, (iii) stage- and subtype-specific lncRNAs, and (iv) drugs, subcellular localization, sequence, and chromosome information of these lncRNAs.

Within these structures, numerous local structural sites depict the details characterizing structure and function. However, searching and analyzing these sites extensively and at scale poses a challenge. We present a new method to search local sites in protein structure databases using residue-defined local 3D micro-environments. We implemented the method in a new tool called MicroMiner and demonstrate the capabilities of residue micro-environment search on the example of structural mutation analysis. Usually, experimental structures for both the wild-type and the mutant are unavailable for comparison. With MicroMiner, we extracted $>255 \times 10^{6}$ amino acid pairs in protein structures from the PDB, exemplifying single mutations' local structural changes for single chains and $>45 \times 10^{6}$ pairs for protein-protein interfaces. We further annotate existing data sets of experimentally measured mutation effects, like $\Delta \Delta G$ measurements, with the extracted structure pairs to combine the mutation effect measurement with the structural change upon mutation.

35654801,CDCDB: A large and continuously updated drug combination database.,"In recent years, due to the complementary action of drug combinations over mono-therapy, the multiple-drugs for multiple-targets paradigm has received increased attention to treat bacterial infections and complex diseases. Although new drug combinations screening has benefited from experimental tests like automated high throughput screening, it is limited due to the large number of possible drug combinations. The task of drug combination screening can be streamlined through computational methods and models. Such models require up-to-date databases; however, existing databases are static and consist of the data collected at the time of their creation. This paper introduces the Continuous Drug Combination Database (CDCDB), a continuously updated drug combination database. The CDCDB includes over 40,795 drug combinations, of which 17,107 are unique combinations consisting of more than 4,129 individual drugs, curated from ClinicalTrials.gov, the FDA Orange Book<sup>®</sup>, and patents.

As a result, extensive genetic variations have been discovered from many populations and germplasms to understand the genetic diversity of soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.). However, assessing the quality of variation is essential because the published variants were collected using different bioinformatic methods and parameters. Furthermore, despite the enhanced genome contiguity and more efficient filling of ""N"" stretches in the new reference genome, there remains a dearth of endeavors to verify the caliber of variations present in it. The primary goal of this research was to discern a dependable set of SNPs that can withstand reconciliation across multiple reference genomes. Additionally, the investigation aimed to reconfirm the variations through the utilization of numerous whole genome sequencing data obtained from publicly available databases.

Herein, we introduce the StoneMod 2.0 database (https://www.stonemod.org), which has been dramatically improved from the previous version by expanding the number of the modulatory proteins in the list (from 32 in the initial version to 17,130 in this updated version). The stone modulatory proteins were recruited from solid experimental evidence (via PubMed) and/or predicted evidence (via UniProtKB, QuickGO, ProRule, STITCH and OxaBIND to retrieve calcium-binding and oxalate-binding proteins). Additionally, StoneMod 2.0 has implemented a scoring system that can be used to determine the likelihood and to classify the potential stone modulatory proteins as either ""solid"" (modulator score ≥ 50) or ""weak"" (modulator score < 50) modulators. Furthermore, the updated version has been designed with more user-friendly interfaces and advanced visualization tools. In addition to the monthly scheduled update, the users can directly submit their experimental evidence online anytime. Therefore, StoneMod 2.0 is a powerful database with prediction scores that will be very useful for many future studies on the stone modulatory proteins.",True,False,4.0,,stonemod,,16.0,ok,,uniprotkb | oxabind,stitch,spacy,0.0,StoneMod,True,5.0,True,True,https://www.stonemod.org | http://www.stonemod.org,https://www.stonemod.org,True,"....

37850638,TheMarker: a comprehensive database of therapeutic biomarkers.,"Distinct from the traditional diagnostic/prognostic biomarker (adopted as the indicator of disease state/process), the therapeutic biomarker (ThMAR) has emerged to be very crucial in the clinical development and clinical practice of all therapies. There are five types of ThMAR that have been found to play indispensable roles in various stages of drug discovery, such as: Pharmacodynamic Biomarker essential for guaranteeing the pharmacological effects of a therapy, Safety Biomarker critical for assessing the extent or likelihood of therapy-induced toxicity, Monitoring Biomarker indispensable for guiding clinical management by serially measuring patients' status, Predictive Biomarker crucial for maximizing the clinical outcome of a therapy for specific individuals, and Surrogate Endpoint fundamental for accelerating the approval of a therapy. However, these data of ThMARs has not been comprehensively described by any of the existing databases. Herein, a database, named 'TheMarker', was therefore constructed to (a) systematically offer all five types of ThMAR used at different stages of drug development, (b) comprehensively describe ThMAR information for the largest number of drugs among available databases, (c) extensively cover the widest disease classes by not just focusing on anticancer therapies.

37850641,scTEA-db: a comprehensive database of novel terminal exon isoforms identified from human single cell transcriptomes.,"The usage of alternative terminal exons results in messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms that differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and often also in their protein-coding sequences. Alternative 3' UTRs contain different sets of cis-regulatory elements known to regulate mRNA stability, translation and localization, all of which are vital to cell identity and function. In previous work, we revealed that ∼25 percent of the experimentally observed RNA 3' ends are located within regions currently annotated as intronic, indicating that many 3' end isoforms remain to be uncovered. Also, the inclusion of not yet annotated terminal exons is more tissue specific compared to the already annotated ones. Here, we present the single cell-based Terminal Exon Annotation database (scTEA-db, www.scTEA-db.org) that provides the community with 12 063 so far not yet annotated terminal exons and associated transcript isoforms identified by analysing 53 069 publicly available single cell transcriptomes. Our scTEA-db web portal offers an array of features to find and explore novel terminal exons belonging to 5538 human genes, 110 of which are known cancer drivers.

In this release, we have enhanced the platform, expanding our initial collection to over 700 position weight matrices (PWM), all of which include DNA methylation profiles. One of the key advancements in this release is the segregation of TF-binding motifs based on their cofactors and DNA methylation status. We have previously demonstrated that gene ontology (GO) enriched terms associated with TF target genes may differ based on their association with alternative cofactors and DNA methylation status. MethMotif provides precomputed GO annotations for each human TF of interest, as well as for TF-co-TF complexes, enabling a comprehensive analysis of TF functions in the context of their co-factors. Additionally, MethMotif has been updated to encompass data for two new species, Mus musculus and Arabidopsis thaliana, widening its applicability to a broader community.

39226898,SpliceVarDB: A comprehensive database of experimentally validated human splicing variants.,"Variants that alter gene splicing are estimated to comprise up to a third of all disease-causing variants, yet they are hard to predict from DNA sequencing data alone. To overcome this, many groups are incorporating RNA-based analyses, which are resource intensive, particularly for diagnostic laboratories. There are thousands of functionally validated variants that induce mis-splicing; however, this information is not consolidated, and they are under-represented in ClinVar, which presents a barrier to variant interpretation and can result in duplication of validation efforts. To address this issue, we developed SpliceVarDB, an online database consolidating over 50,000 variants assayed for their effects on splicing in over 8,000 human genes. We evaluated over 500 published data sources and established a spliceogenicity scale to standardize, harmonize, and consolidate variant validation data generated by a range of experimental protocols. According to the strength of their supporting evidence, variants were classified as ""splice-altering"" (∼25%), ""not splice-altering"" (∼25%), and ""low-frequency splice-altering"" (∼50%), which correspond to weak or indeterminate evidence of spliceogenicity. Importantly, 55% of the splice-altering variants in SpliceVarDB are outside the canonical splice sites (5.6% are deep intronic). These variants can support the variant curation diagnostic pathway and can be used to provide the high-quality data necessary to develop more accurate in silico splicing predictors. The variants are accessible through an online platform, SpliceVarDB, with additional features for visualization, variant information, in silico predictions, and validation metrics.

39341795,SCancerRNA: Expression at the Single-cell Level and Interaction Resource of Non-coding RNA Biomarkers for Cancers.,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in multiple biological processes associated with cancers as tumor suppressors or oncogenic drivers. Due to their high stability in plasma, urine, and many other fluids, ncRNAs have the potential to serve as key biomarkers for early diagnosis and screening of cancers. During cancer progression, tumor heterogeneity plays a crucial role, and it is particularly important to understand the gene expression patterns of individual cells. With the development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, uncovering gene expression in different cell types for human cancers has become feasible by profiling transcriptomes at the cellular level. However, a well-organized and comprehensive online resource that provides access to the expression of genes corresponding to ncRNA biomarkers in different cell types at the single-cell level is not available yet. Therefore, we developed the SCancerRNA database to summarize experimentally supported data on long ncRNA, microRNA, PIWI-interacting RNA, small nucleolar RNA, and circular RNA biomarkers, as well as data on their differential expression at the cellular level. Furthermore, we collected biological functions and clinical applications of biomarkers to facilitate the application of ncRNA biomarkers to cancer diagnosis, as well as the monitoring of progression and targeted therapies.

The rapid development of omics studies on horticultural plants has resulted in large volumes of valuable growth- and development-related data. Genes that are essential for growth and development are highly conserved in evolution. Cross-species data mining reduces the impact of species heterogeneity and has been extensively used for conserved gene identification. Owing to the lack of a comprehensive database for cross-species data mining using multi-omics data from all horticultural plant species, the current resources in this field are far from satisfactory.

Increasing evidence supports the critical role of lncRNAs in the emergence, regulation, and progression of various viral infections including influenza, hepatitis, coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Hence, the identification of signature lncRNAs would facilitate focused analysis of their functional roles accounting for their targets and regulatory mechanisms associated with infections. Towards this, we compiled 2803 lncRNAs identified to be modulated by 33 viral strains in various mammalian cell types and are provided through the resource named VirhostlncR (http://ciods.in/VirhostlncR/). The information on each of the viral strains, their multiplicity of infection, duration of infection, host cell name and cell types, fold change of lncRNA expression, and their specific identification methods are integrated into VirhostlncR.

37867380,"Investigation of pathogenic germline variants in gastric cancer and development of ""GasCanBase"" database.","<h4>Background</h4>Gastric cancer, which is also known as stomach cancer, can be influenced by both germline and somatic mutations. Non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in germline have long been reported to play a pivotal role in cancer progression.<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of this study is to examine the nsSNP in GC-associated genes. The study also aims to develop a database with extensive information regarding the nsSNPs in the GC-associated genes and their impacts.<h4>Methods and results</h4>A total of 34,588 nsSNPs from 1,493,460 SNPs of the 40 genes were extracted from the available SNP database. Drug binding and energy minimization were examined by molecular docking and YASARA. To validate the existence of the germline CDH1 gene mutation (rs34466743) in the isolated blood DNA of gastric cancer (GC) patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing were performed. According to the results of the gene network analysis, 17 genes may interact with other types of cancer. A total of 11,363 nsSNPs were detected within the 40 GC genes. Among these, 474 nsSNPs were predicted to be damaging and 40 to be the most damaging. The SNPs in domain regions were thought to be strong candidates that alter protein functions. Our findings proposed that most of the selected nsSNPs were within the domains or motif regions. Free Energy Deviation calculation of protein structure pointed toward noteworthy changes in the structure of each protein that can demolish its natural function. Subsequently, drug binding confirmed the structural variation and the ineffectiveness of the drug against the mutant model in individuals with these germline variants. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of the rs34466743 germline variant from the CDH1 gene confirmed the strength and robustness of the pipeline that could expand the somatic alteration for causing cancer. In addition, a comprehensive gastric cancer polymorphism database named ""GasCanBase"" was developed to make data available to researchers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings of this study and the ""GasCanBase"" database may greatly contribute to our understanding of molecular epidemiology and the development of precise therapeutics for gastric cancer.

35754095,DoPI: The Database of Pollinator Interactions.,"Despite the importance of pollinating insects to natural environments and agriculture, there have been few attempts to unite the existing plant-pollinator interaction datasets into a single depository using a common format. Accordingly, we have created one of the world's first online, open-access, and searchable pollinator-plant interaction databases. DoPI (The Database of Pollinator Interactions) was built from a systematic review of the scientific literature and unpublished datasets requested from researchers and organizations. We collated records of interactions between British plant and insect flower-visitor species (or genera), together with associated metadata (date, location, habitat, source publication) when available. The dataset currently (December 2021) contains 101,539 records, detailing over 320,000 interactions. The number of interactions (i.e., the number of times a pairwise species interaction was recorded per occasion) varies considerably among records, averaging 3.6. These include records from 1888 pollinator species and 1241 plant species, totaling >17,000 pairwise species interactions. By combining a large volume of information in a single repository, DoPI can be used to answer fundamental ecological questions on the dynamics of pollination interactions in space and time, as well as applied questions in conservation practice. We hope this dynamic database will be a useful tool not only for researchers, but also for conservationists, funding agencies, governmental departments, beekeepers, agronomists, and gardeners.

Accordingly, 520,194 intact LTR-RTs were discovered, including 29,462 autonomous and 490,732 nonautonomous LTR-RTs. The autonomous LTR-RTs included 10,286 <i>Gypsy</i> and 19,176 <i>Copia</i>, while the nonautonomous were divided into 224,906 <i>Gypsy</i>, 218,414 <i>Copia</i>, 1,768 BARE-2, 3,147 TR-GAG and 4,2497 unknown. Analysis of the identified LTR-RTs located within genes showed that a total of 36,236 LTR-RTs were LTR-RT-gene chimeras and 11,619 LTR-RTs were within pseudo-genes. In addition, 50,026 genes are within 1 kbp of LTR-RTs, and 250,587 had a distance of 1 to 10 kbp from LTR-RTs. PlantLTRdb allows researchers to search, visualize, BLAST and analyze plant LTR-RTs. PlantLTRdb can contribute to the understanding of structural variations, genome organization, functional genomics, and the development of LTR-RT target markers for molecular plant breeding.

In plants, Snf2 is involved in growth, development, as well as stress resistance. However, only a very limited number of experimentally validated Snf2 have been identified and reported, while the majority remaining undiscovered in most species . In this study, we predicted 3135 Snf2 proteins and 8398 chromatin remodeling complex (CRC) subunits in diverse plant species, and constructed the Plant Chromatin Remodeling Factors Database (PlantCHRs, http://www.functionalgenomics.cn/PlantCHRs/), which provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to access information about plant CHRs. We also developed an online tool capable of predicting CHRs and CRC subunits. Moreover, we investigated the distribution of Snf2 proteins in different species and observed a significant increase in the number of Snf2 proteins and the diversity of the Snf2 subfamily during the evolution, highlighting their evolutionary importance. By analyzing the expression patterns of the Snf2 genes in different tissues of maize and <i>Arabidopsis</i>, we found that the Snf2 proteins may show some conservation across different species in regulating plant growth and development.

37311148,GeniePool: genomic database with corresponding annotated samples based on a cloud data lake architecture.,"In recent years, there are a huge influx of genomic data and a growing need for its phenotypic correlations, yet existing genomic databases do not allow easy storage and accessibility to the combined phenotypic-genotypic information. Freely accessible allele frequency (AF) databases, such as gnomAD, are crucial for evaluating variants but lack correlated phenotype data. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accumulates hundreds of thousands of next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples tagged by their submitters and various attributes. However, samples are stored in large raw format files, inaccessible for a common user. To make thousands of NGS samples and their corresponding additional attributes easily available to clinicians and researchers, we generated a pipeline that continuously downloads raw human NGS data uploaded to SRA using SRAtoolkit and preprocesses them using GATK pipeline. Data are then stored efficiently in a cloud data lake and can be accessed via a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API) and a user-friendly website. We thus generated GeniePool, a simple and intuitive web service and API for querying NGS data from SRA with direct access to information related to each sample and related studies, providing significant advantages over existing databases for both clinical and research usages. Utilizing data lake infrastructure, we were able to generate a multi-purpose tool that can serve many clinical and research use cases.

37311149,Neodb: a comprehensive neoantigen database and discovery platform for cancer immunotherapy.,"Neoantigens derived from somatic deoxyribonucleic acid alterations are ideal cancer-specific targets. However, integrated platform for neoantigen discovery is urgently needed. Recently, many scattered experimental evidences suggest that some neoantigens are immunogenic, and comprehensive collection of these experimentally validated neoantigens is still lacking. Here, we have integrated the commonly used tools in the current neoantigen discovery process to form a comprehensive web-based analysis platform. To identify experimental evidences supporting the immunogenicity of neoantigens, we performed comprehensive literature search and constructed the database. The collection of public neoantigens was obtained by using comprehensive features to filter the potential neoantigens from recurrent driver mutations. Importantly, we constructed a graph neural network (GNN) model (Immuno-GNN) using an attention mechanism to consider the spatial interactions between human leukocyte antigen and antigenic peptides for neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. The new easy-to-use R/Shiny web-based neoantigen database and discovery platform, Neodb, contains currently the largest number of experimentally validated neoantigens. In addition to validated neoantigen, Neodb also includes three additional modules for facilitating neoantigen prediction and analysis, including 'Tools' module (comprehensive neoantigen prediction tools); 'Driver-Neo' module (collection of public neoantigens derived from recurrent mutations) and 'Immuno-GNN' module (a novel immunogenicity prediction tool based on a GNN). Immuno-GNN shows improved performance compared with known methods and also represents the first application of GNN model in neoantigen immunogenicity prediction.

However, neutralization data are generated using different approaches and are scattered across different publications making it difficult for these data to be located and synthesized. The Stanford Coronavirus Resistance Database (CoV-RDB; https://covdb.stanford.edu) is designed to house comprehensively curated published data on the neutralizing susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants and spike mutations to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), convalescent plasma (CP), and vaccinee plasma (VP). As of December 31, 2021, CoV-RDB encompassed 257 publications including 91 (35%) containing 9,070 neutralizing mAb susceptibility results, 131 (51%) containing 16,773 neutralizing CP susceptibility results, and 178 (69%) containing 33,540 neutralizing VP results. The database also records which spike mutations are selected during in vitro passage of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of mAbs and which emerge in persons receiving mAbs as treatment.

In the last few decades, the number of publications documenting POP-degrading microbes, enzymes, and experimental data sets has continuously increased, necessitating the development of a dedicated web resource that catalogs consolidated information on POP-degrading microbes and tools to facilitate integrative analysis of POP degradation data sets. To address this knowledge gap, we developed the Microbial Biodegradation of Persistent Organic Pollutants Database (mibPOPdb) by accumulating microbial POP degradation information from the public domain and manually curating published scientific literature. Currently, in mibPOPdb, there are 9215 microbial strain entries, including 184 gene (sub)families, 100 enzymes, 48 biodegradation pathways, and 593 intermediate compounds identified in POP-biodegradation processes, and information on 32 toxic compounds listed under the Stockholm Convention environmental treaty. Besides the standard database functionalities, which include data searching, browsing, and retrieval of database entries, we provide a suite of bioinformatics services to facilitate comparative analysis of users' own data sets against mibPOPdb entries.

However, changes in blood RNA and their clinical relevance remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an RNA profile based on 1468 blood samples from both human and mouse studies, which include bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microRNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq data. We developed a comprehensive analysis pipeline that conducted over 11 million comparisons and correlations to identify more than 20,000 blood features. With these findings, we established a blood RNA database related to Alzheimer's disease, RNAs in Blood of AD (RBAD, http://www.bioinform.cn/RBAD/). Using RBAD, we initially validated well-established Alzheimer's disease-related pathways, including olfactory transduction. We then observed a decrease in both the proportion and functionality of erythroid cells, likely attributed to their elevated CD45 levels and interactions with GZMK+CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, we identified 449 blood RNAs linked to patients' overall survival, along with two mRNAs (H4C3 and CTU1) associated with cognitive decline.

Antibiotic contamination poses a significant risk to ecosystems and human health by contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), known for its high sensitivity and specificity, is a powerful tool for antibiotic identification. However, its broader application is constrained by the lack of a large-scale antibiotic spectral database crucial for environmental and clinical use. To address this need, we systematically collected 12,800 SERS spectra for 200 environmentally relevant antibiotics and developed an open-access, web-based database at http://sers.test.bniu.net/. We compared six machine learning algorithms with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which achieved the highest accuracy at 98.94%, making it the preferred database model. For external validation, CNN demonstrated an accuracy of 82.8%, underscoring its reliability and practicality for real-world applications. The SERS database and CNN prediction model represent a novel resource for environmental monitoring, offering significant advantages in terms of accessibility, speed, and scalability.

Dense granule proteins (GRAs), specific to the Apicomplexa, participate in the maintenance of intracellular parasitism of host cells. GRAs have better immunogenicity and they can be emerged as important players in vaccine development. Although studies on GRAs have increased gradually in recent years, due to incompleteness and complexity of data collection, biologists have difficulty in the comprehensive utilization of information. Thus, there is a desperate need of user-friendly resource to integrate with existing GRAs. In this paper, we developed the Dense Granule Protein Database (DGPD), the first knowledge database dedicated to the integration and analysis of typical GRAs properties. The current version of DGPD includes annotated GRAs metadata of 245 samples derived from multiple web repositories and literature mining, involving five species that cause common diseases (Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, Hammondia hammondi, Neospora caninum and Cystoisospora suis). We explored the baseline characteristics of GRAs and found that the number of introns and transmembrane domains in GRAs are markedly different from those of non-GRAs.

36394420,TRustDB: A comprehensive bioinformatics resource for understanding the complete Wheat-Stem rust host-pathogen interactome.,"The increasing infectious diseases in wheat immensely reduce crop yield and quality, thus affecting global wheat production. The evolution in phytopathogens hinders the understanding of the disease infection mechanisms. TRustDB is an open-access, comprehensive database that is specifically focused on the disease stem rust (also known as black rust) in Triticum aestivum, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis (Pgt), strains 'Ug99' and '21-0'. The database aims at a broader focus of providing the researchers with comprehensive tools to predict the protein-protein interactions and avail the functional annotations of the proteins involved in the interactions that cause the disease. The network of the predicted interactome can also be visualized on the browser. Various modules for the functional annotations of the host and pathogen proteins such as subcellular localization, functional domains, gene ontology annotations, pathogen orthologs and effector proteins have been implemented. The host proteins that serve as transcription factors, along with the respective Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways are also available, which further enhance the understanding of the disease infection mechanisms and the defense responses of the host. The database is also linked with several other databases such as InterPro, KEGG pathways, Ensembl and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

35411388,PASS2.7: a database containing structure-based sequence alignments and associated features of protein domain superfamilies from SCOPe.,"Sequence alignments are models that capture the structural, functional and evolutionary relationships between proteins. Structure-guided sequence alignments are helpful in the case of distantly related proteins with poor sequence identity, thus rendering routine sequence alignment methods ineffective. Protein Alignment organized as Structural Superfamilies or PASS2 database provides such sequence alignments of protein domains within a superfamily as per the Structural Classification of Proteins extended (SCOPe) database. The current update of PASS2 (i.e. PASS2.7) is following the latest release of SCOPe (2.07) and we provide data for 14 323 protein domains that are <40% identical and are organized into 2024 superfamilies. Several useful features derived from the alignments, such as conserved secondary structural motifs, HMMs and residues conserved across the superfamily, are also reported. Protein domains that are deviant from the rest of the members of a superfamily may compromise the quality of the alignment, and we found this to be the case in ∼7% of the total superfamilies we considered. To improve the alignment by objectively identifying such 'outliers', in this update, we have used a k-means-based unsupervised machine learning method for clustering superfamily members, where features provided were length of domains aligned, Cα-RMSD derived from the rigid-body superposition of all members and gaps contributed to the alignment by each domain. In a few cases, we have split the superfamily as per the clusters predicted and provided complete data for each cluster. A new feature included in this update is absolutely conserved interactions (ACIs) between residue backbones and side chains, which are obtained by aligning protein structure networks using structure-guided sequence alignments of superfamilies. ACIs provide valuable information about functionally important residues and the structure-function relationships of proteins. The ACIs and the corresponding conserved networks for backbone and sidechain have been marked on the superimposed structure separately.<h4>Database url</h4>The updated version of the PASS2 database is available at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/.",True,False,4.0,,,pass2.7 | scope | pass2,16.0,conflict,,a database containing structure-based sequence alignments and associated features of protein domain superfamilies from | protein alignment organized as structural superfamilies or | structural classification of proteins,,spacy,0.0,PASS2.,True,5.0,False,False,http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/,http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/,True,...ted version of the PASS2 database is available at http://caps.ncbs.res.in/pass2/.,1

Its main purposes are to increase the reusability and accessibility of human gut metagenomic data, and enable cross-project and phenotype comparisons. To achieve these goals, we performed manual curation on the meta-data and organized the datasets in a phenotype-centric manner. GMrepo v2 contains 353 projects and 71,642 runs/samples, which are significantly increased from the previous version. Among these runs/samples, 45,111 and 26,531 were obtained by 16S rRNA amplicon and whole-genome metagenomics sequencing, respectively. We also increased the number of phenotypes from 92 to 133. In addition, we introduced disease-marker identification and cross-project/phenotype comparison. We first identified disease markers between two phenotypes (e.g. health versus diseases) on a per-project basis for selected projects. We then compared the identified markers for each phenotype pair across datasets to facilitate the identification of consistent microbial markers across datasets. Finally, we provided a marker-centric view to allow users to check if a marker has different trends in different diseases. So far, GMrepo includes 592 marker taxa (350 species and 242 genera) for 47 phenotype pairs, identified from 83 selected projects.

34788852,dbPTM in 2022: an updated database for exploring regulatory networks and functional associations of protein post-translational modifications.,"Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play an important role in different cellular processes. In view of the importance of PTMs in cellular functions and the massive data accumulated by the rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, this paper presents an update of dbPTM with over 2 777 000 PTM substrate sites obtained from existing databases and manual curation of literature, of which more than 2 235 000 entries are experimentally verified. This update has manually curated over 42 new modification types that were not included in the previous version. Due to the increasing number of studies on the mechanism of PTMs in the past few years, a great deal of upstream regulatory proteins of PTM substrate sites have been revealed. The updated dbPTM thus collates regulatory information from databases and literature, and merges them into a protein-protein interaction network. To enhance the understanding of the association between PTMs and molecular functions/cellular processes, the functional annotations of PTMs are curated and integrated into the database. In addition, the existing PTM-related resources, including annotation databases and prediction tools are also renewed.

36968016,ESCCdb: A comprehensive database and key regulator exploring platform based on cross dataset comparisons for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Esophageal cancer is the seventh most prevalent and the sixth most lethal cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the major esophageal cancer subtypes that accounts for 87 % of the total cases. However, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present an integrated database for ESCC called ESCCdb, which includes a total of 56 datasets and published studies from the GEO, Xena or SRA databases and related publications. It helps users to explore a particular gene with multiple graphical and interactive views with one click. The results comprise expression changes across 20 datasets, copy number alterations in 11 datasets, somatic mutations from 12 papers, related drugs derived from DGIdb, related pathways, and gene correlations. ESCCdb enables directly cross-dataset comparison of a gene's mutations, expressions and copy number changes in multiple datasets. This allows users to easily assess the alterations in ESCC. Furthermore, survival analysis, drug-gene relationships, and results from whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screening can help users determine the clinical relevance, derive functional inferences, and identify potential drugs. Notably, ESCCdb also enables the exploration of the correlation structure and identification of potential key regulators for a process. Finally, we identified 789 consistently differential expressed genes; we summarized recurrently mutated genes and genes affected by significant copy number alterations. These genes may be stable biomarkers or important players during ESCC development. ESCCdb fills the gap between massive omics data and users' needs for integrated analysis and can promote basic and clinical ESCC research.

37639797,HMDB: A curated database of genes involved in hydrocarbon monooxygenation reaction with homologous genes as background.,"The investigation of hydrocarbon degradation potential of environmental microorganisms is an important research topic, whether for the global carbon cycle or oil pollution remediation. Under aerobic conditions, the microorganisms employ a range of monooxygenases to use hydrocarbons substrates as a source of carbon and energy. With the explosion of sequencing data, mining genes in genomes or metagenomes has become computationally expensive and time-consuming. We proposed the HMDB, which is a professional gene database of hydrocarbon monooxygenases. HMDB contains 38 genes, which encode 11 monooxygenases responsible for the hydroxylation of 8 hydrocarbons. To reduce false positives, the strategy of using homologous genes as background noise was applied for HMDB. We added 10,095 gene sequences of homologous enzymes which took non-hydrocarbons as substrates to HMDB. The classic BLAST method and best-hit strategy were recommended for HMDB usage, but not limited. The performance of HMDB was validated using 264,402 prokaryote genomes from RefSeq and 51 metagenomes from SRA. The results showed that HMDB database had high sensitivity and low false positive rate. We release the HMDB database here, hoping to speed up the process for investigation of hydrocarbon monooxygenases in massive metagenomic data.

39982792,Integrating AI-powered text mining from PubTator into the manual curation workflow at the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.,"The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a manually curated knowledge- and discovery-base that seeks to advance understanding about the relationship between environmental exposures and human health. CTD's manual curation process extracts from the biomedical literature molecular relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, phenotypes, diseases, anatomical terms, and species. These relationships are organized in a highly systematic way in order to make them not only informative but also scientifically computational, enabling inferential hypotheses to be formed to address gaps in understanding. Integral to CTD's functionality is the use of structured, hierarchical ontologies and controlled vocabularies to describe these molecular relationships. Normalizing text (i.e. translating raw text from the literature into these controlled vocabularies) can be a time-consuming process for biocurators. To facilitate the normalization process and improve the efficiency with which our scientists curate the literature, CTD evaluated and integrated into the curation process PubTator 3.0, a state-of-the-art, AI-powered resource which extracts and normalizes from the literature many of the key biomedical concepts CTD curates. Here, we describe CTD's long-standing history with Natural Language Processing (NLP), how this history helped form our objectives for NLP integration, the evaluation of PubTator against our objectives, and the integration of PubTator into CTD's curation workflow.

36263784,BIC: a database for the transcriptional landscape of bacteria in cancer.,"Microbial communities are massively resident in the human body, yet dysbiosis has been reported to correlate with many diseases, including various cancers. Most studies focus on the gut microbiome, while the bacteria that participate in tumor microenvironments on site remain unclear. Previous studies have acquired the bacteria expression profiles from RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing, and whole exon sequencing in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, small-RNA sequencing data were rarely used. Using TCGA miRNA sequencing data, we evaluated bacterial abundance in 32 types of cancer. To uncover the bacteria involved in cancer, we applied an analytical process to align unmapped human reads to bacterial references and developed the BIC database for the transcriptional landscape of bacteria in cancer. BIC provides cancer-associated bacterial information, including the relative abundance of bacteria, bacterial diversity, associations with clinical relevance, the co-expression network of bacteria and human genes, and their associated biological functions. These results can complement previously published databases. Users can easily download the result plots and tables, or download the bacterial abundance matrix for further analyses.

A comprehensive dataset of TG-43 parameters is compiled, including detailed source descriptions, dose-rate constants, radial dose functions, 1D and 2D anisotropy functions, along-away dose-rate tables, Primary and Scatter Separated (PSS) dose tables, and mean photon energies escaping each source. The database also documents the source models which are freely distributed with egs_brachy.<h4>Acquisition and validation methods</h4>Datasets are calculated after a recoding of the source geometries using the egs++ geometry package and its egs_brachy extensions. Air kerma per history is calculated in a 10   ×  10  ×  $\,{\times}\, 10\,{\times}\,$  0.05 cm<sup>3</sup> voxel located 100 cm from the source along the transverse axis and then corrected for the lateral and thickness dimensions of the scoring voxel to give the air kerma on the central axis at a point 100 cm from the source's mid-point. Full-scatter water phantoms with varying voxel resolutions in cylindrical coordinates are used for dose calculations. Most data (except for <sup>60</sup> Co) are based on the assumption of charged particle equilibrium and ignore the potentially large effects of electron transport very close to the source and dose from initial beta particles. These effects are evaluated for four representative sources. For validation, data are compared to those from CLRP_TG43v1 and published data.<h4>Data format and access</h4>Data are available at https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/egs_brachy/seed_database_v2 or http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/tg43v2 including in Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheets, and are presented graphically in comparisons to previously published data for each source.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The CLRP_TG43v2 database has applications in research, dosimetry, and brachytherapy planning.

With an increase in the number of compounds for these datasets, a network graph analysis and visualization of the correlation structure is difficult to interpret. We have developed the Chemical Correlation Database (CCDB), as a systematic catalogue of inter-chemical correlation in publicly available metabolomics and exposomics studies. The database has been provided via an online interface to create single compound-centric views. We have demonstrated various applications of the database to explore: 1) the chemicals from a chemical class such as Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and tobacco smoke related metabolites; 2) xenobiotic metabolites such as caffeine and acetaminophen; 3) endogenous metabolites (acyl-carnitines); and 4) unannotated peaks for PFAS. The database has a rich collection of 35 human studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and high-quality untargeted metabolomics datasets. CCDB is supported by a simple, interactive and user-friendly web-interface to retrieve and visualize the inter-chemical correlation data.

Organs-on-a-chip technology, as opposed to traditional two-dimensional cell culture and animal models, can more closely simulate pathologic and toxicologic interactions between different organs or tissues and reflect the collaborative response of multiple organs to drugs. Despite the fact that many organs-on-a-chip-related data have been published, none of the current databases have all of the following functions: searching, downloading, as well as analyzing data and results from the literature on organs-on-a-chip.

35936325,Development and Evaluation of a Sound-Swapped Video Database for Misophonia.,"Misophonia has been characterized as intense negative reactions to specific trigger sounds (often orofacial sounds like chewing, sniffling, or slurping). However, recent research suggests high-level, contextual, and multisensory factors are also involved. We recently demonstrated that neurotypicals' negative reactions to aversive sounds (e.g., nails scratching a chalkboard) are attenuated when the sounds are synced with <i>positive attributable video sources</i> (PAVS; e.g., tearing a piece of paper). To assess whether this effect generalizes to misophonic triggers, we developed a Sound-Swapped Video (SSV) database for use in misophonia research. In Study 1, we created a set of 39 video clips depicting common trigger sounds (<i>original video sources</i>, OVS) and a corresponding set of 39 PAVS temporally synchronized with the OVS videos. In Study 2, participants (<i>N</i> = 34) rated the 39 PAVS videos for their audiovisual match and pleasantness. We selected the 20 PAVS videos with best match scores for use in Study 3. In Study 3, a new group of participants (<i>n</i> = 102) observed the 20 selected PAVS and 20 corresponding OVS and judged the pleasantness or unpleasantness of each sound in the two contexts accompanying each video. Afterward, participants completed the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ). The results of Study 3 show a robust attenuating effect of PAVS videos on the reported unpleasantness of trigger sounds: trigger sounds were rated as significantly less unpleasant when paired with PAVS with than OVS. Moreover, this attenuating effect was present in nearly every participant (99 out of 102) regardless of their score on the MQ. In fact, we found a moderate positive correlation between the PAVS-OVS difference and misophonia severity scores. Overall our results provide validation that the SSV database is a useful stimulus database to study how misophonic responses can be modulated by visual contexts. Here, we release the SSV database with the best 18 PAVS and 18 OVS videos used in Study 3 along with aggregate ratings of audio-video match and pleasantness (https://osf.io/3ysfh/).

As a high-value and low-volume organic product, optimizing plant yield and modifying composition by leveraging knowledge on chemical profiles of essential oils can lead to enhanced bioproducts. Additionally, overharvesting of wild medicinal plants, especially in India, threatens biodiversity. Essential oil profiles of such plants can help regulate their exploitation. Here, we present sCentInDB, a manually curated FAIR-compliant DataBase of Essential oil Chemical profiles of Medicinal plants of India, compiled from published literature. sCentInDB contains data on 554 Indian medicinal plants at the plant part level, encompassing 2170 essential oil profiles, 3420 chemicals, 471 plant-part-therapeutic use associations, 120 plant-part-odor associations, and 218 plant-part-color associations. sCentInDB also compiles metadata such as sample location, isolation, and analysis methods. Subsequently, an extensive analysis of the chemical space in sCentInDB was performed. By constructing a chemical similarity network, terpenoids were found to be distributed across the network, indicating greater structural diversity. Moreover, a comparison of the scaffold diversity of chemicals in sCentInDB was performed against three other aroma libraries using cyclic system retrieval curves. Altogether, sCentInDB will serve as a valuable resource for researchers working on plant volatiles and employing genetic engineering to enhance oil yield and composition.

38164624,AptaDB: a comprehensive database integrating aptamer-target interactions.,"Aptamers have emerged as research hotspots of the next generation due to excellent performance benefits and application potentials in pharmacology, medicine, and analytical chemistry. Despite the numerous aptamer investigations, the lack of comprehensive data integration has hindered the development of computational methods for aptamers and the reuse of aptamers. A public access database named AptaDB, derived from experimentally validated data manually collected from the literature, was hence developed, integrating comprehensive aptamer-related data, which include six key components: (i) experimentally validated aptamer-target interaction information, (ii) aptamer property information, (iii) structure information of aptamer, (iv) target information, (v) experimental activity information, and (vi) algorithmically calculated similar aptamers.

40343712,GenDiS3 database: census on the prevalence of protein domain superfamilies of known structure in the entire sequence database.,"Despite the vast amount of sequence data available, a significant disparity exists between the number of protein sequences identified and the relatively few structures that have been resolved. This disparity highlights the challenge in structural biology to bridge the gap between sequence information and 3D structural data, and the necessity for robust databases capable of linking distant homologs to known structures. Studies have indicated that there are a limited number of structural folds, despite the vast diversity of proteins. Hence, computational tools can enhance our ability to classify protein sequences, much before their structures are determined or their functions are characterized, thereby bridging the gap between sequence and structural data. GenDiS (Genomic Distribution of Superfamilies) is a repository with information on the genomic distribution of protein domain superfamilies, involving a one-time computational exercise to search for trusted homologs of protein domains of known structures against the vast sequence database. We have updated this database employing advanced bioinformatics tools, including DELTA-BLAST (domain enhanced lookup time accelerated BLAST) for initial detection of hits and HMMSCAN for validation, significantly improving the accuracy of domain identification. Using these tools, over 151 million sequence homologs for 2060 superfamilies [SCOPe (Structural Classification of Proteins extended)] were identified and 116 million out of them were validated as true positives. Through a case study on glycolysis-related enzymes, variations in domain architectures of these enzymes are explored, revealing evolutionary changes and functional diversity among these essential proteins.

37951713,PlantIntronDB: a database for plant introns that host functional elements.,"Although more and more attention has been focused on introns and the important role of plant introns in plant growth and development has been discovered, there is still a lack of an open and comprehensive database on plant introns with functional elements in current research. In order to make full use of large-scale sequencing data and help researchers in related fields to achieve high-throughput functional verification of identified plant introns with functional elements, we designed a database containing five plant species, PlantIntronDB and systematically analyzed 358, 59, 185, 210 and 141 RNA-seq samples from Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), Gossypium raimondii (cotton), Zea mays (maize), Brassica napus (oilseed rape) and Oryza sativa Japonica Group (rice). In total, we found 100 126 introns that host functional elements in these five species. Specifically, we found that among all species, the number of introns with functional elements on the positive and negative strands is similar, with a length mostly smaller than 1500 bp, and the Adenine/Thymine (A/T) content is much higher than that of Guanine/Cytosine (G/C). In addition, the distribution of functional elements in introns varies among different species. All the above data can be downloaded for free in this database. This database provides a concise, comprehensive and user-friendly web interface, allowing users to easily retrieve target data based on their needs, using relevant organizational options.

We developed T-cell COVID-19 Atlas (T-CoV, https://t-cov.hse.ru) - the comprehensive web portal, which allows one to analyze how SARS-CoV-2 mutations alter the presentation of viral peptides by HLA molecules. The data are presented for common virus variants and the most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles. Binding affinities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants.

36509942,Crime Stereotypicality and Severity Database (CriSSD): Subjective norms for 63 crimes.,"The existence of crime-related racial stereotypes has been well documented. People tend to associate certain groups with specific crimes, which, in turn, impacts criminal-sentencing decisions through the perceptions of crime severity. This evidence calls for regular updating of rating norms combining these variables. With this objective, and given that most of the normative studies provide norms for a small number of crimes and/or with an insufficient number of participants, a new norming study was conducted. Furthermore, norms from European countries are absent, and the existing ones (mostly with USA-based populations) do not simultaneously examine crime stereotypicality and crime severity. The Crime Stereotypicality and Severity Database (CriSSD) presents normative ratings for a set of 63 crimes on three dimensions: White stereotypicality, Black stereotypicality, and crime severity. The crimes were selected according to a comprehensive procedure. A total of 340 Portuguese participants (72.6% female; M<sub>age</sub> = 26.86, SD = 7.65) answered an online survey. Each crime was evaluated by a range of 46-60 participants. Data allowed us to identify a crime typology with three clusters. We present descriptive data (means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals) for each crime. Crime evaluations were associated with sociodemographic characteristics. Additionally, this study gives input regarding the understudied link between crime stereotypes and crime severity, showing that crime severity is predicted by ratings of both Black and White stereotypicality.

38885636,FerroLigandDB: A Ferroptosis Ligand Database of Structure-Activity Relations.,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation that is linked to the pathophysiological processes in many diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, ischemia-reperfusion injuries, and organ damages. Many proteins are associated with ferroptosis signal transduction pathways. Novel chemical compounds are demanded to explore and regulate these pathways. Therefore, a ferroptosis ligand database, which holds relations among chemical structures, targets, bioactivities, and diseases, is needed for discovering and designing new ferroptosis regulators. This work reports FerroLigandDB, a manually curated database for small-molecular ferroptosis regulators. The database comprises 466 ferroptosis inducer entries (with 380 unique molecular structures) and 539 ferroptosis inhibitor entries (with 468 unique molecular structures) (note: one compound can be recorded as multiple entries due to the different assays). Each ferroptosis ligand entry is detailed with compound IDs, structure attributes, bioactivity values, test objects, target information, associated diseases, and references. The fields in the FerroLigandDB database implicitly contain relationships among chemical structures, bioactivities, targets, and diseases. Thus, FerroLigandDB is a comprehensive resource for scientists to design and discover novel ferroptosis regulators. The user interface of FerroLigandDB is implemented with query features and data visualization facilities.

Since most PTMs are dynamically regulated, quantifying PTM events under different states is crucial for understanding biological processes and diseases. With the rapid development of high-throughput proteomics technologies, massive quantitative PTM proteome datasets have been generated. Thus, a comprehensive one-stop data resource for surfing big data will benefit the community.

36329825,'Targeting' the search: An upgraded structural and functional repository of antimicrobial peptides for biofilm studies (B-AMP v2.0) with a focus on biofilm protein targets.,"Bacterial biofilms, often as multispecies communities, are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics, making the treatment of biofilm infections a challenge. There is a push towards developing novel anti-biofilm approaches, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), with activity against specific biofilm targets. In previous work, we developed Biofilm-AMP, a structural and functional repository of AMPs for biofilm studies (B-AMP v1.0) with more than 5000 structural models of AMPs and a vast library of AMP annotations to existing biofilm literature. In this study, we present an upgraded version of B-AMP, with a focus on existing and novel bacterial biofilm targets. B-AMP v2.0 hosts a curated collection of 2502 biofilm protein targets across 473 bacterial species, with structural protein models and functional annotations from PDB, UniProt, and PubMed databases. The biofilm targets can be searched for using the name of the source organism, and function and type of protein, and results include designated Target IDs (unique to B-AMP v2.0), UniProt IDs, 3D predicted protein structures, PDBQT files, pre-defined protein functions, and relevant scientific literature. To present an example of the combined applicability of both, the AMP and biofilm target libraries in the repository, we present two case studies. In the first case study, we expand an <i>in silico</i> pipeline to evaluate AMPs against a single biofilm target in the multidrug resistant, bacterial pathogen <i>Corynebacterium striatum</i>, using 3D protein-peptide docking models from previous work and Molecular Dynamics simulations (~1.2µs). In the second case study, we build an <i>in silico</i> pipeline to identify candidate AMPs (using AMPs with both anti-Gram positive and anti-Gram negative activity) against two biofilm targets with a common functional annotation in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, widely-encountered bacterial co-pathogens. With its enhanced structural and functional capabilities, B-AMP v2.0 serves as a comprehensive resource for AMP investigations related to biofilm studies.

35592546,The EWAS Catalog: a database of epigenome-wide association studies.,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) seek to quantify associations between traits/exposures and DNA methylation measured at thousands or millions of CpG sites across the genome. In recent years, the increase in availability of DNA methylation measures in population-based cohorts and case-control studies has resulted in a dramatic expansion of the number of EWAS being performed and published. To make this rich source of results more accessible, we have manually curated a database of CpG-trait associations (with p<1x10 <sup>-4</sup>) from published EWAS, each assaying over 100,000 CpGs in at least 100 individuals. From January 7, 2022, The EWAS Catalog contained 1,737,746 associations from 2,686 EWAS. This includes 1,345,398 associations from 342 peer-reviewed publications. In addition, it also contains summary statistics for 392,348 associations from 427 EWAS, performed on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The database is accompanied by a web-based tool and R package, giving researchers the opportunity to query EWAS associations quickly and easily, and gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of disease as well as the impact of traits and exposures on the DNA methylome. The EWAS Catalog data extraction team continue to update the database monthly and we encourage any EWAS authors to upload their summary statistics to our website.

Dysregulated CRE and SCRE activities have been reported to alter the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, thereby regulating cancer hallmarks. To address the strong need for a comprehensive catalogue of dysregulated CREs and SCREs in human cancers, we present TSCRE (http://tscre.zsqylab.com/), an open resource providing tumor-specific and cell type-specific CREs and SCREs derived from the re-analysis of publicly available histone modification profiles.

39197059,MACSFeD-a database of mosquito acoustic communication and swarming features.,"Acoustic communication plays an important role during the courtship of many mosquito species. Male mosquitoes show strong attraction to female wing beat frequencies, mediated via spectral matching between female wing beat frequency and male ear mechanical tuning frequency. Such acoustic communication typically occurs within swarms, male-dominated aggregations with species-specific properties. Despite hundreds of relevant publications being available, the lack of a central platform hosting all associated data hinders research efforts and limits cross-species comparisons. Here, we introduce MACSFeD (Mosquito Acoustic Communication and Swarming Features Database), an interactive platform for the exploration of our comprehensive database containing 251 unique reports focusing on different aspects of mosquito acoustic communication, including hearing function, wing beat frequency and phonotaxis, as well as male swarming parameters.

36641216,Visualizing and accessing correlated SAXS data sets with Similarity Maps and Simple Scattering web resources.,"Constructing a comprehensive understanding of macromolecular behavior from a set of correlated small angle scattering (SAS) data is aided by tools that analyze all scattering curves together. SAS experiments on biological systems can be performed on specimens that are more easily prepared, modified, and formatted relative to those of most other techniques. An X-ray SAS measurement (SAXS) can be performed in less than a milli-second in-line with treatment steps such as purification or exposure to modifiers. These capabilities are valuable since biological macromolecules (proteins, polynucleotides, lipids, and carbohydrates) change conformation or assembly under specific conditions that often define their biological role. Furthermore, mutation or post-translational modification change their behavior and provides an avenue to tailor their mechanics. Here, we describe tools to combine multiple correlated SAS measurements for analysis and review their application to biological systems. The SAXS Similarity Map (SSM) compares a set of scattering curves and quantifies the similarity between them for display as a color on a grid. Visualizing an entire correlated data set with SSMs helps identify patterns that reveal biological functions. The SSM analysis is available as a web-based tool at https://sibyls.als.lbl.gov/saxs-similarity/. To make data available and promote tool development, we have also deployed a repository of correlated SAS data sets called Simple Scattering (available at https://simplescattering.com).

While chemical algicides are widely used for HABs control due to their rapid efficacy, the lack of systematic data integration and concerns over environmental toxicity limit their broader application. To address these challenges, we developed AlgicideDB, a manually curated database containing 1,672 algicidal records on 542 algicides targeting 110 algal species. Using this database, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of algicides and proposed an algicide-likeness scoring function to facilitate the exploration of compounds with antialgal properties. Additionally, we evaluated the acute toxicity of algicidal compounds to non-target aquatic organisms of different trophic levels to assess their ecological risks.

These innovative sequencing techniques empower researchers to dissect perturbation effects in biological systems at an unprecedented resolution. Despite these advancements, a notable gap exists in the availability of a dedicated database for exploring scPerturbation data. To address this gap, we present PerturBase, the most comprehensive database designed for the analysis and visualization of scPerturbation data (http://www.perturbase.cn/). PerturBase curates 122 datasets from 46 publicly available studies, covering 115 single-modal and 7 multi-modal datasets that include 24 254 genetic and 230 chemical perturbations from approximately 5 million cells.

37542408,CiliaMiner: an integrated database for ciliopathy genes and ciliopathies.,"Cilia are found in eukaryotic species ranging from single-celled organisms, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to humans, but not in plants. The ability to respond to repellents and/or attractants, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and provide cellular mobility are just a few examples of how crucial cilia are to cells and organisms. Over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. Because of the complexity of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required. Here, we present CiliaMiner, a manually curated ciliopathy database that includes ciliopathy lists collected from articles and databases. Analysis reveals that there are 55 distinct disorders likely related to ciliopathy, with over 4000 clinical manifestations. Based on comparative symptom analysis and subcellular localization data, diseases are classified as primary, secondary or atypical ciliopathies. CiliaMiner provides easy access to all of these diseases and disease genes, as well as clinical features and gene-specific clinical features, as well as subcellular localization of each protein.

35068457,Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal: A Catalog of Genetic Findings for Alzheimer's Disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetics findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) span progressively larger and more diverse populations and outcomes. Currently, there is no up-to-date resource providing harmonized and searchable information on all AD genetic associations found by GWAS, nor linking the reported genetic variants and genes with functional and genomic annotations.<h4>Objective</h4>Create an integrated/harmonized, and literature-derived collection of population-specific AD genetic associations.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed the Alzheimer's Disease Variant Portal (ADVP), an extensive collection of associations curated from >200 GWAS publications from Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium and other consortia. Genetic associations were systematically extracted, harmonized, and annotated from both the genome-wide significant and suggestive loci reported in these publications. To ensure consistent representation of AD genetic findings, all the extracted genetic association information was harmonized across specifically designed publication, variant, and association categories.<h4>Results</h4>ADVP V1.0 (February 2021) catalogs 6,990 associations related to disease-risk, expression quantitative traits, endophenotypes, or neuropathology. This extensive harmonization effort led to a catalog containing >900 loci, >1,800 variants, >80 cohorts, and 8 populations. Besides, ADVP provides investigators with a seamless integration of genomic and publicly available functional annotations across multiple databases per harmonized variant and gene records, thus facilitating further understanding and analyses of these genetics findings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ADVP is a valuable resource for investigators to quickly and systematically explore high-confidence AD genetic findings and provides insights into population-specific AD genetic architecture.

37427797,"TarpiD, a database of putative and validated targets of piRNAs.","Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a novel class of 18-36 nts long small non-coding single-stranded RNAs that play crucial roles in a wide array of critical biological activities besides maintaining genome integrity by transposon silencing. piRNAs influence biological processes and pathways by regulating gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Studies have reported that piRNAs silence various endogenous genes post-transcriptionally by binding to respective mRNAs through interaction with the PIWI proteins. Several thousands of piRNAs have been discovered in animals, but their functions remain largely undiscovered owing to a lack of proper guiding principles of piRNA targeting or diversity in targeting patterns amongst piRNAs from the same or different species. Identification of piRNA targets is essential for deciphering their functions. There are a few tools and databases on piRNAs, but there are no systematic and exclusive repositories to obtain information on target genes regulated by piRNAs and other related information. Hence, we developed a user-friendly database named TarpiD (Targets of piRNA Database) that offers comprehensive information on piRNA and its targets, including their expression, methodologies (high-throughput or low-throughput) for target identification/validation, cells/tissue types, diseases, target gene regulation types, target binding regions, and key functions driven by piRNAs through target gene interactions. The contents of TarpiD are curated from the published literature and enable users to search and download the targets of a particular piRNA or the piRNAs that target a specific gene for use in their research. This database harbours 28 682 entries of piRNA-target interactions supported by 15 methodologies reported in hundreds of cell types/tissues from 9 species.

36969452,SCARdock: A Web Server and Manually Curated Resource for Discovering Covalent Ligands.,"<h4>Background</h4>Covalent drugs have been intentionally discarded historically due to the concern of off-target side effects, but the past decade has seen a fast resurgence of the discovery of covalent drugs. Compared to noncovalent ligands, covalent ligands might have better biochemical efficiency, lower patient burden, less dosing frequency, less drug resistance, and improved target specificity.<h4>Results</h4>Previously, we proposed the steric-clashes alleviating receptor (SCAR) strategy for screening and repurposing covalent inhibitors. To help the discovery of covalent ligands targeting protein targets, we have developed a web server dedicated to providing the SCARdock protocol to general users. Along with this server, we presented three high-quality data sets for the discovery of covalent ligands: a manually curated data set containing 954 high-quality complex structures of covalent ligands and proteins, a manually curated data set of 68 experimentally confirmed covalent warheads targeting 11 different residues, and a prefiltered, classified, and ready-to-use data set of 690,018 entries of purchasable virtual compounds containing these experimentally verified warheads.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SCARdock server and the accompanied data sets would be of great value to the discovery of covalent ligands and are available freely at http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/ or https://scardock.com.",True,False,4.0,,scardock,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,SCARdock,True,8.0,True,True,http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/ | https://scardock.com,http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/,True,...y of covalent ligands and are available freely at http://www.liugroup.site/scardock/ or https://scardock.com.,1

37428248,Deep learning model for predicting the survival of patients with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma based on the SEER database and a multicentre external validation cohort.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Due to the rarity of primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL), the prognostic factors and optimal management of PGIL have not been clearly defined. We aimed to establish prognostic models using a deep learning algorithm for survival prediction.<h4>Methods</h4>We collected 11,168 PGIL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to form the training and test cohorts. At the same time, we collected 82 PGIL patients from three medical centres to form the external validation cohort. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, random survival forest (RSF) model, and neural multitask logistic regression (DeepSurv) model to predict PGIL patients' overall survival (OS).<h4>Results</h4>The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of PGIL patients in the SEER database were 77.1%, 69.4%, 63.7%, and 50.3%, respectively. The RSF model based on all variables showed that the top three most important variables for predicting OS were age, histological type, and chemotherapy. The independent risk factors for PGIL patient prognosis included sex, age, race, primary site, Ann Arbor stage, histological type, symptom, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, according to the Lasso regression analysis. Using these factors, we built the CoxPH and DeepSurv models. The DeepSurv model's C-index values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.742 in the test cohort, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort, which demonstrated that the DeepSurv model performed better compared to the RSF model (0.728) and the CoxPH model (0.724). The DeepSurv model accurately predicted 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS. Both calibration curves and decision curve analysis curves demonstrated the superior performance of the DeepSurv model. We developed the DeepSurv model as an online web calculator for survival prediction, which can be accessed at http://124.222.228.112:8501/ .<h4>Conclusions</h4>This DeepSurv model with external validation is superior to previous studies in predicting short-term and long-term survival and can help us make better-individualized decisions for PGIL patients.",True,False,4.5,,,seer,16.0,ok,,cox proportional hazards | deepsurv,coxph | rsf,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,http://124.222.228.112:8501/,http://124.222.228.112:8501/,True,"...for survival prediction, which can be accessed at http://124.222.228.112:8501/ .<h4>Conclusions</h4>This DeepSurv model with ext...",1

37805704,AgingReG: a curated database of aging regulatory relationships in humans.,"Aging and cellular senescence are characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, which could be triggered by aging factors such as physiological, pathological and external factors. Numerous studies have shown that gene regulatory events play crucial roles in aging, increasing the need for a comprehensive repository of regulatory relationships during aging. Here, we established a manually curated database of aging factors (AgingReG, https://bio.liclab.net/Aging-ReG/), focusing on the regulatory relationships during aging with experimental evidence in humans. By curating thousands of published literature, 2157 aging factor entries (1345 aging gene entries, 804 external factor entries and eight aging-related pathway entries) and related regulatory information were manually curated. The regulatory relationships were classified into four types according to their functions: (i) upregulation, which indicates that aging factors upregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (ii) downregulation, which indicates that aging factors downregulate the expression of target genes during aging; (iii) activation, which indicates that aging factors influence the activity of target genes during aging and (iv) inhibition, which indicates that aging factors inhibit the activation of target molecule activity, leading to declined or lost target activity. AgingReG involves 651 upregulating pairs, 632 downregulating pairs, 330 activation-regulating pairs and 34 inhibition-regulating pairs, covering 195 disease types and more than 800 kinds of cells and tissues from 1784 published literature studies.

Although clinical trials were rapidly established during this pandemic, identifying suitable study subjects can be challenging. For this reason, the University Hospital Cologne established a volunteer registry for participation in clinical trials first in Germany, which has now been incorporated into the European VACCELERATE clinical trials network and grew to a European Volunteer Registry. As such, VACCELERATE's Volunteer Registry aims to become a common entry point for potential volunteers in future clinical trials in Europe.<h4>Methods</h4>Interested volunteers who would like to register for clinical trials in the VACCELERATE Volunteer Registry can access the registration questionnaire via http://www.vaccelerate.eu/volunteer-registry. Potential volunteers are requested to provide their current country and area of residence, contact information, including first and last name and e-mail address, age, gender, comorbidities, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination status, and maximum distance willing to travel to a clinical trial site. The registry is open to both adults and children, complying with national legal consent requirements.<h4>Results</h4>As of May 2022, the questionnaire is available in 12 countries and 14 languages. Up to date, more than 36,000 volunteers have registered, mainly from Germany.

37871298,HGMMX: Host Gut Microbiota Metabolism Xenobiotics Database.,"The metagenome of bacteria colonizing the human intestine is a set of genes that is almost 150 times greater than the set of host genes. Some of these genes encode enzymes whose functioning significantly expands the number of potential pathways for xenobiotic metabolism. The resulting metabolites can exhibit activity different from that of the parent compound. This can decrease the efficacy of pharmacotherapy as well as induce undesirable and potentially life-threatening side effects. Thus, analysis of the biotransformation of small drug-like compounds mediated by the gut microbiota is an important step in the development of new pharmaceutical agents and repurposing of the approved drugs. <i>In vitro</i> research, the interaction of drug-like compounds with the gut microbiota is a multistep and time-consuming process. Systematic testing of large sets of chemical structures is associated with a number of challenges, including the lack of standardized techniques and significant financial costs to identify the structure of the final metabolites. Estimation of the compounds' ability to be biotransformed by the gut microbiota and prediction of the structures of their metabolites are possible <i>in silico</i>. However, the development of computational approaches is limited by the lack of information about chemical structures metabolized by microbiota enzymes. The aim of this study is to create a database containing information on the metabolism of drug-like compounds by the gut microbiota. We created the data set containing information about 368 structures metabolized and 310 structures not metabolized by the human gut microbiota.

39231258,CuPCA: a web server for pan-cancer association analysis of large-scale cuproptosis-related genes.,"Copper-induced cell death is a novel mechanism of cell death, which is defined as cuproptosis. The increasing level of copper can produce toxicity in cells and may cause the occurrence of cell death. Several previous studies have proved that cuproptosis has a tight association with various cancers. Thus, the discovery of relationships between cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) and human cancers is of great importance. Pan-cancer analysis can efficiently help researchers find out the relationship between multiple cancers and target genes precisely and make various prognostic analyses on cancers and cancer patients. Pan-cancer web servers can provide researchers with direct results of pan-cancer prognostic analyses, which can greatly improve the efficiency of their work. However, to date, no web server provides pan-cancer analysis about CRGs. Therefore, we introduce the cuproptosis pan-cancer analysis database (CuPCA), the first database for various analysis results of CRGs through 33 cancer types. CuPCA is a user-friendly resource for cancer researchers to gain various prognostic analyses between cuproptosis and cancers. It provides single CRG pan-cancer analysis, multi-CRGs pan-cancer analysis, multi-CRlncRNA pan-cancer analysis, and mRNA-circRNA-lncRNA conjoint analysis. These analysis results can not only indicate the relationship between cancers and cuproptosis at both gene level and protein level, but also predict the conditions of different cancer patients, which include their clinical condition, survival condition, and their immunological condition.

37953384,PGS-Depot: a comprehensive resource for polygenic scores constructed by summary statistics based methods.,"Polygenic score (PGS) is an important tool for the genetic prediction of complex traits. However, there are currently no resources providing comprehensive PGSs computed from published summary statistics, and it is difficult to implement and run different PGS methods due to the complexity of their pipelines and parameter settings. To address these issues, we introduce a new resource called PGS-Depot containing the most comprehensive set of publicly available disease-related GWAS summary statistics. PGS-Depot includes 5585 high quality summary statistics (1933 quantitative and 3652 binary trait statistics) curated from 1564 traits in European and East Asian populations. A standardized best-practice pipeline is used to implement 11 summary statistics-based PGS methods, each with different model assumptions and estimation procedures. The prediction performance of each method can be compared for both in- and cross-ancestry populations, and users can also submit their own summary statistics to obtain custom PGS with the available methods. Other features include searching for PGSs by trait name, publication, cohort information, population, or the MeSH ontology tree and searching for trait descriptions with the experimental factor ontology (EFO). All scores, SNP effect sizes and summary statistics can be downloaded via FTP.

Genetic code expansion (GCE) is the most common way to achieve this: a specific codon is selected to be decoded by a dedicated tRNA orthogonal to the endogenous ones. In the past 30 years, great progress has been made to obtain novel tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) accepting a variety of ncAAs with distinct physicochemical properties, to develop robust in vitro assays or approaches for codon reassignment. This sparked the use of the technique, leading to the accumulation of publications, from which gathering all relevant information can appear daunting.

The eG4s with higher occurrences across samples are more structurally stable, evolutionarily conserved, enriched in promoter regions, mark highly expressed genes and associate with complex regulatory programs, demonstrating higher confidence level for further experiments. Finally, we integrate millions of functional genomic variants and prioritize eG4s with regulatory functions in disease and cancer contexts. These efforts have culminated in the comprehensive and interactive database of experimentally validated DNA eG4s. As such, EndoQuad enables users to easily access, download and repurpose these data for their own research.

In the current database release, STAB2 provides a systematic cellular map of the human and mouse brain by integrating recently published large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from diverse regions and across lifespan. We applied a hierarchical strategy of unsupervised clustering on the integrated single-cell transcriptomic datasets to precisely annotate the cell types and subtypes in the human and mouse brain. Currently, STAB2 includes 71 and 61 different cell subtypes defined in the human and mouse brain, respectively. It covers 63 subregions and 15 developmental stages of human brain, and 38 subregions and 30 developmental stages of mouse brain, generating a comprehensive atlas for exploring spatiotemporal transcriptomic dynamics in the mammalian brain.

35660007,WheatCENet: A Database for Comparative Co-expression Networks Analysis of Allohexaploid Wheat and Its Progenitors.,"Genetic and epigenetic changes after polyploidization events could result in variable gene expression and modified regulatory networks. Here, using large-scale transcriptome data, we constructed co-expression networks for diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat species, and built a platform for comparing co-expression networks of allohexaploid wheat and its progenitors, named WheatCENet. WheatCENet is a platform for searching and comparing specific functional co-expression networks, as well as identifying the related functions of the genes clustered therein. Functional annotations like pathways, gene families, protein-protein interactions, microRNAs (miRNAs), and several lines of epigenome data are integrated into this platform, and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), motif identification, and other useful tools are also included. Using WheatCENet, we found that the network of WHEAT ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (WAPO1) has more co-expressed genes related to spike development in hexaploid wheat than its progenitors. We also found a novel motif of CCWWWWWWGG (CArG) specifically in the promoter region of WAPO-A1, suggesting that neofunctionalization of the WAPO-A1 gene affects spikelet development in hexaploid wheat. WheatCENet is useful for investigating co-expression networks and conducting other analyses, and thus facilitates comparative and functional genomic studies in wheat.

The genomes of associated partners have co-evolved, creating situations of interdependence that are complex to decipher despite the availability of their complete sequences. We developed ArtSymbioCyc, a metabolism-oriented database collection gathering genomic resources for arthropods and their associated bacteria. ArtSymbioCyc uses the powerful tools of the BioCyc community to produce high-quality annotations and to analyze and compare metabolic networks on a genome-wide scale. We used ArtSymbioCyc to study the case of the tripartite symbiosis of the cereal aphid <i>Sipha maydis</i> focusing on amino acid and vitamin metabolisms, as these compounds are known to be important in this strictly phloemophagous insect.

36495921,R-SIM: A Database of Binding Affinities for RNA-small Molecule Interactions.,"Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are involved in a multitude of crucial cellular functions by acting as a central conduit for information transfer. Due to their essential and versatile functional roles in the cell, RNAs have also been implicated in multiple disease conditions of therapeutic relevance including cancers, bacterial and viral infections and neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, several approaches have emerged to tap into the potentially unexplored regions of the druggable genome, which refers to the genes and gene products that are focused during drug development. For example, considering RNAs as viable alternative therapeutic targets for drug development can potentially expand the range of therapeutic targets. Consequently, the availability of adequate binding affinity measurements for RNA-small molecule interactions is essential to understand target selectivity and design more potent RNA-targeting drug-like molecules. To facilitate this growing need, we have curated a database of experimentally validated RNA-small molecule interactions, called RNA-Small molecule Interaction Miner (R-SIM). Each entry in R-SIM provides comprehensive information on sequence, structure and classification of the RNA target, various physicochemical properties of the small molecule, binding affinity value and corresponding experimental conditions, three-dimensional structure (experimental or modelled) of the RNA-small molecule complex, and the literature source for the data. It also provides a user-friendly web interface with several options for search, display, sorting, visualization, download and upload of the data.

Biomarkers in body fluids have gained considerable attention since the development of liquid biopsy, and their data volume is rapidly increasing. Nevertheless, current research lacks the compilation of published cancer body fluid biomarkers into a centralized and sustainable repository for researchers and clinicians, despite a handful of small-scale and specific data resources. To fulfill this purpose, we developed liquid biomarker (LiqBioer) containing 6231 manually curated records from 3447 studies, covering 3056 biomarkers and 74 types of cancer in 22 tissues.

35971647,The Brain Protein Atlas: A conglomerate of proteomics datasets of human neural tissue.,"The human brain represents one of the most complex biological structures with significant spatiotemporal molecular plasticity occurring through early development, learning, aging, and disease. While much progress has been made in mapping its transcriptional architecture, more downstream phenotypic readouts are relatively scarce due to limitations with tissue heterogeneity and accessibility, as well as an inability to amplify protein species prior to global -OMICS analysis. To address some of these barriers, our group has recently focused on using mass-spectrometry workflows compatible with small amounts of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. This has enabled exploration into spatiotemporal proteomic signatures of the brain and disease across otherwise inaccessible neurodevelopmental timepoints and anatomical niches. Given the similar theme and approaches, we introduce an integrated online portal, ""The Brain Protein Atlas (BPA)"" (www.brainproteinatlas.org), representing a public resource that allows users to access and explore these amalgamated datasets. Specifically, this portal contains a growing set of peer-reviewed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic datasets, including spatiotemporal profiles of human cerebral development, diffuse gliomas, clinically aggressive meningiomas, and a detailed anatomic atlas of glioblastoma. One barrier to entry in mass spectrometry-based proteomics data analysis is the steep learning curve required to extract biologically relevant data. BPA, therefore, includes several built-in analytical tools to generate relevant plots (e.g., volcano plots, heatmaps, boxplots, and scatter plots) and evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of proteins of interest. Future iterations aim to expand available datasets, including those generated by the community at large, and analytical tools for exploration.

To overcome these limitations, we collected postsynaptic PPIs complemented by a high amount of detailed structural and biological information and launched a freely available resource, the Postsynaptic Interaction Database (PSINDB), to make these data and annotations accessible. PSINDB includes tens of thousands of binding regions together with structural features, mediating and regulating the formation of PPIs, annotated with detailed experimental information about each interaction. PSINDB is expected to be useful for various aspects of molecular neurobiology research, from experimental design to network and systems biology-based modeling and analysis of changes in the protein network upon various stimuli.

Genetic variation, particularly SNPs in miRNA sequences and the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of their target genes, can disrupt miRNA-mRNA interactions, leading to altered gene expression. Despite several existing databases providing insights into various aspects of miRNAs and their target genes in association with the development of the disease. Still, there remains a critical gap in a unified, BC-specific repository that integrates SNPs in miRNAs, their target genes, and associated molecular mechanisms. To address this, we developed BreVamiR3' (Breast cancer-associated genetic Variations in miRNA and 3'UTR of their target genes), a novel, freely accessible database (https://brevamir3.web.app/index.html). BreVamiR3' features comprehensive and curated data on 500 miRNAs and 828 target genes associated with BC, including experimentally validated SNPs, chromosomal loci, expression profiles, BC subtypes, signaling pathways, and classifications of genes i.e. oncogene, tumor suppressor, or both. Unique features of BreVamiR3' include detailed annotations of SNPs disrupting miRNA-target interactions, subtype-specific miRNA expression, visualization of miRNA-chromosomal distributions and their experimental validation. Chromosome 19 harbours the highest number of BC-associated miRNAs, while target genes such as CCND1, KRAS, and ERBB2 demonstrate extensive miRNA regulation. By integrating genetic variations with functional and clinical relevance, BreVamiR3' provides a single platform to explore miRNA-mediated regulatory networks, their genetic variation, and downstream signaling pathways in BC.

Six years after introducing EzBioCloud, an integrated platform representing the taxonomic hierarchy of Bacteria and Archaea through quality-controlled 16S rRNA gene and genome sequences, we present an updated version, that further refines and expands its capabilities. The current update recognizes the growing need for accurate taxonomic information as defining a species increasingly relies on genome sequence comparisons. We also incorporated an advanced strategy for addressing underrepresented or less studied lineages, bolstering the comprehensiveness and accuracy of our database. Our rigorous quality control protocols remain, where whole-genome assemblies from the NCBI Assembly Database undergo stringent screening to remove low-quality sequence data. These are then passed through our enhanced identification bioinformatics pipeline which initiates a 16S rRNA gene similarity search and then calculates the average nucleotide identity (ANI). For genome sequences lacking a 16S rRNA sequence and without a closely related genomic representative for ANI calculation, we apply a different ANI approach using bacterial core genes for improved taxonomic placement (core gene ANI, cgANI). Because of the increase in genome sequences available in NCBI and our newly introduced cgANI method, EzBioCloud now encompasses a total of 109 835 species, of which 21 964 have validly published names. 47 896 are candidate species identified either through 16S rRNA sequence similarity (phylotypes) or through whole genome ANI (genomospecies), and the remaining 39 975 were positioned in the taxonomic tree by cgANI (species clusters).

36169329,BCSCdb: a database of biomarkers of cancer stem cells.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small heterogeneous population present within the tumor cells exhibiting self-renewal properties. CSCs have been demonstrated to elicit an important role in cancer recurrence, metastasis and drug resistance. CSCs are distinguished from cancer cell populations based on their molecular profiling or expression of distinct CSC biomarker(s). Recently, a huge amount of omics data have been generated for the characterization of CSCs, which enables distinguishing CSCs in different cancers. Here, we report biomarkers of the Cancer Stem Cells database (BCSCdb), a repository of information about CSC biomarkers. BCSCdb comprises CSC biomarkers collected from PubMed literature where these are identified using high-throughput and low-throughput methods. Each biomarker is provided with two different scores: the first is a confidence score to give confidence to reported CSC biomarkers based on the experimental method of detection in CSCs. The second is the global score to identify the global CSC biomarkers across 10 different types of cancer. This database contains three tables containing information about experimentally validated CSC biomarkers or genes, therapeutic target genes of CSCs and CSC biomarkers interactions. It contains information on three types of markers: high-throughput marker (HTM-8307), high-throughput marker validated by the low-throughput method (283) and low-throughput marker (LTM-525). A total of 171 low-throughput biomarkers were identified in primary tissue referred to as clinical biomarkers. Moreover, it contains 445 target genes for CSC therapeutics, 10 biomarkers targeted by clinical trial drugs in CSCs and 5 different types of interaction data for CSC biomarkers.

38282890,DynAMoS: The Dynamic Affective Movie Clip Database for Subjectivity Analysis.,"In this paper, we describe the design, collection, and validation of a new video database that includes holistic and dynamic emotion ratings from 83 participants watching 22 affective movie clips. In contrast to previous work in Affective Computing, which pursued a single ""ground truth"" label for the affective content of each moment of each video (e.g., by averaging the ratings of 2 to 7 trained participants), we embrace the subjectivity inherent to emotional experiences and provide the full distribution of all participants' ratings (with an average of 76.7 raters per video). We argue that this choice represents a paradigm shift with the potential to unlock new research directions, generate new hypotheses, and inspire novel methods in the Affective Computing community. We also describe several interdisciplinary use cases for the database: to provide dynamic norms for emotion elicitation studies (e.g., in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience), to train and test affective content analysis algorithms (e.g., for dynamic emotion recognition, video summarization, and movie recommendation), and to study subjectivity in emotional reactions (e.g., to identify moments of emotional ambiguity or ambivalence within movies, identify predictors of subjectivity, and develop personalized affective content analysis algorithms).

40052362,gymnotoa-db: a database and application to optimize functional annotation in gymnosperms.,"Gymnosperms are a clade of non-flowering plants that include about 1000 living species. Due to their complex genomes and lack of genomic resources, functional annotation in genomics and transcriptomics on gymnosperms suffers from limitations. Here we present gymnotoa-db, which is a novel, publicly accessible relational database designed to facilitate functional annotation in gymnosperms. This database stores non-redundant records of gymnosperm proteins, encompassing taxonomic and functional information. The complementary software, gymnotoa-app, enables users to download gymnotoa-db and execute a comprehensive functional annotation pipeline for high-throughput sequencing-derived DNA or cDNA sequences. gymnotoa-app's user-friendly interface and efficient algorithms streamline the functional annotation process, making it an invaluable tool for researchers studying gymnosperms. We compared gymnotoa-app's performance against other annotation tools utilizing disparate reference databases.

38889117,CAManim: Animating end-to-end network activation maps.,"Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in numerous domains due to their high performance and accessibility to developers and application-specific end-users. Fundamental to image-based applications is the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which possess the ability to automatically extract features from data. However, comprehending these complex models and their learned representations, which typically comprise millions of parameters and numerous layers, remains a challenge for both developers and end-users. This challenge arises due to the absence of interpretable and transparent tools to make sense of black-box models. There exists a growing body of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) literature, including a collection of methods denoted Class Activation Maps (CAMs), that seek to demystify what representations the model learns from the data, how it informs a given prediction, and why it, at times, performs poorly in certain tasks. We propose a novel XAI visualization method denoted CAManim that seeks to simultaneously broaden and focus end-user understanding of CNN predictions by animating the CAM-based network activation maps through all layers, effectively depicting from end-to-end how a model progressively arrives at the final layer activation. Herein, we demonstrate that CAManim works with any CAM-based method and various CNN architectures. Beyond qualitative model assessments, we additionally propose a novel quantitative assessment that expands upon the Remove and Debias (ROAD) metric, pairing the qualitative end-to-end network visual explanations assessment with our novel quantitative ""yellow brick ROAD"" assessment (ybROAD). This builds upon prior research to address the increasing demand for interpretable, robust, and transparent model assessment methodology, ultimately improving an end-user's trust in a given model's predictions.

They also face the problem of short read length, isoform ambiguities, biases and artifacts. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) technologies, commercialized by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), enable the direct interrogation of any given modification present in individual transcripts and promise to address the limitations of previous NGS-based methods.

It is a comprehensive repository of 80,170, 39,108, 83,330, and 11,500 unique fusions detected in 1280, 637, 697, and 181 RNA-Seq samples of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Oryza sativa japonica</i>, <i>Oryza sativa indica</i>, and <i>Cicer arietinum</i> respectively. Here, a total of 76,599 (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), 35,480 (<i>Oryza sativa japonica</i>), 72,099 (<i>Oryza sativa indica</i>), and 9524 (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>) fusion transcripts are non-recurrent i.e., only found in one sample. Identification of FTs was performed by using a total of five tools viz. EricScript-Plants, STAR-Fusion, TrinityFusion, SQUID, and MapSplice. At PFusionDB, available fundamental details of fusion events includes the information of parental genes, junction sequence, expression levels of fusion transcripts, breakpoint coordinates, strand information, tissue type, treatment information, fusion type, PFusionDB ID, and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) ID. Further, two search modules: 'Simple Search' and 'Advanced Search', along with a 'Browse' option to data download, are present for the ease of users. Three distinct modules viz. 'BLASTN', 'SW Align', and 'Mapping' are also available for efficient query sequence mapping and alignment to FTs.

35776535,PHILM2Web: A high-throughput database of macromolecular host-pathogen interactions on the Web.,"During infection, the pathogen's entry into the host organism, breaching the host immune defense, spread and multiplication are frequently mediated by multiple interactions between the host and pathogen proteins. Systematic studying of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) is a challenging task for both experimental and computational approaches and is critically dependent on the previously obtained knowledge about these interactions found in the biomedical literature. While several HPI databases exist that manually filter HPI protein-protein interactions from the generic databases and curated experimental interactomic studies, no comprehensive database on HPIs obtained from the biomedical literature is currently available. Here, we introduce a high-throughput literature-mining platform for extracting HPI data that includes the most comprehensive to date collection of HPIs obtained from the PubMed abstracts. Our HPI data portal, PHILM2Web (Pathogen-Host Interactions by Literature Mining on the Web), integrates an automatically generated database of interactions extracted by PHILM, our high-precision HPI literature-mining algorithm. Currently, the database contains 23 581 generic HPIs between 157 host and 403 pathogen organisms from 11 609 abstracts. The interactions were obtained from processing 608 972 PubMed abstracts, each containing mentions of at least one host and one pathogen organisms. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we also utilized PHILM to process 25 796 PubMed abstracts obtained by the same query as the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset. This COVID-19 processing batch resulted in 257 HPIs between 19 host and 31 pathogen organisms from 167 abstracts. The access to the entire HPI dataset is available via a searchable PHILM2Web interface; scientists can also download the entire database in bulk for offline processing.

With the studies about miRNA increase in sugarcane, the researchers lack an exhaustive resource to achieve the data. To fill this gap, we developed MicroSugar, a database that supported mRNA and miRNA annotation for sugarcane (http://suc.gene-db.com). MicroSugar is an integrated resource developed for 194,528 genes including 80,746 unigenes from long reads of Pacbio platform and 468 miRNAs from 72 samples. Internode elongation (jointing) is the key biological characteristic for the growth of sugarcane tillers into sugarcane stems. The present study combined the sequencing data from the different stages in internode elongation of stem and tiller. In total, the 14,300 3' untranslated region (UTR) sequences were extracted from the gene sequences and 3019 mRNAs as target of 327 miRNA were identified by miRanda algorithm and Spearman's Rho of expression levels. To determine the gene functions regulated by these miRNAs, the gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed and it confirmed that the over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms were associated with organism formation indicating the growth controlling function by miRNAs in sugarcane. Moreover, MicroSugar is a comprehensive and integrated database with a user-friendly responsive template.

However, the functional interpretation of these variants remains challenging. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been widely used to identify mutations linked to disease, yet they explain only 20-50% of disease-related variants. Single-cell eQTLs (sc-eQTLs) studies provide an immense opportunity to identify new disease risk genes with expanded eQTL scales and transcriptional regulation at a much finer resolution. However, there is no comprehensive database dedicated to single-cell eQTLs that users can use to search, analyse and visualize them. Therefore, we developed the scQTLbase (http://bioinfo.szbl.ac.cn/scQTLbase), the first integrated human sc-eQTLs portal, featuring 304 datasets spanning 57 cell types and 95 cell states. It contains ∼16 million SNPs significantly associated with cell-type/state gene expression and ∼0.69 million disease-associated sc-eQTLs from 3 333 traits/diseases.

38365724,POSEIDON: Peptidic Objects SEquence-based Interaction with cellular DOmaiNs: a new database and predictor.,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short chains of amino acids that have shown remarkable potential to cross the cell membrane and deliver coupled therapeutic cargoes into cells. Designing and testing different CPPs to target specific cells or tissues is crucial to ensure high delivery efficiency and reduced toxicity. However, in vivo/in vitro testing of various CPPs can be both time-consuming and costly, which has led to interest in computational methodologies, such as Machine Learning (ML) approaches, as faster and cheaper methods for CPP design and uptake prediction. However, most ML models developed to date focus on classification rather than regression techniques, because of the lack of informative quantitative uptake values. To address these challenges, we developed POSEIDON, an open-access and up-to-date curated database that provides experimental quantitative uptake values for over 2,300 entries and physicochemical properties of 1,315 peptides. POSEIDON also offers physicochemical properties, such as cell line, cargo, and sequence, among others. By leveraging this database along with cell line genomic features, we processed a dataset of over 1,200 entries to develop an ML regression CPP uptake predictor. Our results demonstrated that POSEIDON accurately predicted peptide cell line uptake, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.87, Spearman correlation of 0.88, and r<sup>2</sup> score of 0.76, on an independent test set. With its comprehensive and novel dataset, along with its potent predictive capabilities, the POSEIDON database and its associated ML predictor signify a significant leap forward in CPP research and development.

35318332,"SkewDB, a comprehensive database of GC and 10 other skews for over 30,000 chromosomes and plasmids.","GC skew denotes the relative excess of G nucleotides over C nucleotides on the leading versus the lagging replication strand of eubacteria. While the effect is small, typically around 2.5%, it is robust and pervasive. GC skew and the analogous TA skew are a localized deviation from Chargaff's second parity rule, which states that G and C, and T and A occur with (mostly) equal frequency even within a strand. Different bacterial phyla show different kinds of skew, and differing relations between TA and GC skew. This article introduces an open access database ( https://skewdb.org ) of GC and 10 other skews for over 30,000 chromosomes and plasmids. Further details like codon bias, strand bias, strand lengths and taxonomic data are also included. The SkewDB can be used to generate or verify hypotheses.

35891795,FishExp: A comprehensive database and analysis platform for gene expression and alternative splicing of fish species.,"The publicly archived RNA-seq data has grown exponentially, while its valuable information has not yet been fully discovered and utilized, such as alternative splicing and its integration with gene expression. This is especially true for fish species which play important roles in ecology, research and the food industry. Furthermore, there is a lack of online platform to analyze users' new data individually and jointly with existing data for the comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing and gene expression. Here, we present FishExp, a web-based data platform covering gene expression and alternative splicing in 26,081 RNA-seq experiments from 44 fishes. It allows users to query the data in a variety of ways, including gene identifier/symbol, functional term, and BLAST alignment. Moreover, users can customize experiments and tools to perform differential/specific expression and alternative splicing analysis, co-expression and cross-species analysis. In addition, functional enrichment is provided to confer biological significance. Notably, users are allowed to submit their own data and perform various analyses using the new data alone or alongside existing data in FishExp. Results of retrieval and analysis can be visualized on the gene-, transcript- and splicing event-level webpage in a highly interactive and intuitive manner. All data in FishExp can be downloaded for more in-depth analysis.

35662455,The TissueNet v.3 Database: Protein-protein Interactions in Adult and Embryonic Human Tissue contexts.,"Tissue contexts are extremely valuable when studying protein functions and their associated phenotypes. Recently, the study of proteins in tissue contexts was greatly facilitated by the availability of thousands of tissue transcriptomes. To provide access to these data we developed the TissueNet integrative database that displays protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in tissue contexts. Through TissueNet, users can create tissue-sensitive network views of the PPI landscape of query proteins. Unlike other tools, TissueNet output networks highlight tissue-specific and broadly expressed proteins, as well as over- and under-expressed proteins per tissue. The TissueNet v.3 upgrade has a much larger dataset of proteins and PPIs, and represents 125 adult tissues and seven embryonic tissues. Thus, TissueNet provides an extensive, quantitative, and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins in adulthood and embryonic stages.

40348330,TopCysteineDB: A Cysteinome-wide Database Integrating Structural and Chemoproteomics Data for Cysteine Ligandability Prediction.,"Development of targeted covalent inhibitors and covalent ligand-first approaches have emerged as a powerful strategy in drug design, with cysteines being attractive targets due to their nucleophilicity and relative scarcity. While structural biology and chemoproteomics approaches have generated extensive data on cysteine ligandability, these complementary data types remain largely disconnected. Here, we present TopCysteineDB, a comprehensive resource integrating structural information from the PDB with chemoproteomics data from activity-based protein profiling experiments. Analysis of the complete PDB yielded 264,234 unique cysteines, while the proteomics dataset encompasses 41,898 detectable cysteines across the human proteome. Using TopCovPDB, an automated classification pipeline complemented by manual curation, we identified 787 covalent cysteines and systematically categorized other functional roles, including metal-binding, cofactor-binding, and disulfide bonds. Mapping residue-wise structural information to sequence space enabled cross-referencing between structural and proteomics data, creating a unified view of cysteine ligandability. For TopCySPAL, a machine learning model was developed, integrating structural features and proteomics data, achieving strong predictive performance (AUROC: 0.964, AUPRC: 0.914) and robust generalization to novel cases. TopCysteineDB and TopCySPAL are freely accessible through a webinterface, TopCysteineDBApp (https://topcysteinedb.hhu.de/), designed to facilitate exploration of cysteine sites across the human proteome. The interface provides an interactive visualization featuring a color-coded mapping of chemoproteomics data onto cysteine site structures and the highlighting of identified peptide sequences.

36350638,tatDB: a database of Ago1-mediated targets of transfer RNA fragments.,"tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are a class of emerging post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression likely binding to the transcripts of target genes. However, only a few tRFs targets have been experimentally validated, making it hard to extrapolate the functions or binding mechanisms of tRFs. The paucity of resources supporting the identification of the targets of tRFs creates a bottleneck in the fast-developing field. We have previously analyzed chimeric reads in crosslinked Argonaute1-RNA complexes to help infer the guide-target pairs and binding mechanisms of multiple tRFs based on experimental data in human HEK293 cells. To efficiently disseminate these results to the research community, we designed a web-based database tatDB (targets of tRFs DataBase) populated with close to 250 000 experimentally determined guide-target pairs with ∼23 000 tRF isoforms. tatDB has a user-friendly interface with flexible query options/filters allowing one to obtain comprehensive information on given tRFs (or targets). Modes of interactions are supported by secondary structures of potential guide-target hybrids and binding motifs, essential for understanding the targeting mechanisms of tRFs. Further, we illustrate the value of the database on an example of hypothesis-building for a tRFs potentially involved in the lifecycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. tatDB is freely accessible at https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb.",True,False,4.5,,,tatdb,16.0,ok,,targets of trfs database | argets of trfs database,,spacy,0.0,tatDB,True,6.0,True,True,https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb,https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb,True,...e SARS-CoV-2 virus. tatDB is freely accessible at https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb.,1

35842742,PlantPhoneDB: A manually curated pan-plant database of ligand-receptor pairs infers cell-cell communication.,"Ligand-receptor pairs play important roles in cell-cell communication for multicellular organisms in response to environmental cues. Recently, the emergence of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate cellular communication based on ligand-receptor expression. However, so far, no reliable ligand-receptor interaction database is available for plant species. In this study, we developed PlantPhoneDB (https://jasonxu.shinyapps.io/PlantPhoneDB/), a pan-plant database comprising a large number of high-confidence ligand-receptor pairs manually curated from seven resources. Also, we developed a PlantPhoneDB R package, which not only provided optional four scoring approaches that calculate interaction scores of ligand-receptor pairs between cell types but also provided visualization functions to present analysis results. At the PlantPhoneDB web interface, the processed datasets and results can be searched, browsed, and downloaded. To uncover novel cell-cell communication events in plants, we applied the PlantPhoneDB R package on GSE121619 dataset to infer significant cell-cell interactions of heat-shocked root cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. As a result, the PlantPhoneDB predicted the actively communicating AT1G28290-AT2G14890 ligand-receptor pair in atrichoblast-cortex cell pair in Arabidopsis thaliana. Importantly, the downstream target genes of this ligand-receptor pair were significantly enriched in the ribosome pathway, which facilitated plants adapting to environmental changes.

36350663,TEDD: a database of temporal gene expression patterns during multiple developmental periods in human and model organisms.,"Characterization of the specific expression and chromatin profiles of genes enables understanding how they contribute to tissue/organ development and the mechanisms leading to diseases. Whilst the number of single-cell sequencing studies is increasing dramatically; however, data mining and reanalysis remains challenging. Herein, we systematically curated the up-to-date and most comprehensive datasets of sequencing data originating from 2760 bulk samples and over 5.1 million single-cells from multiple developmental periods from humans and multiple model organisms. With unified and systematic analysis, we profiled the gene expression and chromatin accessibility among 481 cell-types, 79 tissue-types and 92 timepoints, and pinpointed cells with the co-expression of target genes. We also enabled the detection of gene(s) with a temporal and cell-type specific expression profile that is similar to or distinct from that of a target gene. Additionally, we illustrated the potential upstream and downstream gene-gene regulation interactions, particularly under the same biological process(es) or KEGG pathway(s). Thus, TEDD (Temporal Expression during Development Database), a value-added database with a user-friendly interface, not only enables researchers to identify cell-type/tissue-type specific and temporal gene expression and chromatin profiles but also facilitates the association of genes with undefined biological functions in development and diseases.

In this study, we present MolHyb, a web server for structure-based ligand design by molecular hybridization. The input of MolHyb is a protein file and a seed compound file. MolHyb tries to generate novel ligands through hybridizing the seed compound with helper compounds that bind to the same protein target or similar proteins. To facilitate the job of getting helper compounds, we compiled a modeled protein-ligand structure database as an extension to crystal structures in the PDB database by placing the bioactive compounds in ChEMBL into their corresponding 3D protein binding pocket properly. MolHyb works by searching for helper compounds from the protein-ligand structure database and migrating chemical moieties from helper compounds to the seed compound efficiently. Hybridization is performed at both cyclic and acyclic bonds. The users can also input their own helper compounds to MolHyb. We hope that MolHyb will be a useful tool for rational drug design.

Although gene profiling can identify their cancer-specific signatures, systematic correlations between protein functions and tumor-related mechanisms are still unclear. We present here the CrMP-Sol database ( https://bio-gateway.aigene.org.cn/g/CrMP ), which aims to breach the gap between the two. Machine learning was used to extract key functional descriptions for protein visualization in the 3D-space, where spatial distributions provide function-based predictive connections between proteins and cancer types. CrMP-Sol also presents QTY-enabled water-soluble designs to facilitate native membrane protein studies despite natural hydrophobicity.

The identification of gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns can provide valuable insights into ongoing biological processes, such as the cell cycle, cell development, circadian rhythms, or responses to external stimuli such as drug treatments or viral infections. However, currently, no database defines, identifies or archives gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns. Here, using a high-throughput regression analysis approach, eight linear and nonlinear parametric models were fitted to gene expression profiles from time-series experiments to identify eight types of gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns. We curated 2684 time-series transcriptome datasets and identified 2644,370 gene profiles exhibiting temporal-specific expression patterns. The results were stored in the database GeTeSEPdb (gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns database, http://www.inbirg.com/GeTeSEPdb/). Moreover, we implemented an online tool to identify gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns from user-submitted data. In summary, GeTeSEPdb is a comprehensive web service that can be used to identify and analyse gene profiles with temporal-specific expression patterns.

36367311,MGTdb: a web service and database for studying the global and local genomic epidemiology of bacterial pathogens.,"Multilevel genome typing (MGT) enables the genomic characterization of bacterial isolates and the relationships among them. The MGT system describes an isolate using multiple multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes, referred to as levels. Thus, for a new isolate, sequence types (STs) assigned at multiple precisely defined levels can be used to type isolates at multiple resolutions. The MGT designation for isolates is stable, and the assignment is faster than the existing approaches. MGT's utility has been demonstrated in multiple species. This paper presents a publicly accessible web service called MGTdb, which enables the assignment of MGT STs to isolates, along with their storage, retrieval and analysis. The MGTdb web service enables upload of genome data as sequence reads or alleles, which are processed and assigned MGT identifiers. Additionally, any newly sequenced isolates deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Sequence Read Archive are also regularly retrieved (currently daily), processed, assigned MGT identifiers and made publicly available in MGTdb. Interactive visualization tools are presented to assist analysis, along with capabilities to download publicly available isolates and assignments for use with external software. MGTdb is currently available for Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis and Vibrio cholerae. We demonstrate the usability of MGTdb through three case studies - to study the long-term national surveillance of S. Typhimurium, the local epidemiology and outbreaks of S. Typhimurium, and the global epidemiology of V. cholerae. Thus, MGTdb enables epidemiological and microbiological investigations at multiple levels of resolution for all publicly available isolates of these pathogens.

39316480,Subjective Quality Assessment of Compressed Tone-Mapped High Dynamic Range Videos.,"High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos are able to represent wider ranges of contrasts and colors than Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) videos, giving more vivid experiences. Due to this, HDR videos are expected to grow into the dominant video modality of the future. However, HDR videos are incompatible with existing SDR displays, which form the majority of affordable consumer displays on the market. Because of this, HDR videos must be processed by tone-mapping them to reduced bit-depths to service a broad swath of SDR-limited video consumers. Here, we analyze the impact of tone-mapping operators on the visual quality of streaming HDR videos. To this end, we built the first large-scale subjectively annotated open-source database of compressed tone-mapped HDR videos, containing 15,000 tone-mapped sequences derived from 40 unique HDR source contents. The videos in the database were labeled with more than 750,000 subjective quality annotations, collected from more than 1,600 unique human observers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new subjective database by benchmarking objective models of visual quality on it. We envision that the new LIVE Tone-Mapped HDR (LIVE-TMHDR) database will enable significant progress on HDR video tone mapping and quality assessment in the future.

Complementing the relatively meager number of experimental structures, AF2 provides 3D predictions for thousands of new alpha-helical membrane proteins. However, the lack of reliable structural templates and the fact that AF2 was not trained to handle phase boundaries also necessitates a delicate assessment of structural correctness.

Current R-loop databases provide only limited access to these data. Moreover, no web tools for analyzing user-supplied R-loop datasets have yet been described. In our recent work, we reprocessed 810 R-loop mapping samples, building the largest R-loop data resource to date. We also defined R-loop consensus regions and developed a framework for R-loop data analysis. Now, we introduce RLBase, a user-friendly database that provides the capability to (i) explore hundreds of public R-loop mapping datasets, (ii) explore R-loop consensus regions, (iii) analyze user-supplied data and (iv) download standardized and reprocessed datasets.

40234091,PCI-DB: a novel primary tissue immunopeptidome database to guide next-generation peptide-based immunotherapy development.,"<h4>Background</h4>Various cancer immunotherapies rely on the T cell-mediated recognition of peptide antigens presented on human leukocyte antigens (HLA). However, the identification and selection of naturally presented peptide targets for the development of personalized as well as off-the-shelf immunotherapy approaches remain challenging.<h4>Methods</h4>Over 10,000 raw mass spectrometry (MS) files from over 3,000 tissue samples were analyzed, summing to approximately seven terabytes of data. The raw MS data were processed using the standardized and open-source nf-core pipelines MHCquant2 and epitopeprediction, providing a uniform procedure for data handling. A global false discovery rate was applied to minimize false-positive identifications.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce the open-access Peptides for Cancer Immunotherapy Database (PCI-DB, https://pci-db.org/), a comprehensive resource of immunopeptidome data originating from various malignant and benign primary tissues that provides the research community with a convenient tool to facilitate the identification of peptide targets for immunotherapy development. The PCI-DB includes >6.6 million HLA class I and >3.4 million HLA class II peptides from over 40 tissue types and cancer entities. First application of the database provided insights into the representation of cancer-testis antigens across malignant and benign tissues, enabling the identification and characterization of cross-tumor entity and entity-specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as well as naturally presented neoepitopes from frequent cancer mutations. Further, we used the PCI-DB to design personalized peptide vaccines for two patients suffering from metastatic cancer. In a retrospective analysis, PCI-DB enabled the composition of both a multi-peptide vaccine comprising non-mutated, highly frequent TAAs matching the immunopeptidome of the individual patient's tumor and a neoepitope-based vaccine matching the mutational profile of a patient with cancer. Both vaccine approaches induced potent and long-lasting T-cell responses, accompanied by long-term survival of these patients with advanced cancer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The PCI-DB provides a highly versatile tool to broaden the understanding of cancer-related antigen presentation and, ultimately, supports the development of novel immunotherapies.",True,False,3.5,,,pci-db,16.0,ok,,peptides for cancer immunotherapy database,,spacy,0.0,PCI-DB,True,6.0,True,True,https://pci-db.org/,https://pci-db.org/,True,"...ptides for Cancer Immunotherapy Database (PCI-DB, https://pci-db.org/), a comprehensive resource of immunopeptidome dat...",1

The virus has gone numerous mutations to replicate faster, which can overwhelm the immune system of the host. Linear B-cell epitopes are becoming promising in prevention of various deadly infectious diseases, breaking the general idea of their low immunogenicity and partial protection. However, there is still no public repository to host the linear B-cell epitopes for facilitating the development vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we developed BCEDB, a linear B-cell epitopes database specifically designed for hosting, exploring and visualizing linear B-cell epitopes and their features. The database provides a comprehensive repository of computationally predicted linear B-cell epitopes from Spike protein; a systematic annotation of epitopes including sequence, antigenicity score, genomic locations of epitopes, mutations in different virus lineages, mutation sites on the 3D structure of Spike protein and a genome browser to visualize them in an interactive manner.

39431411,LukProt: A Database of Eukaryotic Predicted Proteins Designed for Investigations of Animal Origins.,"The origins and early evolution of animals are subjects with many outstanding questions. One problem faced by researchers trying to answer them is the absence of a comprehensive database with sequences from nonbilaterians. Publicly available data are plentiful but scattered and often not associated with proper metadata. A new database presented in this paper, LukProt, is an attempt at solving this issue. The database contains protein sequences obtained mostly from genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic studies and is an extension of EukProt (Richter DJ, Berney C, Strassert JFH, Poh Y-P, Herman EK, Muñoz-Gómez SA, Wideman JG, Burki F, de Vargas C. EukProt: a database of genome-scale predicted proteins across the diversity of eukaryotes. Peer Community J. 2022:2:e56. https://doi.org/10.24072/pcjournal.173). LukProt adopts the EukProt naming conventions and includes data from 216 additional animals. The database is associated with a taxonomic grouping (taxogroup) scheme suitable for studying early animal evolution. Minor updates to the database will contain species additions or metadata corrections, whereas major updates will synchronize LukProt to each new version of EukProt, and releases are permanently stored on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7089120).

37465397,ZooPathWeb: a comprehensive web resource for zoonotic pathogens.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Zoonotic pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, can be transmitted from animals to humans, causing a wide range of diseases that can vary from mild to life-threatening. These pathogens typically exhibit a broad host range, infecting domestic and/or wild animals, which serve as reservoirs of infection. Human infection can occur through direct contact with infected animals or their body fluids, consumption of contaminated food or water, or via bites from infected arthropod vectors. Understanding the epidemiological characteristics and population structure of zoonotic pathogens is of paramount importance for preventing and controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present ZooPathWeb, a comprehensive online resource for zoonotic pathogens. ZooPathWeb provides essential information on pathogens that are particularly relevant to public health and includes a literature collection organized by pathogen classification, such as lineage, host, country or region and publication year. Moreover, we have developed four web-based utility tools for this release: SeqNHandle, PaPhy-ML, TreeView and BLAST.

PubMed search displays ~ 146,000 studies on HLA reported from diverse locations. Currently, IPD-IMGT/HLA (Robinson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 48:D948-D955, 2019) database houses data on 28,320 HLA alleles. We developed an automated pipeline with a unified graphical user interface HLA-SPREAD that provides a structured information on SNPs, Populations, REsources, ADRs and Diseases information. Information on HLA was extracted from ~ 28 million PubMed abstracts extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Python scripts were used to mine and curate information on diseases, filter false positives and categorize to 24 tree hierarchical groups and named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithms followed by semantic analysis to infer HLA association(s). This resource from 109 countries and 40 ethnic groups provides interesting insights on: markers associated with allelic/haplotypic association in autoimmune, cancer, viral and skin diseases, transplantation outcome and ADRs for hypersensitivity.

CIDs are characterised by shared and disease-specific processes, which is reflected by partially overlapping genetic risk maps and pathogenic cells (e.g., T cells). Their pathogenesis involves a plethora of intracellular pathways. The translation of the research findings on CIDs molecular mechanisms into effective treatments is challenging and may explain the low remission rates despite modern targeted therapies. Modelling CID-related causal interactions as networks allows us to tackle the complexity at a systems level and improve our understanding of the interplay of key pathways. Here we report the construction, description, and initial applications of the SYSCID map (https://syscid.elixir-luxembourg.org/), a mechanistic causal interaction network covering the molecular crosstalk between IBD, RA and SLE. We demonstrate that the map serves as an interactive, graphical review of IBD, RA and SLE molecular mechanisms, and helps to understand the complexity of omics data.

Mouse models are a key resource for disentangling such effects, because they offer myriad tools for manipulating the genome in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, phenotypic data are often obtained using laboratory-specific protocols, resulting in self-contained datasets that are difficult to relate to one another for larger scale analyses. To enable meta-analyses of morphological variation, particularly in the craniofacial complex and brain, we created MusMorph, a database of standardized mouse morphology data spanning numerous genotypes and developmental stages, including E10.5, E11.5, E14.5, E15.5, E18.5, and adulthood. To standardize data collection, we implemented an atlas-based phenotyping pipeline that combines techniques from image registration, deep learning, and morphometrics.

Dysregulation of phase separation might result in pathological condensation or sequestration of biomolecules, leading to diseases. Thus, phase separation and phase separating factors may serve as drug targets for disease treatment. Nevertheless, such associations have not yet been integrated into phase separation-related databases. Therefore, based on MloDisDB, a database for membraneless organelle factor-disease associations previously developed by our lab, we constructed PhaSeDis, the phase separation-disease association database. We increased the number of phase separation entries from 52 to 185, and supplemented the evidence provided by the original articles verifying the phase separation nature of the factors. Moreover, we included the information of interacting small molecules with low-throughput or high-throughput evidence that might serve as potential drugs for phase separation entries. PhaSeDis strives to offer comprehensive descriptions of each entry, elucidating how phase separating factors induce pathological conditions via phase separation and the mechanisms by which small molecules intervene.

37678708,WebSTR: A Population-wide Database of Short Tandem Repeat Variation in Humans.,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) are consecutive repetitions of one to six nucleotide motifs. They are hypervariable due to the high prevalence of repeat unit insertions or deletions primarily caused by polymerase slippage during replication. Genetic variation at STRs has been shown to influence a range of traits in humans, including gene expression, cancer risk, and autism. Until recently STRs have been poorly studied since they pose significant challenges to bioinformatics analyses. Moreover, genome-wide analysis of STR variation in population-scale cohorts requires large amounts of data and computational resources. However, the recent advent of genome-wide analysis tools has resulted in multiple large genome-wide datasets of STR variation spanning nearly two million genomic loci in thousands of individuals from diverse populations. Here we present WebSTR, a database of genetic variation and other characteristics of genome-wide STRs across human populations. WebSTR is based on reference panels of more than 1.7 million human STRs created with state of the art repeat annotation methods and can easily be extended to include additional cohorts or species. It currently contains data based on STR genotypes for individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project, H3Africa, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project and colorectal cancer patients from the TCGA dataset. WebSTR is implemented as a relational database with programmatic access available through an API and a web portal for browsing data.

39530236,TranscriptDB: a transcript-centric database to study eukaryotic transcript conservation and evolution.,"Eukaryotic genes can encode multiple distinct transcripts through the alternative splicing (AS) of genes. Interest in the AS mechanism and its evolution across different species has stimulated numerous studies, leading to several databases that provide information on AS and transcriptome data across multiple eukaryotic species. However, existing resources do not offer information on transcript conservation and evolution between genes of multiple species. Similarly to genes, identifying conserved transcripts-those from homologous genes that have retained a similar exon composition-is useful for determining transcript homology relationships, studying transcript functions and reconstructing transcript phylogenies. To address this gap, we have developed TranscriptDB, a database dedicated to studying the conservation and evolution of transcripts within gene families. TranscriptDB offers an extensive catalog of conserved transcripts and phylogenies for 317 annotated eukaryotic species, sourced from Ensembl database version 111. It serves multiple purposes, including the exploration of gene and transcript evolution. Users can access TranscriptDB through various browsing and querying tools, including a user-friendly web interface. The incorporated web servers enable users to retrieve information on transcript evolution using their own data as input.

Recently, gut microbiota is in the spotlight of new research on psychiatric disorders, as emerging discoveries have highlighted the importance of gut microbiome in the regulation of central nervous system via mediating the gut-brain-axis bidirectional communication. While metagenomics studies have accumulated for psychiatric disorders, few systematic efforts were dedicated to integrating these high-throughput data across diverse phenotypes, interventions, geographical regions, and biological species. To present a panoramic view of global data and provide a comprehensive resource for investigating the gut microbiota dysbiosis in psychiatric disorders, we developed the PsycGM, a manually curated and well-annotated database that provides the literature-supported associations between gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders or intervention measures. In total, PsycGM incorporated 559 studies from 31 countries worldwide, encompassing research involving humans, rats, mice, and non-human primates. PsycGM documented 8907 curated associations between 1514 gut microbial taxa and 11 psychiatric disorders, as well as 4050 associations between 869 taxa and 232 microbiota-based and non-microbiota-based interventions. Moreover, PsycGM provided a user-friendly web interface with comprehensive information, enabling browsing, retrieving and downloading of all entries. In the application of PsycGM, we panoramically depicted the intestinal microecological imbalance in depression. Additionally, we identified 9 microbial taxa consistently altered in patients with depression, with the most common dysregulations observed for Parabacteroides, Alistipes, and Faecalibacterium; in animal models of depression, consistent changes were observed in 21 microbial taxa, most frequently reported as Helicobacter, Lactobacillus, Roseburia, and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes.

35876977,FEAMR: A Database for Surveillance of Food and Environment-Associated Antimicrobial Resistance.,"The rapid dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a serious health problem on an unprecedented global scale. AMR is predicted to kill more than 10 million people annually by 2050 leading to huge economic losses worldwide. Therefore, urgent action is required at the national as well as international levels to avert this looming crisis. Effective surveillance can play an important role in the containment of AMR spread by providing data to help determine AMR hotspots, predict an outbreak, maintain proper stewardship and propose immediate and future plans of action in this respect. Although many existing databases provide genetic and molecular information on AMR in microorganisms, there is no dedicated database of AMR from non-clinical samples. The FEAMR database is a one-of-its-kind database to provide manually collated and curated information on the prevalence of AMR in food and the environment. For designing the FEAMR webpage, Microsoft Visual Studio with HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, Bootstrap for the front-end and C# for the back-end were used. The FEAMR database is a free access resource ( https://feamrudbt-amrlab.mu.ac.in/ ), accepting verified food- and environment-related AMR submissions from across the globe. To the best of our knowledge, it is probably the first database providing AMR-related surveillance data from non-clinical samples. It is designed from the 'One Health Approach' perspective to help in the containment of global AMR spread. Flowsheet of steps for making FEAMR database 1. Research articles relating to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) were searched on the internet. 2. Data relating to AMR were retrieved from these articles and stored in an MS-Excel sheet. 3. The web pages of the FEAMR database (DB) were created using Microsoft Visual Studio (MVS) and its various tools. HTML, CSS, ASP.NET and Bootstrap were used for the front end and C# used for the back-end of the website. 4.

36483202,Mr.Vc v2: An updated version of database with increased data of transcriptome and experimental validated interactions.,"Mr.Vc is a database of curated <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> transcriptome data and annotated information. The main objective is to facilitate the accessibility and reusability of the rapidly growing <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> omics data and relevant annotation. To achieve these goals, we performed manual curation on the transcriptome data and organized the datasets in an experiment-centric manner. We collected unknown operons annotated through text-mining analysis that would provide more clues about how <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> modulates gene regulation. Meanwhile, to understand the relationship between genes or experiments, we performed gene co-expression analysis and experiment-experiment correlation analysis. In additional, functional module named ""Interactions"" which dedicates to collecting experimentally validated interactions about <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> from public databases, MEDLINE documents and literature in life science journals. To date, Mr.Vc v2, which is significantly increased from the previous version, contains 107 microarray experiments, 106 RNA-seq experiments, and 3 Tn-seq projects, covering 56,839 entries of DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) from transcriptomes and 7,463 related genes from Tn-seq, respectively. and a total of 270,129 gene co-expression entries and 11,990 entries of experiment-experiment correlation was obtained, in total 1,316 entries of interactions were collected, including 496 protein-chemical signaling molecule interactions, 472 protein-protein interactions, 306 TF (Transcription Factor)-gene interactions and 42 <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>-virus interactions, most of which obtained from 402 literature through text-mining analysis.

In this context, we developed OrthoMaM, a database of ORTHOlogous MAmmalian Markers describing the evolutionary dynamics of coding sequences in mammalian genomes. OrthoMaM version 12 includes 15,868 alignments of orthologous coding sequences (CDS) from the 190 complete mammalian genomes currently available. All annotations and 1-to-1 orthology assignments are based on NCBI. Orthologous CDS can be mined for potential informative markers at the different taxonomic levels of the mammalian tree. To this end, several evolutionary descriptors of DNA sequences are provided for querying purposes (e.g. base composition and relative substitution rate). The graphical web interface allows the user to easily browse and sort the results of combined queries. The corresponding multiple sequence alignments and ML trees, inferred using state-of-the art approaches, are available for download both at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. OrthoMaM v12 can be used by researchers interested either in reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships of mammalian taxa or in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of coding sequences in their genomes.

MINRbase provides interactive access to the profiles of 130 238 expressed rRFs arising from the four human nuclear rRNAs (18S, 5.8S, 28S, 5S), two mitochondrial rRNAs (12S, 16S) or four spacers of 45S pre-rRNA. We compiled these profiles by analyzing 11 632 datasets, including the GEUVADIS and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repositories. MINRbase offers a user-friendly interface that lets researchers issue complex queries based on one or more criteria, such as parental rRNA identity, nucleotide sequence, rRF minimum abundance and metadata keywords (e.g. tissue type, disease). A 'summary' page for each rRF provides a granular breakdown of its expression by tissue type, disease, sex, ancestry and other variables; it also allows users to create publication-ready plots at the click of a button. MINRbase has already allowed us to generate support for three novel observations: the internal spacers of 45S are prolific producers of abundant rRFs; many abundant rRFs straddle the known boundaries of rRNAs; rRF production is regimented and depends on 'personal attributes' (sex, ancestry) and 'context' (tissue type, tissue state, disease).

34664666,ASMdb: a comprehensive database for allele-specific DNA methylation in diverse organisms.,"DNA methylation is known to be the most stable epigenetic modification and has been extensively studied in relation to cell differentiation, development, X chromosome inactivation and disease. Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) is a well-established mechanism for genomic imprinting and regulates imprinted gene expression. Previous studies have confirmed that certain special regions with ASM are susceptible and closely related to human carcinogenesis and plant development. In addition, recent studies have proven ASM to be an effective tumour marker. However, research on the functions of ASM in diseases and development is still extremely scarce. Here, we collected 4400 BS-Seq datasets and 1598 corresponding RNA-Seq datasets from 47 species, including human and mouse, to establish a comprehensive ASM database. We obtained the data on DNA methylation level, ASM and allele-specific expressed genes (ASEGs) and further analysed the ASM/ASEG distribution patterns of these species. In-depth ASM distribution analysis and differential methylation analysis conducted in nine cancer types showed results consistent with the reported changes in ASM in key tumour genes and revealed several potential ASM tumour-related genes.

However, collecting enough cells with the desired molecular phenotype in a single experiment is challenging, requiring several samples preprocessing steps to filter and collect the desired cells experimentally before sequencing. Data integration of multiple public single-cell experiments stands as a solution for this problem, allowing the collection of enough cells exhibiting the desired molecular signatures. By increasing the sample size of the desired cell type, this approach enables a robust cell type transcriptome characterization.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce rPanglaoDB, an R package to download and merge the uniformly processed and annotated scRNA-seq data provided by the PanglaoDB database. To show the potential of rPanglaoDB for collecting rare cell types by integrating multiple public datasets, we present a biological application collecting and characterizing a set of 157 fibrocytes. Fibrocytes are a rare monocyte-derived cell type, that exhibits both the inflammatory features of macrophages and the tissue remodeling properties of fibroblasts. This constitutes the first fibrocytes' unbiased transcriptome profile report. We compared the transcriptomic profile of the fibrocytes against the fibroblasts collected from the same tissue samples and confirm their associated relationship with healing processes in tissue damage and infection through the activation of the prostaglandin biosynthesis and regulation pathway.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>rPanglaoDB is implemented as an R package available through the CRAN repositories https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB.",True,False,5.0,,rpanglaodb | panglaodb,,16.0,conflict,,an r package to download and merge labeled single-cell rna-seq data from the panglaodb database. <h4>motivation</h4>characterizing cells with rare molecular phenotypes is one of the promises of high throughput single-cell rna sequencing | https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpanglaodb,cran,spacy,0.0,rPanglaoDB,True,6.0,False,False,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB,https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB,True,...R package available through the CRAN repositories https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPanglaoDB.,1

The database was developed by extracting data from pharmacological reviews of repeat-dose, carcinogenicity, developmental, and reproductive toxicity studies. In the database, observed and no-observed effects are linked to the respective effect levels, including information on severity/incidence and transiency/reversibility. It also includes some information on effects in humans, that were extracted from relevant sections of standard product labels of the approved drugs. The database is complemented with a specific ontology for reporting effects that was developed as an improved version of the Ontology Lookup Service's mammalian and human phenotype ontologies and includes different hierarchical levels. The developed ontology contains novel and unique standardized terms, including ontological terms for reproductive and endocrine effects. The database aims to facilitate correlation and concordance analyses based on the link between observed and no-observed effects and their respective effect levels. In addition, it offers a robust dataset on drug information for the pharmaceutical industry and research. The reported ontology supports the analyses of toxicological information, especially for reproductive and endocrine endpoints and can be used to encode legacy data or develop additional ontologies.

39514415,athisomiRDB: A comprehensive database of Arabidopsis isomiRs.,"Several pieces of evidence challenge the traditional view of miRNAs as static molecules, revealing dynamic isomiRs originating from each miRNA precursor arm. In plants, isomiRs, which result from imprecise cleavage during pre-miRNA processing and post-transcriptional alterations, serve as crucial regulators of target microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite numerous studies on Arabidopsis miRNAs, the systematic identification and annotation of isomiRs across various tissues and conditions remain limited. Due to the lack of systematically collected isomiR information, we introduce the athisomiRDB database, which houses 20 764 isomiRs from Arabidopsis small RNA-sequencing (sRNA-seq) libraries. It comprises >2700 diverse samples and allows exploration at the sample, miRNA, or isomiR levels, offering insights into the presence or absence of isomiRs. The athisomiRDB includes exclusive and ambiguous isomiRs, each with features such as transcriptional origin, variant-containing isomiRs, and identifiers for frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the 1001 Genomes Project. It also provides 3' nontemplated post-transcriptional additions, isomiR-target interactions, and trait associations for each isomiR. We anticipate that athisomiRDB will play a pivotal role in unraveling the regulatory nature of the Arabidopsis miRNAome and enhancing sRNA research by leveraging isomiR profiles from extensive sRNA-seq datasets.

38957398,KLSD: a kinase database focused on ligand similarity and diversity.,"Due to the similarity and diversity among kinases, small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) often display multi-target effects or selectivity, which have a strong correlation with the efficacy and safety of these inhibitors. However, due to the limited number of well-known popular databases and their restricted data mining capabilities, along with the significant scarcity of databases focusing on the pharmacological similarity and diversity of SMIKIs, researchers find it challenging to quickly access relevant information. The KLIFS database is representative of specialized application databases in the field, focusing on kinase structure and co-crystallised kinase-ligand interactions, whereas the KLSD database in this paper emphasizes the analysis of SMKIs among all reported kinase targets. To solve the current problem of the lack of professional application databases in kinase research and to provide centralized, standardized, reliable and efficient data resources for kinase researchers, this paper proposes a research program based on the ChEMBL database. It focuses on kinase ligands activities comparisons. This scheme extracts kinase data and standardizes and normalizes them, then performs kinase target difference analysis to achieve kinase activity threshold judgement. It then constructs a specialized and personalized kinase database platform, adopts the front-end and back-end separation technology of SpringBoot architecture, constructs an extensible WEB application, handles the storage, retrieval and analysis of the data, ultimately realizing data visualization and interaction. This study aims to develop a kinase database platform to collect, organize, and provide standardized data related to kinases.

Biological functions in organisms are often accomplished through protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which help to regulate interacting proteins or organize them into an integral machine. However, the study of PPIs in cyanobacteria falls far behind that in mammals and has not been integrated for ease of use. Thus, we built CyanoMapDB (http://www.cyanomapdb.msbio.pro/), a database providing cyanobacterial PPIs with experimental evidence, consisting of 52,304 PPIs among 6,789 proteins from 23 cyanobacterial species.

Because of the popularity of next-generation sequencing, obtaining the whole-genome sequence of a bacterium is easy. Several genome-based typing methods are available, and core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) is the most recognized methods. Using cgMLST typing to compare L. monocytogenes whole-genome sequences (WGS) with those obtained across distinct regions is beneficial.

Chimeric GPCRs have emerged as valuable tools for elucidating GPCR function by facilitating the identification of signaling pathways, resolving structures, and discovering novel ligands of poorly understood GPCRs. Such chimeric GPCRs are obtained by merging a well- and less-well-characterized GPCR at the intracellular limits of their transmembrane regions or intracellular loops, leveraging knowledge transfer from the well-characterized GPCR. However, despite the engineering of over 200 chimeric GPCRs to date, the design process remains largely trial-and-error and lacks a standardized approach. To address this gap, we introduce GPCRchimeraDB (https://www.bio2byte.be/gpcrchimeradb/), the first comprehensive database dedicated to chimeric GPCRs.

Recently, phage peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs)-derived antimicrobial peptides were proposed as new antibacterial agents against multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, there is still a lack of methods for mining antimicrobial peptides based on phages or phage PGHs.

40186419,mirTarCLASH: a comprehensive miRNA target database based on chimeric read-based experiments.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can target messenger RNAs to control their degradation or translation repression effects. Therefore, identifying the target and binding sites of different miRNAs is essential for understanding miRNA functions. To investigate these interactions, researchers have employed the cross-linking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH-seq) and similar CLASH-like approaches to generate chimeric reads formed by miRNAs and their targeting segments. These chimeric reads allow for the direct extraction of both the miRNA-target gene pairs and their corresponding binding sites. Nevertheless, these studies lack user-friendly platforms for researchers to investigate these interactions efficiently, thus hindering scientists' ability to explore miRNA functions. To address this gap, we developed mirTarCLASH, a comprehensive database that deposits 502 061/322 707/224 452 unique hybrid reads from human/mouse/worm miRNA chimeric read-based experiments. In mirTarCLASH, the chimera analysis algorithm ChiRA and two distinct binding site inference tools, RNAup and miRanda, were adopted to facilitate the exploration of miRNA-target pairs derived from CLASH-like experiments. Compared with existing similar repositories, mirTarCLASH further enables several confidence evaluation filters with visualization functions for the extracted results. The results can be further refined based on the key properties of the miRNA targeting sites, including read depths, numbers of supporting algorithms, and cross-linking-induced mutations, to enhance confidence levels. In addition, these miRNA-binding sites are visually represented through an integrated transcript atlas.

35779245,dbBIP: a comprehensive bipolar disorder database for genetic research.,"Bipolar disorder (BIP) is one of the most common hereditary psychiatric disorders worldwide. Elucidating the genetic basis of BIP will play a pivotal role in mechanistic delineation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully reported multiple susceptibility loci conferring BIP risk, thus providing insight into the effects of its underlying pathobiology. However, difficulties remain in the extrication of important and biologically relevant data from genetic discoveries related to psychiatric disorders such as BIP. There is an urgent need for an integrated and comprehensive online database with unified access to genetic and multi-omics data for in-depth data mining. Here, we developed the dbBIP, a database for BIP genetic research based on published data. The dbBIP consists of several modules, i.e.: (i) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) module, containing large-scale GWAS genetic summary statistics and functional annotation information relevant to risk variants; (ii) gene module, containing BIP-related candidate risk genes from various sources and (iii) analysis module, providing a simple and user-friendly interface to analyze one's own data. We also conducted extensive analyses, including functional SNP annotation, integration (including summary-data-based Mendelian randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies), co-expression, gene expression, tissue expression, protein-protein interaction and brain expression quantitative trait loci analyses, thus shedding light on the genetic causes of BIP. Finally, we developed a graphical browser with powerful search tools to facilitate data navigation and access.

Long-term and chronic exposure to high concentrations of air pollutants is associated with deleterious effects on vital organs, including increased inflammation in the lungs, oxidative stress in the heart and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. For this reason, in an effort to find an association between exposure to pollutants and the toxicological effects observable on human health, an online resource collecting and characterizing in detail pollutant molecules could be helpful to investigate their properties and mechanisms of action. We developed a database, APDB, collecting air-pollutant-related data from different online resources, in particular, molecules from the US Environmental Protection Agency, their associated targets and bioassays found in the PubChem chemical repository and their computed molecular descriptors and quantum mechanics properties. A web interface allows (i) to browse data by category, (ii) to navigate the database by querying molecules and targets and (iii) to visualize and download molecule and target structures as well as computed descriptors and similarities.

37221043,RNA-Chrom: a manually curated analytical database of RNA-chromatin interactome.,"Every year there is more and more evidence that non-coding RNAs play an important role in biological processes affecting various levels of organization of living systems: from the cellular (regulation of gene expression, remodeling and maintenance of chromatin structure, co-transcriptional suppression of transposons, splicing, post-transcriptional RNA modifications, etc.) to cell populations and even organismal ones (development, aging, cancer, cardiovascular and many other diseases). The development and creation of mutually complementary databases that will aggregate, unify and structure different types of data can help to reach the system level of studying non-coding RNAs. Here we present the RNA-Chrom manually curated analytical database, which contains the coordinates of billions of contacts of thousands of human and mouse RNAs with chromatin. Through the user-friendly web interface (https://rnachrom2.bioinf.fbb.msu.ru/), two approaches to the analysis of the RNA-chromatin interactome were implemented. Firstly, to find out whether the RNA of interest to a user contacts with chromatin, and if so, with which genes or DNA loci? Secondly, to find out which RNAs are in contact with the DNA locus of interest to a user (and probably participate in its regulation), and if there are such, what is the nature of their interaction?

35254998,MDADP: A Webserver Integrating Database and Prediction Tools for Microbe-Disease Associations.,"More and more evidence has demonstrated that microbiota play important roles in the life processes of the human body. In recent years, various computational methods have been proposed for identifying potentially disease-associated microbes to save costs in traditional biological experiments. However, prediction performances of these methods are generally limited by outdated and incomplete datasets. And moreover, until now, there are limited studies that can provide visual predictive tools for inferring possible microbe-disease associations (MDAs) as well. Hence, in this manuscript, a novel webserver called MDADP will be proposed to identify latent MDAs, in which, a new MDA database together with interactive prediction tools for MDAs studies will be designed simultaneously. Especially, in the newly constructed MDA database, 2019 known MDAs between 58 diseases and 703 microbes have been manually collected first. And then, through adopting the average ranking method and the co-confidence method respectively, eight representative computational models have been integrated together to identify potential disease-related microbes. As a result, MDADP can provide not only interactive features for users to access and capture MDAs entities, but alsoeffective tools for users to identify candidate microbes for different diseases. To our knowledge, MDADP is the first online platform that incorporates a new MDA database with comprehensive MDA prediction tools. Therefore, we believe that it will be a valuable source of information for researches in microbiology and disease-related fields.

The main specificity of this database is to include a significant fraction of spectra of unprocessed rock, which are more realistic analogs and often have different spectral features than the fine powders more commonly analyzed in reflectance spectroscopy. Additionally, these measurements were acquired with a spectrometer whose spot size is similar to those of the SuperCam instrument (Mars 2020 mission) at a few meters from a target. Supplementary information are provided in the ROMA database: higher-level data (such as absorption band parameters) as well as sample mineralogy estimated by whole-rock X-ray diffraction analyses.

Herein, we present StreptomeDB 4.0, a substantial update of the database that includes expanded content and several new features. Currently, StreptomeDB 4.0 contains over 8500 NPs originating from ∼3900 streptomycetes, manually annotated from ∼7600 PubMed-indexed peer-reviewed articles. The database was enhanced by two in-house developments: (i) automated literature-mined NP-protein relationships (hyperlinked to the CPRiL web server) and (ii) pharmacophore-based NP-protein interactions (predicted with the ePharmaLib dataset). Moreover, genome mining was supplemented through hyperlinks to the widely used antiSMASH database. To facilitate NP structural dereplication, interactive visualization tools were implemented, namely the JSpecView applet and plotly.js charting library for predicted nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectral data, respectively. Furthermore, both the backend database and the frontend web interface were redesigned, and several software packages, including PostgreSQL and Django, were updated to the latest versions. Overall, this comprehensive database serves as a vital resource for researchers seeking to delve into the metabolic intricacies of streptomycetes and discover novel therapeutics, notably antimicrobial agents.

37499897,INTERPIN: A repository for intrinsic transcription termination hairpins in bacteria.,"The large-scale detection of putative intrinsic transcription terminators is limited to only a few bacteria currently. We discovered a group of hairpins, called cluster hairpins, present within 15 nucleotides from each other. These are expected to work in tandem to cause intrinsic transcription termination (ITT), while the single hairpin can do the same alone. Therefore, exploring these ITT sites and the hairpins across bacterial genomes becomes highly desirable. INTERPIN is the largest archived collection of in silico inferred ITT hairpins in bacteria, covering 12745 bacterial genomes and encompassing ten bacterial phyla for ∼25 million hairpins. Users can obtain details on operons, individual cluster, and single ITT hairpins that were screened therein. Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) software interactively visualizes hairpin secondary and tertiary structures in the genomic context. We also discuss statistics for the occurrence of cluster or single hairpins and other termination alternatives while showing the validation of predicted hairpins against in vivo detected hairpins. The database is freely available at http://pallab.cds.iisc.ac.in/INTERPIN/.

These endeavors have yielded a substantial reservoir of potential data pertaining to metabolic biomarkers linked to the virus. Despite these strides, a comprehensive and meticulously structured database housing these crucial biomarkers remains absent. In this study, we developed MetaboliteCOVID, a manually curated database of COVID-19-related metabolite markers. The database currently comprises 665 manually selected entries of significantly altered metabolites associated with early diagnosis, disease severity, prognosis, and drug response in COVID-19, encompassing 337 metabolites. Additionally, the database offers a user-friendly interface, containing abundant information for querying, browsing, and analyzing COVID-19-related abnormal metabolites in different body fluids.

36222201,KinMod database: a tool for investigating metabolic regulation.,"The ability of current kinetic models to simulate the phenotypic behaviour of cells is limited since cell metabolism is regulated at different levels including enzyme regulation. The small molecule regulation network (SMRN) enables cells to respond rapidly to environmental fluctuations by controlling the activity of enzymes in metabolic pathways. However, SMRN is not as well studied relative to metabolic networks. The main contributor to the lack of knowledge on this regulatory system is the sparsity of experimental data and the absence of a standard framework for representing available information. In this paper, we introduce the KinMod database that encompasses more than 2 million data points on the metabolism and metabolic regulation network of 9814 organisms KinMod database employs a hierarchical data structure to: (i) signify relationships between kinetic information obtained through in-vitro experiments and proteins, with an emphasis on SMRN, (ii) provide a thorough insight into available kinetic parameters and missing experimental measurements of this regulatory network and (iii) facilitate machine learning approaches for parameter estimation and accurate kinetic model construction by providing a homogeneous list of linked omics data. The hierarchical ontology of the KinMod database allows flexible exploration of data attributes and investigation of metabolic relationships within- and cross-species. Identifying missing experimental values suggests additional experiments required for kinetic parameter estimation. Linking multi-omics data and providing data on SMRN encourages the development of novel machine learning techniques for predicting missing kinetic parameters and promotes accurate kinetic model construction of cells metabolism by providing a comprehensive list of available kinetic measurements. To illustrate the value of KinMod data, we develop six analyses to visualize associations between data classes belonging to separate sections of the metabolism. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that the KinMod database provides a unique framework for biologists and engineers to retrieve, evaluate and compare the functional metabolism of species, including the regulatory network, and discover the extent of available and missing experimental values of the metabolic regulation.

35222846,SuPepMem: A database of innate immune system peptides and their cell membrane interactions.,"Host defense peptides (HDPs) are short cationic peptides that play a key role in the innate immune response of all living organisms. Their action mechanism does not depend on the presence of protein receptors, but on their ability to target and disrupt the membranes of a wide range of pathogenic and pathologic cells which are recognized by their specific compositions, typically with a relatively high concentration of anionic lipids. Lipid profile singularities have been found in cancer, inflammation, bacteria, viral infections, and even in senescent cells, enabling the possibility to use them as therapeutic targets and/or diagnostic biomarkers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are extraordinarily well suited to explore how HDPs interact with membrane models, providing a large amount of qualitative and quantitative information that, nowadays, cannot be assessed by wet-lab methods at the same level of temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we present SuPepMem, an open-access repository containing MD simulations of different natural and artificial peptides with potential membrane lysis activity, interacting with membrane models of healthy mammal, bacteria, viruses, cancer or senescent cells. In addition to a description of the HDPs and the target systems, SuPepMem provides both the input files necessary to run the simulations and also the results of some selected analyses, including structural and MD-based quantitative descriptors. These descriptors are expected to be useful to train machine learning algorithms that could contribute to design new therapeutic peptides. Tools for comparative analysis between different HDPs and model membranes, as well as to restrict the queries to structural and time-averaged properties are also available. SuPepMem is a living project, that will continuously grow with more simulations including peptides of different sequences, MD simulations with different number of peptide units, more membrane models and also several resolution levels.

38483315,PMechDB: A Public Database of Elementary Polar Reaction Steps.,"Most online chemical reaction databases are not publicly accessible or are fully downloadable. These databases tend to contain reactions in noncanonicalized formats and often lack comprehensive information regarding reaction pathways, intermediates, and byproducts. Within the few publicly available databases, reactions are typically stored in the form of unbalanced, overall transformations with minimal interpretability of the underlying chemistry. These limitations present significant obstacles to data-driven applications including the development of machine learning models. As an effort to overcome these challenges, we introduce PMechDB, a publicly accessible platform designed to curate, aggregate, and share polar chemical reaction data in the form of elementary reaction steps. Our initial version of PMechDB consists of over 100,000 such steps. In the PMechDB, all reactions are stored as canonicalized and balanced elementary steps, featuring accurate atom mapping and arrow-pushing mechanisms. As an online interactive database, PMechDB provides multiple interfaces that enable users to search, download, and upload chemical reactions. We anticipate that the public availability of PMechDB and its standardized data representation will prove beneficial for chemoinformatics research and education and the development of data-driven, interpretable models for predicting reactions and pathways.

Uncovering biomarkers that are unique to EOCRC is of great importance to facilitate the prevention and detection of this growing cancer subtype. Although efforts have been made in the data curation about CRC, there is no integrated platform that gives access to data specifically related to young CRC patients. Here, we constructed a user-friendly open integrated resource called CRCDB (URL: http://crcdb-hust.com) which contains multi-omics data of 785 EOCRC, 4898 late-onset CRCs (LOCRC), and 1110 normal control samples from tissue, whole blood, platelets, and serum exosomes. CRCDB manages the differential analysis, survival analysis, co-expression analysis, and immune cell infiltration comparison analysis results in different CRC groups. Meta-analysis results were also provided for users for further data interpretation. Using the resource in CRCDB, we identified that genes associated with the metabolic process were less expressed in EOCRC patients, while up regulated genes most associated with the mitosis process might play an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of LOCRC. Survival-related genes were most enriched in oxidoreduction pathways in EOCRC while in immune-related pathways in LOCRC. With all the data gathered and processed, we anticipate that CRCDB could be a practical data mining platform to help explore potential applications of omics data and develop effective prevention and therapeutic strategies for the specific group of CRC patients.",True,False,4.0,,,crcdb,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,CRCDB,True,6.0,True,True,http://crcdb-hust.com,http://crcdb-hust.com,True,"...endly open integrated resource called CRCDB (URL: http://crcdb-hust.com) which contains multi-omics data of 785 EOCRC, 48...",1

40400345,3-D substructure search by transitive closure in AlphaFold database.,"Identifying structural relationships between proteins is crucial for understanding their functions and evolutionary histories. We present ISS_ProtSci, a Python package designed for structural similarity searches within the AlphaFold Database v2 (AFDB2). ISS_ProtSci incorporates DaliLite to identify geometrically similar structures and uses a transitive closure algorithm to iteratively explore neighboring shells of proteins. The precomputed all-against-all comparisons generated by Foldseek, chosen for its speed, are validated by DaliLite for precision. Search results are annotated with metadata from UniProtKB and Pfam protein family classifications, using hmmsearch to identify protein domains. Outputs, including Dali pairwise alignment data, are provided in TSV format for easy filtering and analysis. Our method offers a significant improvement in recall over existing tools like Foldseek, especially in detecting more distantly related proteins. This is particularly valuable in structurally diverse protein families where traditional sequence-based or fast structural methods struggle. ISS_ProtSci delivers practical runtimes and flexibility, allowing users to input a PDB file, define the minimum size of the common core, and evaluate results using Pfam clans. In evaluating our method across 12 test cases based on Pfam clans, we achieved over 99% recall of relevant proteins, even in challenging cases where Foldseek's recall dropped below 50%.

Pathway maps are the primary dataset in KEGG representing systemic functions of the cell and the organism in terms of molecular interaction and reaction networks. The KEGG Orthology (KO) system is a mechanism for linking genes and proteins to pathway maps and other molecular networks. Each KO is a generic gene identifier and each pathway map is created as a network of KO nodes. This architecture enables KEGG pathway mapping to uncover systemic features from KO assigned genomes and metagenomes. Additional roles of KOs include characterization of conserved genes and conserved units of genes in organism groups, which can be done by taxonomy mapping. A new tool has been developed for identifying conserved gene orders in chromosomes, in which gene orders are treated as sequences of KOs. Furthermore, a new dataset called VOG (virus ortholog group) is computationally generated from virus proteins and expanded to proteins of cellular organisms, allowing gene orders to be compared as VOG sequences as well.

A common approach to phylogenomics is to extract related genes from each organism, build a multiple sequence alignment and then reconstruct evolution relations through a phylogenetic tree. Often a set of highly conserved genes occurring in single-copy, called core genes, are used for this analysis, as they allow efficient automation within a taxonomic clade. Here we introduce the Universal Fungal Core Genes (UFCG) database and pipeline for genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of fungi. The UFCG database consists of 61 curated fungal marker genes, including a novel set of 41 computationally derived core genes and 20 canonical genes derived from literature, as well as marker gene sequences extracted from publicly available fungal genomes.

The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions-both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface.

37730114,HPC-Atlas: Computationally Constructing A Comprehensive Atlas of Human Protein Complexes.,"A fundamental principle of biology is that proteins tend to form complexes to play important roles in the core functions of cells. For a complete understanding of human cellular functions, it is crucial to have a comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes. Unfortunately, we still lack such a comprehensive atlas of experimentally validated protein complexes, which prevents us from gaining a complete understanding of the compositions and functions of human protein complexes, as well as the underlying biological mechanisms. To fill this gap, we built Human Protein Complexes Atlas (HPC-Atlas), as far as we know, the most accurate and comprehensive atlas of human protein complexes available to date. We integrated two latest protein interaction networks, and developed a novel computational method to identify nearly 9000 protein complexes, including many previously uncharacterized complexes. Compared with the existing methods, our method achieved outstanding performance on both testing and independent datasets. Furthermore, with HPC-Atlas we identified 751 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-affected human protein complexes, and 456 multifunctional proteins that contain many potential moonlighting proteins. These results suggest that HPC-Atlas can serve as not only a computing framework to effectively identify biologically meaningful protein complexes by integrating multiple protein data sources, but also a valuable resource for exploring new biological findings.

37468182,D-ORB: A Web Server to Extract Structural Features of Related But Unaligned RNA Sequences.,"Identifying the common structural elements of functionally related RNA sequences (family) is usually based on an alignment of the sequences, which is often subject to human bias and may not be accurate. The resulting covariance model (CM) provides probabilities for each base to covary with another, which allows to support evolutionarily the formation of double helical regions and possibly pseudoknots. The coexistence of alternative folds in RNA, resulting from its dynamic nature, may lead to the potential omission of motifs by CM. To overcome this limitation, we present D-ORB, a system of algorithms that identifies overrepresented motifs in the secondary conformational landscapes of a family when compared to those of unrelated sequences. The algorithms are bundled into an easy-to-use website allowing users to submit a family, and optionally provide unrelated sequences. D-ORB produces a non-pseudoknotted secondary structure based on the overrepresented motifs, a deep neural network classifier and two decision trees. When used to model an Rfam family, D-ORB fits overrepresented motifs in the corresponding Rfam structure; more than a hundred Rfam families have been modeled. The statistical approach behind D-ORB derives the structural composition of an RNA family, making it a valuable tool for analyzing and modeling it. Its easy-to-use interface and advanced algorithms make it an essential resource for researchers studying RNA structure.

36747479,SalivaDB-a comprehensive database for salivary biomarkers in humans.,"Saliva as a non-invasive diagnostic fluid has immense potential as a tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of patients. The information about salivary biomarkers is broadly scattered across various resources and research papers. It is important to bring together all the information on salivary biomarkers to a single platform. This will accelerate research and development in non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of complex diseases. We collected widespread information on five types of salivary biomarkers-proteins, metabolites, microbes, micro-ribonucleic acid (miRNA) and genes found in humans. This information was collected from different resources that include PubMed, the Human Metabolome Database and SalivaTecDB. Our database SalivaDB contains a total of 15 821 entries for 201 different diseases and 48 disease categories. These entries can be classified into five categories based on the type of biomolecules; 6067, 3987, 2909, 2272 and 586 entries belong to proteins, metabolites, microbes, miRNAs and genes, respectively. The information maintained in this database includes analysis methods, associated diseases, biomarker type, regulation status, exosomal origin, fold change and sequence. The entries are linked to relevant biological databases to provide users with comprehensive information. We developed a web-based interface that provides a wide range of options like browse, keyword search and advanced search. In addition, a similarity search module has been integrated which allows users to perform a similarity search using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and Smith-Waterman algorithm against biomarker sequences in SalivaDB.

Prominently, CBP60g and SARD1 are paralogous CBP60 transcription factors that regulate numerous components of the immune system, such as cell surface and intracellular immune receptors, MAP kinases, WRKY transcription factors, and biosynthetic enzymes for immunity-activating metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and <i>N</i>-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). However, their function, regulation, and diversification in most species remain unclear. Here, we have created CBP60-DB (https://cbp60db.wlu.ca/), a structural and bioinformatic database that comprehensively characterized 1052 <i>CBP60</i> gene homologs (encoding 2376 unique transcripts and 1996 unique proteins) across 62 phylogenetically diverse genomes in the plant kingdom. We have employed deep learning-predicted structural analyses using AlphaFold2 and then generated dedicated web pages for all plant CBP60 proteins. Importantly, we have generated a novel clustering visualization algorithm to interrogate kingdom-wide structural similarities for more efficient inference of conserved functions across various plant taxa. Because well-characterized CBP60 proteins in Arabidopsis are known to be transcription factors with putative calmodulin-binding domains, we have integrated external bioinformatic resources to analyze protein domains and motifs.

39205165,VOGDB-Database of Virus Orthologous Groups.,"Computational models of homologous protein groups are essential in sequence bioinformatics. Due to the diversity and rapid evolution of viruses, the grouping of protein sequences from virus genomes is particularly challenging. The low sequence similarities of homologous genes in viruses require specific approaches for sequence- and structure-based clustering. Furthermore, the annotation of virus genomes in public databases is not as consistent and up to date as for many cellular genomes. To tackle these problems, we have developed VOGDB, which is a database of virus orthologous groups. VOGDB is a multi-layer database that progressively groups viral genes into groups connected by increasingly remote similarity. The first layer is based on pair-wise sequence similarities, the second layer is based on the sequence profile alignments, and the third layer uses predicted protein structures to find the most remote similarity. VOGDB groups allow for more sensitive homology searches of novel genes and increase the chance of predicting annotations or inferring phylogeny. VOGD B uses all virus genomes from RefSeq and partially reannotates them. VOGDB is updated with every RefSeq release. The unique feature of VOGDB is the inclusion of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses in the same clustering process, which makes it possible to explore old evolutionary relationships of the two groups.

35567946,PmiRtarbase: A positive miRNA-target regulations database.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nt small non-coding RNA segments that are widely involved in the regulation of gene expression. Accumulating evidences show that miRNAs not only inhibit the expression of some targeted genes but also promote that of some targeted genes in specific conditions. Over the past decades, many miRNA-target databases have been developed from computational prediction and/or experimental validation perspectives. However, there is no database available to systematically collect positive miRNA-target associations that are essential in deciphering the miRNA regulation mechanism. To promote the miRNA study, we developed a new database: PmiRtarbase that acquires validated positive miRNA-target interactions by mining published literature.

Until now, nine different polyQ diseases have been described: Huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and six types of spinocerebellar ataxias-1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17. The pathogenic expansion translates into an aberrant tract of glutamines in the encoded proteins, compromising several cellular functions and biological processes. There is currently no cure available for the progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by the ensuing cytotoxic alterations. Although each disease is considered rare, polyQ diseases constitute the largest group of monogenic neurodegenerative disorders. Information about these disorders is scattered among several books, articles and general databases, hindering exploration by students and researchers, but also by patients and their families. Therefore, we aimed to develop a free online database to fill this gap, by centralizing relevant available information. The PolyQ Database is a platform that focuses on all nine polyQ diseases and offers information about topics that are pertinent for scientists, clinicians and the general public, including epidemiology, the characteristics of the causative genes and the codified proteins, the pathophysiology of the diseases and the main clinical manifestations.

A thorough understanding of hematopoiesis in vivo and facilitation of generating functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro necessitate a comprehensive hematopoietic cross-stage developmental landscape across species. To address this need, we developed HemAtlas, a platform designed for the systematic mapping of hematopoiesis both in vivo and in vitro. HemAtlas features detailed analyses of multi-omics datasets from humans, mice, zebrafish, and HSPC in vitro culture systems. Utilizing literature curation and data normalization, HemAtlas integrates various functional modules, allowing interactive exploration and visualization of any collected omics data based on user-specific interests. Moreover, by applying a systematic and uniform integration method, we constructed organ-wide hematopoietic references for each species with manually curated cell annotations, enabling a comprehensive decoding of cross-stage developmental hematopoiesis at the organ level. Of particular significance are three distinctive functions - single-cell cross-stage, cross-species, and cross-model analyses - that HemAtlas employs to elucidate the hematopoietic development in zebrafish, mice, and humans, and to offer guidance on the generation of HSPCs in vitro. Simultaneously, HemAtlas incorporates a comprehensive map of HSPC cross-stage development to reveal HSPC stage-specific properties.

Therefore, we meticulously identified true germline alleles enriched with complete TR allele sequences and their frequencies across 26 different human populations, profiled by ""1000 Genomes data"". We identified 205 TRAV, 249 TRBV, 16 TRGV and 5 TRDV germline alleles supported by at least four haplotypes. The diversity of germline allelic variants in the TR loci is the highest in Africans, while the majority of the Non-African alleles are specific to the Asian populations, suggesting a diverse profile of TR germline alleles in different human populations. Interestingly, the alleles in the IMGT database are frequent and common across all five super-populations.

38713861,DIRMC: a database of immunotherapy-related molecular characteristics.,"Cancer immunotherapy has brought about a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of cancer treatment. Immunotherapy has changed the treatment landscape for a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. To assist researchers in efficiently uncovering valuable information related to cancer immunotherapy, we have presented a manually curated comprehensive database called DIRMC, which focuses on molecular features involved in cancer immunotherapy. All the content was collected manually from published literature, authoritative clinical trial data submitted by clinicians, some databases for drug target prediction such as DrugBank, and some experimentally confirmed high-throughput data sets for the characterization of immune-related molecular interactions in cancer, such as a curated database of T-cell receptor sequences with known antigen specificity (VDJdb), a pathology-associated TCR database (McPAS-TCR) et al. By constructing a fully connected functional network, ranging from cancer-related gene mutations to target genes to translated target proteins to protein regions or sites that may specifically affect protein function, we aim to comprehensively characterize molecular features related to cancer immunotherapy. We have developed the scoring criteria to assess the reliability of each MHC-peptide-T-cell receptor (TCR) interaction item to provide a reference for users. The database provides a user-friendly interface to browse and retrieve data by genes, target proteins, diseases and more. DIRMC also provides a download and submission page for researchers to access data of interest for further investigation or submit new interactions related to cancer immunotherapy targets. Furthermore, DIRMC provides a graphical interface to help users predict the binding affinity between their own peptide of interest and MHC or TCR. This database will provide researchers with a one-stop resource to understand cancer immunotherapy-related targets as well as data on MHC-peptide-TCR interactions.

Our recent study has identified 3'UTR alternative polyadenylation (APA) quantitative trait loci (3'aQTLs) and connects APA events with QTLs as a major driver of human traits and diseases. Besides 3'UTR, APA events can also occur in intron regions, and increasing evidence has connected intronic polyadenylation with disease risk. However, systematic investigation of the roles of intronic polyadenylation in human diseases remained challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive database across a variety of human tissues. Here, we developed ipaQTL-atlas (http://bioinfo.szbl.ac.cn/ipaQTL) as the first comprehensive portal for intronic polyadenylation.

Proteins are phosphorylated by kinases, which have been studied as drug targets for the treatment of various diseases, particularly cancer. Because kinases have multiple roles in interconnected molecular pathways, their specific regulation is required to enhance beneficial and reduce adversarial effects of drugs. Using our previously developed platform, we measured phosphorylation profiles of MCF7 and K562 cells treated with 94 clinical drugs. These phosphorylation profiles can provide insights into pathway activities and biological functions. Here, we introduce Phosprof, a novel database of drug response based on phosphorylation activity. Phosprof is able to present up- or downregulated phosphorylated signature proteins on pathway maps, significant pathways on the hierarchal tree in signal transduction and commonly perturbed pathways affected by the selected drugs. It also serves as a useful web interface for new or known drug profile search based on their molecular similarity with the 94 drugs.

37223317,TRIPBASE: a database for identifying the human genomic DNA and lncRNA triplexes.,"Long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA sequences which are >200 nt with no coding capacity. These lncRNAs participate in various biological mechanisms, and are widely abundant in a diversity of species. There is well-documented evidence that lncRNAs can interact with genomic DNAs by forming triple helices (triplexes). Previously, several computational methods have been designed based on the Hoogsteen base-pair rule to find theoretical RNA-DNA:DNA triplexes. While powerful, these methods suffer from a high false-positive rate between the predicted triplexes and the biological experiments. To address this issue, we first collected the experimental data of genomic RNA-DNA triplexes from antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated capture assays and used Triplexator, the most widely used tool for lncRNA-DNA interaction, to reveal the intrinsic information on true triplex binding potential. Based on the analysis, we proposed six computational attributes as filters to improve the <i>in-silico</i> triplex prediction by removing most false positives. Further, we have built a new database, TRIPBASE, as the first comprehensive collection of genome-wide triplex predictions of human lncRNAs. In TRIPBASE, the user interface allows scientists to apply customized filtering criteria to access the potential triplexes of human lncRNAs in the <i>cis</i>-regulatory regions of the human genome.

In spite of the great interest in uncovering the processing of observed bodily movements and actions in neuroscience and cognitive science, at present, no standardized set of video stimuli for action observation research in neuroimaging settings exists. To facilitate future action observation research, we developed an open-access database of 135 high-definition videos of a male actor performing object-oriented actions. Actions from 3 categories: kinematically natural and goal-intact (<i>Normal</i>), kinematically unnatural and goal-intact (<i>How</i>), or kinematically natural and goal-violating (<i>What</i>), directed toward 15 different objects were filmed from 3 angles. Psychometric evaluation of the database revealed high video recognition accuracy (<i>Mean</i> accuracy = 88.61 %) and substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' <i>Kappa</i> = 0.702), establishing excellent validity and reliability. Videos' exact timing of motion onset was identified using a custom motion detection frame-differencing procedure. Based on its outcome, the videos were edited to assure that motion begins at the second frame of each video. The videos' timing of category recognition was also identified using a novel behavioral up-down staircase procedure. The identified timings can be incorporated in future experimental designs to counteract jittered stimulus onsets, thus vastly improving the sensitivity of neuroimaging experiments.

However, effectively integrating or sharing these datasets among the research community is challenging, especially for laboratory scientists. In this study, we manually curated up-to-date datasets generated in animal scRNA-seq studies, analyzed them using a unified processing pipeline, and comprehensively annotated 107 viral receptors in 142 viruses and obtained accurate expression signatures in 2 100 962 cells from 47 animal species. Thus, the VThunter database provides a user-friendly interface for the research community to explore the expression signatures of viral receptors. VThunter offers an informative and convenient resource for scientists to better understand the interactions between viral receptors and animal viruses and to assess viral pathogenesis and transmission in species.

34634815,SomaMutDB: a database of somatic mutations in normal human tissues.,"De novo mutations, a consequence of errors in DNA repair or replication, have been reported to accumulate with age in normal tissues of humans and model organisms. This accumulation during development and aging has been implicated as a causal factor in aging and age-related pathology, including but not limited to cancer. Due to their generally very low abundance mutations have been difficult to detect in normal tissues. Only with recent advances in DNA sequencing of single-cells, clonal lineages or ultra-high-depth sequencing of small tissue biopsies, somatic mutation frequencies and spectra have been unveiled in several tissue types. The rapid accumulation of such data prompted us to develop a platform called SomaMutDB (https://vijglab.einsteinmed.org/SomaMutDB) to catalog the 2.42 million single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 0.12 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs) thus far identified using these advanced methods in nineteen human tissues or cell types as a function of age or environmental stress conditions. SomaMutDB employs a user-friendly interface to display and query somatic mutations with their functional annotations. Moreover, the database provides six powerful tools for analyzing mutational signatures associated with the data. We believe such an integrated resource will prove valuable for understanding somatic mutations and their possible role in human aging and age-related diseases.",True,False,4.5,,somamutdb,,16.0,ok,,a database of somatic mutations in normal human tissues,,spacy,0.0,SomaMutDB,True,6.0,True,True,https://vijglab.einsteinmed.org/SomaMutDB,https://vijglab.einsteinmed.org/SomaMutDB,True,...ompted us to develop a platform called SomaMutDB (https://vijglab.einsteinmed.org/SomaMutDB) to catalog the 2.42 million single nucleotide va...,1

COVID-19, an epidemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been found to be accompanied with multiple-organ failure since its first report in Dec 2019. To reveal tissue-specific molecular characteristics, researches regarding to COVID-19 have been carried out widely, especially at single-cell resolution. However, these researches are still relatively independent and scattered, limiting the comprehensive understanding of the impact of virus on diverse tissues. To this end, we developed a single-cell atlas of COVID-19. Firstly we collected 21 single-cell datasets of COVID-19 across 10 human tissues paired with control datasets. Then we constructed a pipeline for the analysis of these datasets to reveal molecular characteristics of COVID-19 based on manually annotated cell types. The current version of SCovid documents 1 042 227 single cells of 21 single-cell datasets across 10 human tissues, 11 713 stably expressed genes and 3778 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

37010519,PurificationDB: database of purification conditions for proteins.,"The isolation of proteins of interest from cell lysates is an integral step to study protein structure and function. Liquid chromatography is a technique commonly used for protein purification, where the separation is performed by exploiting the differences in physical and chemical characteristics of proteins. The complex nature of proteins requires researchers to carefully choose buffers that maintain stability and activity of the protein while also allowing for appropriate interaction with chromatography columns. To choose the proper buffer, biochemists often search for reports of successful purification in the literature; however, they often encounter roadblocks such as lack of accessibility to journals, non-exhaustive specification of components and unfamiliar naming conventions. To overcome such issues, we present PurificationDB (https://purificationdatabase.herokuapp.com/), an open-access and user-friendly knowledge base that contains 4732 curated and standardized entries of protein purification conditions. Buffer specifications were derived from the literature using named-entity recognition techniques developed using common nomenclature provided by protein biochemists. PurificationDB also incorporates information associated with well-known protein databases: Protein Data Bank and UniProt. PurificationDB facilitates easy access to data on protein purification techniques and contributes to the growing effort of creating open resources that organize experimental conditions and data for improved access and analysis.

Although database resources for ecDNA are now available, a sophisticated web application dedicated to ecDNA gene analysis remains absent. Therefore, we developed ecDNA gene analyzer (ECGA). ECGA catalogues 23,274 unique ecDNA genes of 27 cancers across 27 tissues. ECGA also offers five specialized analysis tools: (1) 'Venn analysis' looks for overlaps between a given gene list and ecDNA genes; (2) 'Enrichment analysis' performs over-representation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis of input gene list within predefined ecDNA gene sets; (3) 'Target discovery' identifies upregulated ecDNA genes as targets by comparing with reference expression in normal samples; (4) 'DE analysis' finds differentially expressed ecDNA genes; (5) 'Signature discovery' discerns ecDNA gene signatures capable of classifying samples into phenotypic groups, and it is accompanied by 'Signature validation' for model test on unseen data. In summary, ECGA emerges as an indispensable platform in cancer genetics, bridging gaps in basic research, medical reporting, and pharmaceutical development, and propelling ecDNA research forward.

37387524,PETCH-DB: a Portal for Exploring Tissue-specific and Complex disease-associated 5-Hydroxymethylcytosines.,"Epigenetic modifications play critical roles in gene regulation and disease pathobiology. Highly sensitive enabling technologies, including microarray- and sequencing-based approaches have allowed genome-wide profiling of cytosine modifications in DNAs in clinical samples to facilitate discovery of epigenetic biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Historically, many previous studies, however, did not distinguish the most investigated 5-methylcytosines (5mC) from other modified cytosines, especially the biochemically stable 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), which have been shown to have a distinct genomic distribution and regulatory role from 5mC. Notably, during the past several years, the 5hmC-Seal, a highly sensitive chemical labeling technique, has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in clinically feasible biospecimens (e.g. a few milliliter of plasma or serum). The 5hmC-Seal technique has been utilized by our team in biomarker discovery for human cancers and other complex diseases using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), as well as the characterization of the first 5hmC Human Tissue Map. Convenient access to the accumulating 5hmC-Seal data will allow the research community to validate and re-use these results, potentially providing novel insights into epigenetic contribution to a range of human diseases. Here we introduce the PETCH-DB, an integrated database that was implemented to provide 5hmC-related results generated using the 5hmC-Seal technique. We aim the PETCH-DB to be a central portal, which will be available to the scientific community with regularly updated 5hmC data in clinical samples to reflect current advances in this field.

37207327,ResFinderFG v2.0: a database of antibiotic resistance genes obtained by functional metagenomics.,"Metagenomics can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). ARGs found in databases such as ResFinder and CARD primarily originate from culturable and pathogenic bacteria, while ARGs from non-culturable and non-pathogenic bacteria remain understudied. Functional metagenomics is based on phenotypic gene selection and can identify ARGs from non-culturable bacteria with a potentially low identity shared with known ARGs. In 2016, the ResFinderFG v1.0 database was created to collect ARGs from functional metagenomics studies. Here, we present the second version of the database, ResFinderFG v2.0, which is available on the Center of Genomic Epidemiology web server (https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/ResFinderFG/). It comprises 3913 ARGs identified by functional metagenomics from 50 carefully curated datasets. We assessed its potential to detect ARGs in comparison to other popular databases in gut, soil and water (marine + freshwater) Global Microbial Gene Catalogues (https://gmgc.embl.de). ResFinderFG v2.0 allowed for the detection of ARGs that were not detected using other databases. These included ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactams, cycline, phenicol, glycopeptide/cycloserine and trimethoprim/sulfonamide.

However, systematic analysis of cancer enhancers poses a challenge due to the lack of integrative data resources, especially those from tumor primary tissues. To provide a comprehensive enhancer profile across cancer types, we developed a cancer enhancer database CenhANCER by curating public resources including all the public H3K27ac ChIP-Seq data from 805 primary tissue samples and 671 cell line samples across 41 cancer types. In total, 57 029 408 typical enhancers, 978 411 super-enhancers and 226 726 enriched transcription factors were identified. We annotated the super-enhancers with chromatin accessibility regions, cancer expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), genotype-tissue expression eQTLs and genome-wide association study risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for further functional analysis. The identified enhancers were highly consistent with accessible chromatin regions in the corresponding cancer types, and all the 10 super-enhancer regions identified from one colorectal cancer study were recapitulated in our CenhANCER, both of which testified the high quality of our data. CenhANCER with high-quality cancer enhancer candidates and transcription factors that are potential therapeutic targets across multiple cancer types provides a credible resource for single cancer analysis and for comparative studies of various cancer types.

37207351,Developing TeroENZ and TeroMAP modules for the terpenome research platform TeroKit.,"Terpenoids and their derivatives are collectively known as the terpenome and are the largest class of natural products, whose biosynthesis refers to various kinds of enzymes. To date, there is no terpenome-related enzyme database, which is a desire for enzyme mining, metabolic engineering and discovery of new natural products related to terpenoids. In this work, we have constructed a comprehensive database called TeroENZ (http://terokit.qmclab.com/browse_enz.html) containing 13 462 enzymes involved in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, covering 2541 species and 4293 reactions reported in the literature and public databases. At the same time, we classify enzymes according to their catalytic reactions into cyclase, oxidoreductase, transferase, and so on, and also make a classification according to species. This meticulous classification is beneficial for users as it can be retrieved and downloaded conveniently. We also provide a computational module for isozyme prediction. Moreover, a module named TeroMAP (http://terokit.qmclab.com/browse_rxn.html) is also constructed to organize all available terpenoid enzymatic reactions into an interactive network by interfacing with the previously established database of terpenoid compounds, TeroMOL.

35061087,NucPosDB: a database of nucleosome positioning in vivo and nucleosomics of cell-free DNA.,"Nucleosome positioning is involved in many gene regulatory processes happening in the cell, and it may change as cells differentiate or respond to the changing microenvironment in a healthy or diseased organism. One important implication of nucleosome positioning in clinical epigenetics is its use in the ""nucleosomics"" analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for the purpose of patient diagnostics in liquid biopsies. The rationale for this is that the apoptotic nucleases that digest chromatin of the dying cells mostly cut DNA between nucleosomes. Thus, the short pieces of DNA in body fluids reflect the positions of nucleosomes in the cells of origin. Here, we report a systematic nucleosomics database - NucPosDB - curating published nucleosome positioning datasets in vivo as well as datasets of sequenced cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that reflect nucleosome positioning in situ in the cells of origin. Users can select subsets of the database by a number of criteria and then obtain raw or processed data. NucPosDB also reports the originally determined regions with stable nucleosome occupancy across several individuals with a given condition. An additional section provides a catalogue of computational tools for the analysis of nucleosome positioning or cfDNA experiments and theoretical algorithms for the prediction of nucleosome positioning preferences from DNA sequence. We provide an overview of the field, describe the structure of the database in this context, and demonstrate data variability using examples of different medical conditions. NucPosDB is useful both for the analysis of fundamental gene regulation processes and the training of computational models for patient diagnostics based on cfDNA. The database currently curates ~ 400 publications on nucleosome positioning in cell lines and in situ as well as cfDNA from > 10,000 patients and healthy volunteers.

In this study, we constructed a new platform (iORbase, https://www.iorbase.com) for the structural and functional analysis of iORs based on a combined algorithm for gene annotation and protein structure prediction. Moreover, it provides the option to calculate the binding affinities and binding residues between iORs and pheromone molecules by virtual screening of docking. Furthermore, iORbase supports the automatic structural and functional prediction of user-submitted iORs or pheromones. iORbase contains the well-analyzed results of approximately 6 000 iORs and their 3D protein structures identified from 59 insect species and 2 077 insect pheromones from the literature, as well as approximately 12 million pairs of simulated interactions between functional iORs and pheromones. We also built 4 online modules, iORPDB, iInteraction, iModelTM, and iOdorTool to easily retrieve and visualize the 3D structures and interactions. iORbase can help greatly improve the experimental efficiency and success rate, identify new insecticide targets, or develop electronic nose technology.

It combines machine learning approaches with a rule-based system to predict small-molecule metabolism in human tissues, the human gut as well as the external environment (soil and water microbiota). Simply stated, BioTransformer takes a molecular structure as input (SMILES or SDF) and outputs an interactively sortable table of the predicted metabolites or transformation products (SMILES, PNG images) along with the enzymes that are predicted to be responsible for those reactions and richly annotated downloadable files (CSV and JSON). The entire process typically takes less than a minute. Previous versions of BioTransformer focused exclusively on predicting the metabolism of xenobiotics (such as plant natural products, drugs, cosmetics and other synthetic compounds) using a limited number of pre-defined steps and somewhat limited rule-based methods. BioTransformer 3.0 uses much more sophisticated methods and incorporates new databases, new constraints and new prediction modules to not only more accurately predict the metabolic transformation products of exogenous xenobiotics but also the transformation products of endogenous metabolites, such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, organic acids, and lipids. BioTransformer 3.0 can also support customized sequential combinations of these transformations along with multiple iterations to simulate multi-step human biotransformation events.

Here, we report an updated server, Group-based Prediction System (GPS) 6.0, for prediction of PK-specific phosphorylation sites (p-sites) in eukaryotes. First, we pre-trained a general model using penalized logistic regression (PLR), deep neural network (DNN), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGMB) on 490 762 non-redundant p-sites in 71 407 proteins. Then, transfer learning was conducted to obtain 577 PK-specific predictors at the group, family and single PK levels, using a well-curated data set of 30 043 known site-specific kinase-substrate relations in 7041 proteins. Together with the evolutionary information, GPS 6.0 could hierarchically predict PK-specific p-sites for 44046 PKs in 185 species. Besides the basic statistics, we also offered the knowledge from 22 public resources to annotate the prediction results, including the experimental evidence, physical interactions, sequence logos, and p-sites in sequences and 3D structures.

39484850,CASRdb: A Publicly Accessible Comprehensive Database for Disease-Associated Calcium-Sensing Receptor Variants.,"<h4>Context</h4>Genetic testing of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene is crucial for confirming diagnoses of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type I (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type I (ADH1). Therefore, we created a publicly accessible comprehensive database of the disease-causing variants of the CASR gene.<h4>Evidence acquisition</h4>We used 2 sources for variant reports: (1) we conducted a systematic review in the Embase and PubMed databases from inception to March 2023, using search strategies associated with CASR. We identified all articles reporting CASR variants associated with disorders of calcium metabolism. (2) Additionally, data associated with pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in the ClinVar and LOVD databases were retrieved. Benign or likely benign variants were excluded. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were included only if they were reported in the literature. We generated a library of CASR variants associated with phenotypes, which has been made available on a website.<h4>Evidence synthesis</h4>We identified a total of 498 variants, of which 121 (24.3%) were associated with ADH1 and 377 (75.7%) with FHH1. Most included variants were identified from the literature (117 activating and 352 inactivating variants), and the majority of these were not documented in ClinVar/LOVD (73/117, 62.4% activating variants; 207/352, 58.8% inactivating variants).<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed CASRdb, a database that compiles information on all CASR variants associated with disorders of calcium metabolism from existing literature and genomic databases.

36453831,CovBinderInPDB: A Structure-Based Covalent Binder Database.,"Covalent inhibition has emerged as a promising orthogonal approach for drug discovery, despite the significant challenge in achieving target specificity. To facilitate the structure-based rational design of target-specific covalent modulators, we developed an integrated computational protocol to curate covalent binders from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). Starting from the macromolecular crystallographic information files (mmCIF) in the PDB archive, covalent bond records, which indicate the side chain modification of amino acid residue by a covalent binder, were collected and cleaned. Then, residue-binder adducts, which are products of chemical reactions between targeted residues and covalent binders, were recovered with the help of the Chemical Component Dictionary in PDB. Finally, several strategies were employed to curate the pre-reaction forms of covalent binders from the adducts. Our curated CovBinderInPDB database contains 7375 covalent modifications in which 2189 unique covalent binders target nine types of amino acid residues (Cys, Lys, Ser, Asp, Glu, His, Met, Thr, and Tyr) from 3555 complex structures of 1170 unique protein chains.

39697868,KTED: a comprehensive web-based database for transposable elements in the Korean genome.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Transposable elements (TEs), commonly referred to as ""mobile elements,"" constitute DNA segments capable of relocating within a genome. Initially disregarded as ""junk DNA"" devoid of specific functionality, it has become evident that TEs have diverse influences on an organism's biology and health. The impact of these elements varies according to their location, classification, and their effects on specific genes or regulatory components. Despite their significant roles, a paucity of resources concerning TEs in population-scale genome sequencing remains.

They cause various human diseases and pose serious threats to human health. Mutations can increase the transmissibility and virulence of the strains, reducing the protection provided by vaccines and weakening the efficacy of antiviral drugs. In this study, we established a manually curated database (termed AVM) to store information on aerosol-transmitted viral mutations (VMs). The current version of the AVM contains 42,041 VMs (including 2613 immune escape mutations), 45 clinical information datasets, and 407 drugs/antibodies/vaccines. Additionally, we recorded 88 human diseases associated with viruses and found that the same virus can target multiple organs in the body, leading to diverse diseases. Furthermore, the AVM database offers a straightforward user interface for browsing, retrieving, and downloading information.

Bias in amino acid composition of these proteins determines their unique biophysical and functional features. Distinct intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with compositional bias play different important roles in various biological processes. IDRs enriched in particular amino acids in human proteome have not been described consistently.<h4>Results</h4>We developed DisEnrich-the database of human proteome IDRs that are significantly enriched in particular amino acids. Each human protein is described using Gene Ontology (GO) function terms, disorder prediction for the full-length sequence using three methods, enriched IDR composition and ranks of human proteins with similar enriched IDRs. Distribution analysis of enriched IDRs among broad functional categories revealed significant overrepresentation of R- and Y-enriched IDRs in metabolic and enzymatic activities and F-enriched IDRs in transport.

38043216,ListiWiki: A database for the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.,"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram positive foodborne pathogen that regularly causes outbreaks of systemic infectious diseases. The bacterium maintains a facultative intracellular lifestyle; it thrives under a variety of environmental conditions and is able to infect human host cells. L. monocytogenes is genetically tractable and therefore has become an attractive model system to study the mechanisms employed by facultative intracellular bacteria to invade eukaryotic cells and to replicate in their cytoplasm. Besides its importance for basic research, L. monocytogenes also serves as a paradigmatic pathogen in genomic epidemiology, where the relative stability of its genome facilitates successful outbreak detection and elucidation of transmission chains in genomic pathogen surveillance systems. In both terms, it is necessary to keep the annotation of the L. monocytogenes genome up to date. Therefore, we have created the database ListiWiki (http://listiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/) which stores comprehensive information on the widely used L. monocytogenes reference strain EDG-e. ListiWiki is designed to collect information on genes, proteins and RNAs and their relevant functional characteristics, but also further information such as mutant phenotypes, available biological material, and publications. In its present form, ListiWiki combines the most recent annotation of the EDG-e genome with published data on gene essentiality, gene expression and subcellular protein localization. ListiWiki also predicts protein-protein interactions networks based on protein homology to Bacillus subtilis proteins, for which detailed interaction maps have been compiled in the sibling database SubtiWiki. Furthermore, crystallographic information of proteins is made accessible through integration of Protein Structure Database codes and AlphaFold structure predictions. ListiWiki is an easy-to-use web interface that has been developed with a focus on an intuitive access to all information. Use of ListiWiki is free of charge and its content can be edited by all members of the scientific community after registration.

To promote data-driven biological research, the Korean government announced that all biological data generated from government-funded research projects should be deposited at the Korea BioData Station (K-BDS), which consists of multiple databases for individual data types. Here, we introduce the Korean Nucleotide Archive (KoNA), a repository of nucleotide sequence data. As of July 2022, the Korean Read Archive in KoNA has collected over 477 TB of raw next-generation sequencing data from national genome projects. To ensure data quality and prepare for international alignment, a standard operating procedure was adopted, which is similar to that of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. The standard operating procedure includes quality control processes for submitted data and metadata using an automated pipeline, followed by manual examination. To ensure fast and stable data transfer, a high-speed transmission system called GBox is used in KoNA. Furthermore, the data uploaded to or downloaded from KoNA through GBox can be readily processed using a cloud computing service called Bio-Express. This seamless coupling of KoNA, GBox, and Bio-Express enhances the data experience, including submission, access, and analysis of raw nucleotide sequences.

Online teaching was preferred by many medical schools. However due to the complexity of intracranial anatomy, it was challenging for the students to study this part online, and the students were likely to be tired of neurosurgery, which is disadvantageous to the development of neurosurgery. Therefore, we developed this database to help students learn better neuroanatomy.<h4>Main body</h4>The data were sourced from Rhoton's Cranial Anatomy and Surgical Approaches and Neurosurgery Tricks of the Trade in this database. Then we designed many hand gesture figures connected with the atlas of anatomy. Our database was divided into three parts: intracranial arteries, intracranial veins, and neurosurgery approaches. Each section below contains an atlas of anatomy, and gestures represent vessels and nerves. Pictures of hand gestures and atlas of anatomy are available to view on GRAVEN ( www.graven.cn ) without restrictions for all teachers and students. We recruited 50 undergraduate students and randomly divided them into two groups: using traditional teaching methods or GRAVEN database combined with above traditional teaching methods. Results revealed a significant improvement in academic performance in using GRAVEN database combined with traditional teaching methods compared to the traditional teaching methods.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This database was vital to help students learn about intracranial anatomy and neurosurgical approaches.

38272936,AVDOS-VR: Affective Video Database with Physiological Signals and Continuous Ratings Collected Remotely in VR.,"Investigating emotions relies on pre-validated stimuli to evaluate induced responses through subjective self-ratings and physiological changes. The creation of precise affect models necessitates extensive datasets. While datasets related to pictures, words, and sounds are abundant, those associated with videos are comparatively scarce. To overcome this challenge, we present the first virtual reality (VR) database with continuous self-ratings and physiological measures, including facial EMG. Videos were rated online using a head-mounted VR device (HMD) with attached emteqPRO mask and a cinema VR environment in remote home and laboratory settings with minimal setup requirements. This led to an affective video database with continuous valence and arousal self-rating measures and physiological responses (PPG, facial-EMG (7x), IMU). The AVDOS-VR database includes data from 37 participants who watched 30 randomly ordered videos (10 positive, neutral, and negative). Each 30-second video was assessed with two-minute relaxation between categories. Validation results suggest that remote data collection is ecologically valid, providing an effective strategy for future affective study designs.

35536846,ThermoBase: A database of the phylogeny and physiology of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms.,"Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles are those organisms which grow at high temperature (> 40°C). The unusual properties of these organisms have received interest in multiple fields of biological research, and have found applications in biotechnology, especially in industrial processes. However, there are few listings of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms and their relevant environmental and physiological data. Such repositories can be used to standardize definitions of thermophile and hyperthermophile limits and tolerances and would mitigate the need for extracting organism data from diverse literature sources across multiple, sometimes loosely related, research fields. Therefore, we have developed ThermoBase, a web-based and freely available database which currently houses comprehensive descriptions for 1238 thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms. ThermoBase reports taxonomic, metabolic, environmental, experimental, and physiological information in addition to literature resources. This includes parameters such as coupling ions for chemiosmosis, optimal pH and range, optimal temperature and range, optimal pressure, and optimal salinity. The database interface allows for search features and sorting of parameters. As such, it is the goal of ThermoBase to facilitate and expedite hypothesis generation, literature research, and understanding relating to thermophiles and hyperthermophiles within the scientific community in an accessible and centralized repository.

Investigations into its molecular mechanisms have generated a wealth of expression data, including bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. A comprehensively integrated and well-curated erythropoiesis-specific database will greatly facilitate the mining of gene expression data and enable large-scale research of erythropoiesis and erythroid-related diseases. Here, we present EryDB, an open-access and comprehensive database dedicated to the collection, integration, analysis, and visualization of transcriptomic data for erythropoiesis and erythroid-related diseases.

39436255,NeoTCR: An Immunoinformatic Database of Experimentally-supported Functional Neoantigen-specific TCR Sequences.,"Neoantigen-based immunotherapy has demonstrated long-lasting antitumor activity. The recognition of neoantigens by T cell receptors (TCRs) is considered a trigger for antitumor responses. Due to the overwhelming number of TCR repertoires in the human genome, pinpointing neoantigen-specific TCRs is a formidable challenge. Recent studies have identified a number of functional neoantigen-specific TCRs, but the corresponding information is scattered across published literature and is difficult to retrieve. To improve access to these data, we developed an immunoinformatic database (NeoTCR) containing a unified description of publicly available neoantigen-specific TCR sequences, as well as relevant information on targeted neoantigens, from experimentally-supported studies across 17 cancer subtypes. A user-friendly web interface allows interactive browsing and running of complex database queries. To facilitate rapid identification of neoantigen-specific TCRs from raw sequencing data, NeoTCR offers a one-stop analysis for annotation and visualization of TCR clonotypes, discovery of existing neoantigen-specific TCRs, and exclusion of bystander virus-associated TCRs. NeoTCR represents a unique tool to expedite future studies of neoantigen-specific TCRs and the development of neoantigen-based immunotherapy.

To assist in studies on the regulatory mechanisms of ncPEPs, we describe here a database called SPENCER (http://spencer.renlab.org). Currently, SPENCER has collected a total of 2806 mass spectrometry (MS) data points from 55 studies, covering 1007 tumor samples and 719 normal samples. Using an MS-based proteomics analysis pipeline, SPENCER identified 29 526 ncPEPs across 15 different cancer types. Specifically, 22 060 of these ncPEPs were experimentally validated in other studies. By comparing tumor and normal samples, the identified ncPEPs were divided into four expression groups: tumor-specific, upregulated in cancer, downregulated in cancer, and others. Additionally, since ncPEPs are potential targets for neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy, SPENCER also predicted the immunogenicity of all the identified ncPEPs by assessing their MHC-I binding affinity, stability, and TCR recognition probability. As a result, 4497 ncPEPs curated in SPENCER were predicted to be immunogenic. Overall, SPENCER will be a useful resource for investigating cancer-associated ncPEPs and may boost further research in cancer.",True,False,4.0,,,spencer,16.0,ok,,bioactive peptides,,spacy,0.0,SPENCER,True,5.0,True,True,http://spencer.renlab.org,http://spencer.renlab.org,True,"...PEPs, we describe here a database called SPENCER (http://spencer.renlab.org).

36817105,Galaxy ASIST: A web-based platform for mapping and assessment of global standards of antimicrobial susceptibility: A case study in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> genomes.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is used to determine the susceptibility of an organism to antibiotics. The determination of susceptibility is based on MIC breakpoints and is provided by EUCAST and CLSI. Likewise, phenotypic classification criteria developed by CDC/ECDC are used for the classification of pathogens into susceptible, multidrug-resistant, extremely drug-resistant, or totally drug-resistant categories. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based diagnosis is now supplementing existing gold-standard microbiology methods for rapid and more precise AST, and therefore, EUCAST recommended quality criteria to assess whole-genome sequence for reporting the same. In this study, these three global standards, MIC breakpoints, phenotypic classification, and genome quality, are applied to the largest publicly available data for Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), the most critical priority pathogen identified by WHO.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The drug sensitivity profile and genomes for isolates of AB were obtained from PATRIC and evaluated with respect to AST standards (CLSI and EUCAST). Whole genome quality assessment and antimicrobial resistance mapping is performed with QUAST and ABRicate, respectively. Four in-house methods are developed for mapping standards and are integrated into a Galaxy workflow based system, Galaxy-ASIST. Analysis of the extent of agreement between CLSI 2022 and EUCAST 2022 for antibiotics was carried out using Cohen's kappa statistics.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>An automated pipeline, Galaxy-ASIST, is designed and developed for the characterization of clinical isolates based on these standards. Evaluation of over 6,500 AB strains using Galaxy-ASIST indicated that only 10% of the publicly available datasets have metadata to implement these standards. Furthermore, given that CLSI and EUCAST have different MIC breakpoints, discrepancies are observed in the classification of resistant and susceptible isolates following these standards. It is, therefore, imperative that platforms are developed that allow the evaluation of ever increasing phenotypic and genome sequence datasets for AST. Galaxy-ASIST offers a centralized repository and a structured metadata architecture to provide a single globally acceptable framework for AST profiling of clinical isolates based on global standards. The platform also offers subsequent fine mapping of antimicrobial-resistant determinants.

These various metabolites are widely used as medicinal precursors and insecticides. Secondary metabolism genes are commonly arranged in clusters along chromosomes, which allow for the coordinate control of complete pathways. In this study, we created the Fungal Gene Cluster Database to store, retrieve, and visualize secondary metabolite gene cluster information across fungal species. The database was created by merging data from RNA sequencing, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, genome browser, enrichment analysis and the R Shiny web framework to visualize and query putative gene clusters. This database facilitated the rapid and thorough examination of significant gene clusters across fungal species by detecting, defining and graphically displaying the architecture, organization and expression patterns of secondary metabolite gene clusters.

Incomplete knowledge of best practices, progression of disease, and its impact could result in fallible care. Data on symptoms and advancement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to critical care admission have not been captured or communicated well between international organizations experiencing the same impact from the virus. This led to the expedited need for establishing international communication and data collection on the critical care patients admitted with COVID-19.<h4>Objective</h4>Developing a global registry to collect patient data in the critical care setting was imperative with the goal of analyzing and ameliorating outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective, observational global registry database was put together to record extensive deidentified clinical information for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>Project management was crucial for prompt implementation of the registry for synchronization, improving efficiency, increasing innovation, and fostering global collaboration for valuable data collection. The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery VIRUS (Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study): COVID-19 Registry would compile data for crucial longitudinal outcomes for disease, treatment, and research. The agile project management approach expedited establishing the registry in 15 days and submission of institutional review board agreement for 250 participating sites. There has been enrollment of sites every month with a total of 306 sites from 28 countries and 64,114 patients enrolled (as of June 7, 2021).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This protocol addresses project management lessons in a time of crises which can be a precept for rapid project management for a large-scale health care data registry. We aim to discuss the approach and methodology for establishing the registry, the challenges faced, and the factors contributing to successful outcomes.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04323787; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04323787.",True,False,3.0,,global covid-19 virus registry database,,11.0,ok,,a large-scale | iral infection and respiratory illness universal study): covid-19 registry,virus (v,spacy,0.0,Lessons From a Rapid Project Management Exercise in the Time of Pandemic,True,8.0,False,False,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04323787,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04323787,True,...registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04323787; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04323787.,1

This constraint often prompts the use of low-frequency or low-prevalence words, introducing the potential influence of prior knowledge or direct translation to familiar words. In response, we developed novel abstract concepts devoid of word referents, providing better control over prior knowledge. These new concepts describe situations encountered in various settings for which there is no existing word in English. The resulting database comprises 42 normed New Abstract Concepts, offering unique materials structured through scenarios, each containing similar and dissimilar exemplars. These materials underwent meticulous norming for relatability and similarity levels across a series of studies. The success of our approach was demonstrated in a word-learning experiment examining the effects of similarity and diversity.

To understand the basis of brain activity and behaviour, there is a need to define the molecular energetic landscape of the brain<sup>5-10</sup>. Here, to bridge the scale gap between cognitive neuroscience and cell biology, we developed a physical voxelization approach to partition a frozen human coronal hemisphere section into 703 voxels comparable to neuroimaging resolution (3 × 3 × 3 mm). In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes, including OXPHOS enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity. We show that the human brain contains diverse mitochondrial phenotypes driven by both topology and cell types. Compared with white matter, grey matter contains >50% more mitochondria. Moreover, the mitochondria in grey matter are biochemically optimized for energy transformation, particularly among recently evolved cortical brain regions. Scaling these data to the whole brain, we created a backwards linear regression model that integrates several neuroimaging modalities<sup>11</sup> to generate a brain-wide map of mitochondrial distribution and specialization. This model predicted mitochondrial characteristics in an independent brain region of the same donor brain. This approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain function.

Protein abundance, turnover, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are key factors that determine tissue-specific proteome properties. However, these properties are challenging to study across tissues and remain poorly understood. Here, we present Turnover-PPT, a comprehensive resource mapping the abundance and lifetime of 11,000 proteins and 40,000 phosphosites in eight mouse tissues and various brain regions using advanced proteomics and stable isotope labeling. We reveal tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, strong correlations between interacting protein lifetimes, and distinct impacts of phosphorylation on protein turnover. Notably, we discover a remarkable pattern of turnover changes for peroxisome proteins in specific tissues and that phosphorylation regulates the stability of neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau and α-synuclein.

The knowledge of the genetic variability, especially at the level of the local population, is a critical factor for distinguishing pathogenic from non-pathogenic variation in the discovery of new disease variants.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the SPAnish Copy Number Alterations Collaborative Server (SPACNACS), which currently contains copy number variation profiles obtained from more than 400 genomes and exomes of unrelated Spanish individuals. By means of a collaborative crowdsourcing effort whole genome and whole exome sequencing data, produced by local genomic projects and for other purposes, is continuously collected. Once checked both, the Spanish ancestry and the lack of kinship with other individuals in the SPACNACS, the CNVs are inferred for these sequences and they are used to populate the database. A web interface allows querying the database with different filters that include ICD10 upper categories.

38367620,Alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait methylation mapping in human cancers provides clues into the molecular mechanisms of APA.,"Genetic variants are involved in the orchestration of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events, while the role of DNA methylation in regulating APA remains unclear. We generated a comprehensive atlas of APA quantitative trait methylation sites (apaQTMs) across 21 different types of cancer (1,612 to 60,219 acting in cis and 4,448 to 142,349 in trans). Potential causal apaQTMs in non-cancer samples were also identified. Mechanistically, we observed a strong enrichment of cis-apaQTMs near polyadenylation sites (PASs) and both cis- and trans-apaQTMs in proximity to transcription factor (TF) binding regions. Through the integration of ChIP-signals and RNA-seq data from cell lines, we have identified several regulators of APA events, acting either directly or indirectly, implicating novel functions of some important genes, such as TCF7L2, which is known for its involvement in type 2 diabetes and cancers. Furthermore, we have identified a vast number of QTMs that share the same putative causal CpG sites with five different cancer types, underscoring the roles of QTMs, including apaQTMs, in the process of tumorigenesis. DNA methylation is extensively involved in the regulation of APA events in human cancers. In an attempt to elucidate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms of APA by DNA methylation, our study paves the way for subsequent experimental validations into the intricate biological functions of DNA methylation in APA regulation and the pathogenesis of human cancers.

40234567,A coregulatory influence map of glioblastoma heterogeneity and plasticity.,"We present GBM-cRegMap, an online resource providing a comprehensive coregulatory influence network perspective on glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity and plasticity. Using representation learning algorithms, we derived two components of this resource: GBM-CoRegNet, a highly specific coregulatory network of tumor cells, and GBM-CoRegMap, a unified network influence map based on 1612 tumors from 16 studies. As a widely applicable closed-loop system connecting cellular models and tumors, GBM-cRegMap will provide the GBM research community with an easy-to-use web tool ( https://gbm.cregmap.com ) that maps any existing or newly generated transcriptomic ""query"" data to a reference coregulatory network and a large-scale manifold of disease heterogeneity. Using GBM-cRegMap, we demonstrated the synergy between the two components by refining the molecular classification of GBM, identifying potential key regulators, and aligning the transcriptional profiles of tumors and in vitro models. Through the amalgamation of a vast dataset, we validated the proneural (PN)-mesenchymal (MES) axis and identified three subclasses of classical (CL) tumors: astrocyte-like (CL-A), epithelial basal-like (CL-B), and cilium-rich (CL-C). We revealed the CL-C subclass, an intermediate state demonstrating the plasticity of GBM cells along the PN-MES axis under chemotherapy. We identified key regulators, such as PAX8, and NKX2.5, potentially involved in temozolomide (TMZ) resistance.

39812795,A new database to guide reference material selection for dietary supplement and nutrition science.,"Rigorous research on the health effects of dietary supplements and related nutritional interventions requires thorough chemical characterization of complex matrices for their composition of macro- and micronutrients, botanical phytochemicals, and potential contaminants. Reference materials (RMs) with metrologically traceable values for these specific properties are ideal analytical tools to ensure requisite chemical measurements are reliable. However, identifying and comparing appropriate RMs for studying dietary ingredients and their metabolites is challenging, creating a barrier to reproducible regulatory testing and research. To address this challenge, the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health coordinated the development of a new publicly available Reference Materials Search Tool ( https://odsrmst.od.nih.gov/ ) database featuring comprehensive data records and search and comparison functionality.

35508965,A database for retrieving information on SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations based on correlation network analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Over a million genomes and mutational analyses of SARS-CoV-2 are available in public databases, which reveal the phylogenetic tree of the virus. Although these data have enabled scientists to closely track the evolution and transmission dynamics of the virus at global and local scales, the Mu variant, recently identified in infections in South America, shows an unusual combination of mutations, and it is difficult to visualize these atypical characteristics in public databases based on a phylogenetic tree.<h4>Results</h4>The Vcorn SARS-CoV-2 database was constructed to provide information on COVID-19 infections and mutations in the S protein of the virus based on correlation network analysis. A correlation network was constructed using the recall index of one mutation to another mutation. The network includes several network modules in which nodes represent mutations and are tightly connected to each other. Individual network modules contain mutations of single variants, such as the alpha and delta variants. In the network constructed to emphasize mutations of the Mu variant using the database, the mutations were found to be located in multiple network modules, indicating that the mutations of the variant may have originated from multiple variants or be located at a basal position with a high frequency of mutation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Vcorn SARS-CoV-2 provides information on COVID-19 and S protein mutations of SARS-CoV-2 via correlation network analysis.

39937662,Building resource-efficient community databases using open-source software.,"The unprecedented volume of big data being routinely generated for nonmodel crop species, coupled with advanced technology enabling the use of big data in breeding, gives further impetus for the need to have access to crop community databases, where all relevant data are curated and integrated. Funding for such databases is, however, insufficient and intermittent, resulting in the data being underutilized. While increased awareness of the importance of funding databases is important, it is practically necessary to find a more efficient way to build a community database. To meet the need for integrated database resources for various crop genomics, genetics, and breeding research communities, we have built five crop databases over the last decade using an open-source database platform and software. We describe the system and methods used for database construction, curation, and analysis protocols, and the data and tools that are available in these five crop databases.

35810958,A web server for identifying circRNA-RBP variable-length binding sites based on stacked generalization ensemble deep learning network.,"Circular RNA (circRNA) can exert biological functions by interacting with RNA-binding protein (RBP), and some deep learning-based methods have been developed to predict RBP binding sites on circRNA. However, most of these methods identify circRNA-RBP binding sites are only based on single data resource and cannot provide exact binding sites, only providing the probability value of a sequence fragment. To solve these problems, we propose a binding sites localization algorithm that fuses binding sites from multiple databases, and further design a stacked generalization ensemble deep learning model named CirRBP to identify RBP binding sites on circRNA. The CirRBP is trained by combining the binding sites from multiple databases and makes predictions by weighted aggregating the predictions of each sub-model. The results show that the CirRBP outperforms any sub-model and existing online prediction model. For better access to our research results, we develop an open-source web application called CRWS (CircRNA-RBP Web Server). Its back-end learning model of the CRWS is a stacked generalization ensemble learning model CirRBP based on different deep learning frameworks. Given a full-length circRNA or fragment sequence and a target RBP, the CRWS can analyze and provide the exact potential binding sites of the target RBP on the given sequence through the binding sites localization algorithm, and visualize it. In addition, the CRWS can discover the most widely distributed motif in each RBP dataset. Up to now, CRWS is the first significant online tool that uses multi-source data to train models and predict exact binding sites.

35294761,High-Throughput Screening Assay Profiling for Large Chemical Databases.,"High-throughput screening (HTS) techniques are increasingly being adopted by a variety of fields of toxicology. Notably, large-scale research efforts from government, industrial, and academic laboratories are screening millions of chemicals against a variety of biomolecular targets, producing an enormous amount of publicly available HTS assay data. These HTS assay data provide toxicologists important information on how chemicals interact with different biomolecular targets and provide illustrations of potential toxicity mechanisms. Open public data repositories, such as the National Institutes of Health's PubChem ( http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), were established to accept, store, and share HTS data. Through the PubChem website, users can rapidly obtain the PubChem assay results for compounds by using different chemical identifiers (including SMILES, InChIKey, IUPAC names, etc.). However, obtaining these data in a user-friendly format suitable for modeling and other informatics analysis (e.g., gathering PubChem data for hundreds or thousands of chemicals in a modeling friendly format) directly through the PubChem web portal is not feasible. This chapter aims to introduce two approaches to obtain the HTS assay results for large datasets of compounds from the PubChem portal. First, programmatic access via PubChem's PUG-REST web service using the Python programming language will be described.

36454444,A network map of discoidin domain receptor 1(DDR1)-mediated signaling in pathological conditions.,"Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is one of the receptors that belong to a family of non-integrin collagen receptors. In common, DDR1 is predominantly found in epithelial and smooth muscle cells and its mainly involved in organogenesis during embryonic development. However, it's also overexpressed in several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammation. The DDR1 is reported in numerous cancers, including breast, prostate, pancreatic, bladder, lung, liver, pituitary, colorectal, skin, gastric, glioblastoma, and inflammation. DDR1 activates through the collagen I, IV, IGF-1/IGF1R, and IGF2/IR, regulating downstream signaling molecules such as MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and NF-kB in diseases. Despite its biomedical importance, there is a lack of consolidated network map of the DDR1 signaling pathway, which prompted us for curation of literature data pertaining to the DDR1 system following the NetPath criteria. We present here the compiled pathway map comprises 39 activation/inhibition events, 17 catalysis events, 22 molecular associations, 65 gene regulation events, 35 types of protein expression, and two protein translocation events.

40157887,An automatic annotation tool and reference database for T cell subtypes and states at single-cell resolution.,"T cells have various subtypes and states with different functions. However, a reference list and automated annotation tool for T cell subtypes and states are lacking, which is critical for analyzing and comparing T cells under various conditions. We constructed the largest human T cell reference, containing 1,348,268 T cells from 35 conditions and 16 tissues. We classified T cells into 33 subtypes and further stratified them into 68 categories according to subtype and state. Based on this reference, we developed a tool named STCAT to automatically annotate T cells from scRNA-seq data by hierarchical models and marker correction. The accuracy of STCAT was 28% higher than that of existing tools validated on six independent datasets, including cancer and healthy samples. Using STCAT, we consistently discovered that CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells were enriched in late-stage lung cancer patients in multiple datasets, whereas MAIT cells were prevalent in milder-stage COVID-19 patients. We also confirmed a decrease in Treg cytotoxicity in post-treatment ovarian cancer. Systematic landscape analyses of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell references revealed that CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells were enriched in tumor samples and that CD8<sup>+</sup> naive-related cells were abundant in healthy individuals. Finally, we deposited all the T cell references and annotations into a TCellAtlas (https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCellAtlas) database, which allows users to browse T cell expression profiles and analyze customized scRNA-seq data by STCAT.

38504112,Enriched atlas of lncRNA and protein-coding genes for the GRCg7b chicken assembly and its functional annotation across 47 tissues.,"Gene atlases for livestock are steadily improving thanks to new genome assemblies and new expression data improving the gene annotation. However, gene content varies across databases due to differences in RNA sequencing data and bioinformatics pipelines, especially for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which have higher tissue and developmental specificity and are harder to consistently identify compared to protein coding genes (PCGs). As done previously in 2020 for chicken assemblies galgal5 and GRCg6a, we provide a new gene atlas, lncRNA-enriched, for the latest GRCg7b chicken assembly, integrating ""NCBI RefSeq"", ""EMBL-EBI Ensembl/GENCODE"" reference annotations and other resources such as FAANG and NONCODE. As a result, the number of PCGs increases from 18,022 (RefSeq) and 17,007 (Ensembl) to 24,102, and that of lncRNAs from 5789 (RefSeq) and 11,944 (Ensembl) to 44,428. Using 1400 public RNA-seq transcriptome representing 47 tissues, we provided expression evidence for 35,257 (79%) lncRNAs and 22,468 (93%) PCGs, supporting the relevance of this atlas.

While affinity-purification mass spectrometry has become instrumental in characterizing such interactions, it suffers from limitations in scalability and biological authenticity. Here we present the use of co-fractionation mass spectrometry for high throughput analysis of host-pathogen interactions from native viral infections of two jumbophages (ϕKZ and ϕPA3) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This approach enabled the detection of > 6000 unique host-pathogen interactions for each phage, encompassing > 50% of their respective proteomes. This deep coverage provided evidence for interactions between KZ-like phage proteins and the host ribosome, and revealed protein complexes for previously undescribed phage ORFs, including a ϕPA3 complex showing strong structural and sequence similarity to ϕKZ non-virion RNA polymerase. Interactome-wide comparison across phages showed similar perturbed protein interactions suggesting fundamentally conserved mechanisms of phage predation within the KZ-like phage family. To enable accessibility to this data, we developed PhageMAP, an online resource for network query, visualization, and interaction prediction ( https://phagemap.ucsf.edu/ ).

40996715,"A new database of chestnut DNA fingerprints for genetic diversity assessment, precise varietal identification, and traceability.","The European chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill., Fagaceae) is ecologically and economically important, particularly in countries like Italy, Greece, Spain, and Turkey, where it supports rural economies and ecosystems. Accurate varietal recognition is crucial for managing chestnut groves but is hindered by the limitations of traditional methods, which require costly expertise and struggle to identify young, dormant, or scion trees. Recent advances in molecular tools, particularly single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identified through Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) technology, have transformed cultivar identification. To harness this potential, we developed KASTRACKdb, a genetic fingerprinting database for European chestnut that now integrates genotypic and phenotypic data for 150 chestnut accessions. Designed to translate KASP analysis results into practical and actionable insights, KASTRACKdb serves as a powerful tool for cultivar identification and management. The database offers three primary query modes and is designed for continuous upgrades, serving a crucial role in cataloguing the genetic diversity of chestnut trees, characterized by broad geographic distributions and significant genetic variation. This diversity is critical for conservation and breeding programs, enabling precise varietal identification and traceability to protect intellectual property, verify authenticity, and support the commercialization of high-value cultivars.

39867820,A Database on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance in Wastewater and Solid Waste from Pharmaceutical Industry Based on a Systematic Review.,"Residual antimicrobial agents in wastewater and solid waste from antimicrobial manufacturing facilities can potentially contaminate environments. The World Health Organization has established technical guidelines for managing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in pharmaceutical wastewater and solid waste. However, the scarcity of publicly available data on antimicrobial manufacturing processes impedes the development of effective mitigation strategies. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a comprehensive database documenting antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in actual wastewater and solid waste samples, primarily fermentation residues. Through systematic review methodology, we compiled data from extensive searches of English-language article databases, including Web of Science and PubMed. The database contains data from 270 distinct samples collected across 45 fermentation residue treatment systems and 46 wastewater treatment systems, derived from 70 published English-language articles spanning 2008 to 2024. In operational pharmaceutical facilities, antibiotic concentrations ranged from 82 to 1,663 mg/L in raw wastewater and from 1,000 to 10,182 mg/kg dry matter (DM) in antibiotic fermentation residues. Various treatment technologies demonstrated significant reductions in both antibiotic concentrations and ARG levels within wastes. This database provides the first global perspective on antibiotic and ARG contamination from antibiotic production processes, supporting AMR management initiatives.

34904638,Generation of ENSEMBL-based proteogenomics databases boosts the identification of non-canonical peptides.,"<h4>Summary</h4>We have implemented the pypgatk package and the pgdb workflow to create proteogenomics databases based on ENSEMBL resources. The tools allow the generation of protein sequences from novel protein-coding transcripts by performing a three-frame translation of pseudogenes, lncRNAs and other non-canonical transcripts, such as those produced by alternative splicing events. It also includes exonic out-of-frame translation from otherwise canonical protein-coding mRNAs. Moreover, the tool enables the generation of variant protein sequences from multiple sources of genomic variants including COSMIC, cBioportal, gnomAD and mutations detected from sequencing of patient samples. pypgatk and pgdb provide multiple functionalities for database handling including optimized target/decoy generation by the algorithm DecoyPyrat. Finally, we have reanalyzed six public datasets in PRIDE by generating cell-type specific databases for 65 cell lines using the pypgatk and pgdb workflow, revealing a wealth of non-canonical or cryptic peptides amounting to >5% of the total number of peptides identified.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is freely available. pypgatk: https://github.com/bigbio/py-pgatk/ and pgdb: https://nf-co.re/pgdb.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,4.0,,cbioportal | decoypyrat | https://github.com/bigbio/py-pgatk/,cosmic | gnomad | pride,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,https://nf-co.re/pgdb,https://nf-co.re/pgdb,True,...tk: https://github.com/bigbio/py-pgatk/ and pgdb: https://nf-co.re/pgdb.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1

38886537,A comprehensive whole genome database of ethnic minority populations.,"China, is characterized by its remarkable ethnical diversity, which necessitates whole genome variation data from multiple populations as crucial tools for advancing population genetics and precision medical research. However, there has been a scarcity of research concentrating on the whole genome of ethnic minority groups. To fill this gap, we developed the Guizhou Multi-ethnic Genome Database (GMGD). It comprises whole genome sequencing data from 476 healthy unrelated individuals spanning 11 ethnic minorities groups in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, including Bouyei, Dong, Miao, Yi, Bai, Gelo, Zhuang, Tujia, Yao, Hui, and Sui. The GMGD database comprises more than 16.33 million variants in GRCh38 and 16.20 million variants in GRCh37. Among these, approximately 11.9% (1,956,322) of the variants in GRCh38 and 18.5% (3,009,431) of the variants in GRCh37 are entirely new and do not exist in the dbSNP database. These novel variants shed light on the genetic diversity landscape across these populations, providing valuable insights with an average coverage of 5.5 ×. This makes GMGD the largest genome-wide database encompassing the most diverse ethnic groups to date. The GMGD interactive interface facilitates researchers with multi-dimensional mutation search methods and displays population frequency differences among global populations. Furthermore, GMGD is equipped with a genotype-imputation function, enabling enhanced capabilities for low-depth genomic research or targeted region capture studies.

40181211,Health Impact Database Development for Sweeteners and Sweetness Enhancers: The SWEET Project.,"Sweeteners and sweetness enhancers (S&SEs) are ingredients used in foods and beverages to reduce sugar while providing the sweetness of sugar with little to no calories. Although S&SEs have global regulatory approval and acceptance, questions remain regarding their overall safety and efficacy. Information on the effects of S&SEs in regard to health and efficacy can be found in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that exist in peer-reviewed literature. With the large number of RCT publications on various S&SEs, a need exists to organise and collect each of the published studies in a useful database. Currently, a database containing human clinical information on S&SEs does not exist and so The SWEET project has created a publicly available and comprehensive Health Impact Database that includes available human clinical information on sweeteners. This paper describes the process and development of a database that collects comprehensive information on published human clinical studies evaluating S&SEs between the years January 2000 and September 2024. Ovid Medline was used to search for RCT publications from the year 2000 to 2024. The search produced 1538 publications, of which 257 complied with the predetermined eligibility criteria. There was a large variability in the number of studies that fit the inclusion criteria. For example, some S&SEs had numerous studies (i.e., sucralose, n = 63 eligible publications) and some S&SEs had no publications that fit the criteria (aspartame-acesulfame K salt and neohesperidine DC). The Health Impact Database is located at https://sweetproject.eu/HIdatabase and is contained in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets which are organised by health impact criteria.

37953362,"A new paradigm for molecular dynamics databases: the COVID-19 database, the legacy of a titanic community effort.","Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are keeping computers busy around the world, generating a huge amount of data that is typically not open to the scientific community. Pioneering efforts to ensure the safety and reusability of MD data have been based on the use of simple databases providing a limited set of standard analyses on single-short trajectories. Despite their value, these databases do not offer a true solution for the current community of MD users, who want a flexible analysis pipeline and the possibility to address huge non-Markovian ensembles of large systems. Here we present a new paradigm for MD databases, resilient to large systems and long trajectories, and designed to be compatible with modern MD simulations. The data are offered to the community through a web-based graphical user interface (GUI), implemented with state-of-the-art technology, which incorporates system-specific analysis designed by the trajectory providers.

Identifying final common pathways/molecular signatures that integrate this heterogeneity informs biomarker and therapeutic-target development. We present the first large-scale murine single-cell atlas of the transcriptomic response to TBI (334,376 cells) across clinically relevant models, sex, brain region, and time as a foundational step in molecularly deconstructing TBI heterogeneity. Results were unique to cell populations, injury models, sex, brain regions, and time, highlighting the importance of cell-level resolution. We identify cell-specific targets and previously unrecognized roles for microglial and ependymal subtypes. Ependymal-4 was a hub of neuroinflammatory signaling.

36480100,A molecular network map of orexin-orexin receptor signaling system.,"Orexins are excitatory neuropeptides, which are predominantly associated with feeding behavior, sleep-wake cycle and energy homeostasis. The orexinergic system comprises of HCRTR1 and HCRTR2, G-protein-coupled receptors of rhodopsin family and the endogenous ligands processed from HCRT pro-hormone, Orexin A and Orexin B. These neuropeptides are biosynthesized by the orexin neurons present in the lateral hypothalamus area, with dense projections to other brain regions. The orexin-receptor signaling is implicated in various metabolic as well as neurological disorders, making it a promising target for pharmacological interventions. However, there is limited information available on the collective representation of the signal transduction pathways pertaining to the orexin-orexin receptor signaling system. Here, we depict a compendium of the Orexin A/B stimulated reactions in the form of a basic signaling pathway map. This map catalogs the reactions into five categories: molecular association, activation/inhibition, catalysis, transport, and gene regulation. A total of 318 downstream molecules were annotated adhering to the guidelines of NetPath curation.

35595749,A 3D gene expression atlas of the floral meristem based on spatial reconstruction of single nucleus RNA sequencing data.,"Cellular heterogeneity in growth and differentiation results in organ patterning. Single-cell transcriptomics allows characterization of gene expression heterogeneity in developing organs at unprecedented resolution. However, the original physical location of the cell is lost during this methodology. To recover the original location of cells in the developing organ is essential to link gene activity with cellular identity and function in plants. Here, we propose a method to reconstruct genome-wide gene expression patterns of individual cells in a 3D flower meristem by combining single-nuclei RNA-seq with microcopy-based 3D spatial reconstruction. By this, gene expression differences among meristematic domains giving rise to different tissue and organ types can be determined.

36693896,A database of synthetic inelastic neutron scattering spectra from molecules and crystals.,"Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a powerful tool to study the vibrational dynamics in a material. The analysis and interpretation of the INS spectra, however, are often nontrivial. Unlike diffraction, for which one can quickly calculate the scattering pattern from the structure, the calculation of INS spectra from the structure involves multiple steps requiring significant experience and computational resources. To overcome this barrier, a database of INS spectra consisting of commonly seen materials will be a valuable reference, and it will also lay the foundation of advanced data-driven analysis and interpretation of INS spectra. Here we report such a database compiled for over 20,000 organic molecules and over 10,000 inorganic crystals. The INS spectra are obtained from a streamlined workflow, and the synthetic INS spectra are also verified by available experimental data. The database is expected to greatly facilitate INS data analysis, and it can also enable the utilization of advanced analytics such as data mining and machine learning.Notice: This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

40626310,Understanding the treatment of acute pancreatitis and its complications -a database for assessing traditional Chinese medicine use.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Integrative medicine combining traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with biomedicine has become a notable approach for treating acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the absence of a comprehensive and reliable database to store and organize TCM-related data for the prevention and treatment of AP presents a significant challenge for the development of herbal medicines. To develop a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for browsing, querying, and analyzing TCM-related data for treating AP.<h4>Methods</h4>TCM-related data for treating AP were systematically extracted from the literature and established databases. The front-end interface was developed using HyperText Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript to enhance user experience. The back-end employed Hypertext Preprocessor and My Structured Query Language for improved performance and security. The Smarty template engine was utilized to separate the front-end and back-end, facilitating efficient updates to the TCMAP platform.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>The current version of the TCMAP includes: (i) documentation of 200 evidence-based TCM formulations, with comprehensive details on clinical applications, targets related to AP, and target pathway enrichment analysis, including 449 herbs; (ii) records of 58 natural metabolites, involving extensive information on their potential targets and pharmacological properties; and (iii) integration with a web server enables users to conduct similarity and enrichment analyses of input prescriptions based on herbs, metabolites, and genes. Furthermore, TCMAP also supports discovering anti-AP herb pairs with similar metabolites and targets. Network analysis further provides users with the intrinsic properties of anti-AP formulations. The TCMAP provides a robust data platform for predicting new metabolites and exploring the potential mechanisms of TCM in treating AP.

39660217,<b>Y</b>ab<b>X</b>nization platform: A monoclonal antibody heterologization server based on rational design and artificial intelligence-assisted computation.,"The application of antibody therapeutics is promising in the field of immunotherapy. While, heterologization should be done in most cases before applying the therapeutic antibodies into bodies, e.g., humanization, caninization and felinization for human beings, canine and feline, respectively. Here we report YabXnization, the platform which realizes antibody heterologization on the basis of rational design and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted computation. YabXnization provides two ways for heterologization: traditional CDR-grafting and backmutation-based rational design; and AI-assisted fusion computational design. Taking humanization as example, both of the two ways first find the proper template for heavy and light chains with CDR-grafting followed. For rational design, bioinformatics analysis-based backmutation is then conducted. For AI-assisted computational design, the backmutation and humanness evaluation are implemented through evolutionary computation framework with DeepForest-based humanness evaluation model and the distance to the previously found human template as objective functions. Finally, the top <i>K</i> heterologized antibodies can be provided by YabXnization platform. We examined the platform with 18 antibodies to be heterologized, in which 10 for humanization, 6 for caninization and 2 for felinization, respectively. The heterologized antibodies were measured by indirect ELISA and BLI(Octet)/SPR(Biacore) binding affinity measurement methods. Test results show a 90% success rate with the binding affinity loss of heterologized antibodies within an order of magnitude compared to the corresponding chimeric antibodies. It even shows an increase in the binding affinity on some of the heterologized antibodies.

38809899,Mapping the evidence on factors related to postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women in the United States of America: A scoping review protocol.,"<h4>Background</h4>Postpartum contraception is essential to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care because it encourages healthy spacing between births, helps women avoid unwanted pregnancies, and lessens the risks of health problems for mothers and babies. Sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee populations are rapidly increasing in the United States, and they come from a wide range of cultural, linguistic, religious, and social origins, which may pose challenges in timely access to culturally acceptable SRH care, for preventing mistimed or unwanted childbearing. The objective of this scoping review is to assess the extent of the available literature on postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women living in the United States.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed preliminary search terms with the help of an expert librarian, consisting of keywords including birth intervals, birth spacing, contraception, postpartum contraception or family planning, and USA or America, and sub-Saharan African immigrants, or emigrants. The study will include the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Global Health Database. The sources will include studies on postpartum care and contraceptive access and utilization among sub-Saharan African immigrants living in the US. Citations, abstracts, and full texts will be independently screened by two reviewers. We will use narrative synthesis to analyze the data using quantitative and qualitative methods. Factors associated with postpartum contraception will be organized using the domains and constructs of the PEN-3 Model as a guiding framework.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This scoping review will map the research on postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women living in the US. We expect to identify knowledge gaps, and barriers and facilitators of postpartum contraception in this population. Based on the findings of the review, recommendations will be made for advocacy and program and policy development toward optimizing interpregnancy intervals in sub-Saharan African immigrants living in the US.<h4>Trial registration</h4>Review registration Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/s385j.",True,False,3.5,,psycinfo | global health database | review registration open science framework,,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Mapping the evidence on factors related to postpartum contraception among sub-Saharan African immigrant and refugee women in the United States of America,False,0.0,False,False,https://osf.io/s385j,https://osf.io/s385j,True,...n</h4>Review registration Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/s385j.,1
35352997,Microbial Identification Using rRNA Operon Region: Database and Tool for Metataxonomics with Long-Read Sequence.,"Recent development of long-read sequencing platforms has enabled researchers to explore bacterial community structure through analysis of full-length 16S rRNA gene (∼1,500 bp) or 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region (∼4,300 bp), resulting in higher taxonomic resolution than short-read sequencing platforms. Despite the potential of long-read sequencing in metagenomics, resources and protocols for this technology are scarce. Here, we describe MIrROR, the database and analysis tool for metataxonomics using the bacterial 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region. We collected 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon sequences extracted from bacterial genomes from NCBI GenBank and performed curation. A total of 97,781 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon sequences covering 9,485 species from 43,653 genomes were obtained. For user convenience, we provide an analysis tool based on a mapping strategy that can be used for taxonomic profiling with MIrROR database. To benchmark MIrROR, we compared performance against publicly available databases and tool with mock communities and simulated data sets. Our platform showed promising results in terms of the number of species covered and the accuracy of classification. To encourage active 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon analysis in the field, BLAST function and taxonomic profiling results with 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon studies, which have been reported as BioProject on NCBI are provided. MIrROR (http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/) will be a useful platform for researchers who want to perform high-resolution metagenome analysis with a cost-effective sequencer such as MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Metabarcoding is a powerful tool to investigate community diversity in an economic and efficient way by amplifying a specific gene marker region. With the advancement of long-read sequencing technologies, the field of metabarcoding has entered a new phase. The technologies have brought a need for development in several areas, including new markers that long-read can cover, database for the markers, tools that reflect long-read characteristics, and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. By constructing MIrROR, we met the need for a database and tools for the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region, which has recently been shown to have sufficient resolution at the species level. Bacterial community analysis using the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon region with MIrROR will provide new insights from various research fields.",True,False,4.0,,genbank | bioproject,mirror,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Microbial Identification Using rRNA Operon Region,True,5.0,False,False,http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/,http://mirror.egnome.co.kr/,True,...orted as BioProject on NCBI are provided.

35435220,An atlas of human viruses provides new insights into diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Viruses continue to threaten human health. Yet, the complete viral species carried by humans and their infection characteristics have not been fully revealed.<h4>Results</h4>This study curated an atlas of human viruses from public databases and literature, and built the Human Virus Database (HVD). The HVD contains 1131 virus species of 54 viral families which were more than twice the number of the human-infecting virus species reported in previous studies. These viruses were identified in human samples including 68 human tissues, the excreta and body fluid. The viral diversity in humans was age-dependent with a peak in the infant and a valley in the teenager. The tissue tropism of viruses was found to be associated with several factors including the viral group (DNA, RNA or reverse-transcribing viruses), enveloped or not, viral genome length and GC content, viral receptors and the virus-interacting proteins. Finally, the tissue tropism of DNA viruses was predicted using a random-forest algorithm with a middle performance. Overall, the study not only provides a valuable resource for further studies of human viruses but also deepens our understanding toward the diversity and tissue tropism of human viruses.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The HVD is available at http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",True,False,5.0,,human virus database,hvd,6.0,conflict,hvd | human virus database,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/,http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/,True,...ty and implementation</h4>The HVD is available at http://computationalbiology.cn/humanVirusBase/#/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary d...,1
39139072,Comparative transcriptome database for Camellia sinensis reveals genes related to the cold sensitivity and albino mechanism of 'Anji Baicha'.,"Tea, a globally popular beverage, contains various beneficial secondary metabolites. Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) exhibit diverse genetic traits across cultivars, impacting yield, adaptability, morphology, and secondary metabolite composition. Many tea cultivars have been the subject of much research interest, which have led to the accumulation of publicly available RNA-seq data. As such, it has become possible to systematically summarize the characteristics of different cultivars at the transcriptomic level, identify functional genes, and infer gene functions through co-expression analysis. Here, the transcriptomes of 9 tea cultivars were assembled, and comparative analysis was conducted on the coding sequences of 13 cultivars. To give access to this data, we present TeaNekT (https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/), a web resource that facilitates the prediction of gene functions of various tea cultivars. We used TeaNekT to perform a cross-cultivar comparison of co-expressed gene clusters and tissue-specific gene expression. We observed that 'Anji Baicha' possesses the highest number of cultivar-specific genes and the second-highest number of expanded genes. These genes in 'Anji Baicha' tend to be enriched in functions associated with cold stress response, chloroplast thylakoid structure, and nitrogen metabolism. Notably, we identified three significantly expanded homologous genes in 'Anji Baicha' encoding the ICE1, SIZ1, and MAPKK2, which are closely associated with the cold sensitivity of 'Anji Baicha'. Additionally, one significantly expanded homologous gene in 'Anji Baicha' encoding regulatory factor RIQ may play a crucial role in the abnormal chloroplast structure and absence of thylakoid membranes in 'Anji Baicha'.",True,False,3.0,,teanekt,siz1,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/,https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/,True,"...To give access to this data, we present TeaNekT (https://teanekt.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/), a web resource that facilitates the prediction...",1

GDNF/RET signaling is vital to the central and peripheral nervous system, kidney morphogenesis, and spermatogenesis. In addition, the dysregulation of the GDNF/RET signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers. Despite the extensive research on GDNF/RET signaling, a molecular network of reactions induced by GDNF reported across the published literature. However, a comprehensive GDNF/RET pathway resource is currently unavailable. We describe an integrated signaling pathway reaction map of GDNF/RET consisting of 1151 molecular reactions. These include information pertaining to 52 molecular association events, 70 enzyme catalysis events, 36 activation/inhibition events, 22 translocation events, 856 gene regulation events, and 115 protein-level expression events induced by GDNF in diverse cell types.
