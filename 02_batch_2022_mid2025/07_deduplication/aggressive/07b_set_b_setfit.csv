Here, we fill this gap by presenting Course-Skill Atlas - a longitudinal dataset of skills inferred from over three million course syllabi taught at nearly three thousand U.S. higher education institutions. To construct Course-Skill Atlas, we apply natural language processing to quantify the alignment between course syllabi and detailed workplace activities (DWAs) used by the DOL to describe occupations. We then aggregate these alignment scores to create skill profiles for institutions and academic majors. Our dataset offers a large-scale representation of college education's role in preparing students for the labor market.

Accurate identification of cell types is critical for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. However, scRNA-seq data are usually high dimensional and sparse, posing a great challenge to analyze scRNA-seq data. Existing cell-type annotation methods are either constrained in modeling scRNA-seq data or lack consideration of long-term dependencies of characterized genes. In this work, we developed a Transformer-based deep learning method, scSwinFormer, for the cell-type annotation of large-scale scRNA-seq data. Sequence modeling of scRNA-seq data is performed using the smooth gene embedding module, and then, the potential dependencies of genes are captured by the self-attention module. Subsequently, the global information inherent in scRNA-seq data is synthesized using the Cell Token, thereby facilitating accurate cell-type annotation. We evaluated the performance of our model against current state-of-the-art scRNA-seq cell-type annotation methods on multiple real data sets. ScSwinFormer outperforms the current state-of-the-art scRNA-seq cell-type annotation methods in both external and benchmark data set experiments.",False,True,,0.6966398,scswinformer,,20.99417377,ok,,transformer,,spacy+v2,0.99417377,scSwinFormer,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

Such delineation is provided by the peptide-based clustering method CUPP, Conserved Unique Peptide Patterns. CUPP operates synergistically with the CAZy family/subfamily categorizations to allow systematic exploration of CAZymes by defining small protein groups with shared sequence motifs. The updated CUPP library contains 21,930 of such motif groups including 3,842,628 proteins. The new implementation of the CUPP-webserver, https://cupp.info/, now includes all published fungal and algal genomes from the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), genome resources MycoCosm and PhycoCosm, dynamically subdivided into motif groups of CAZymes. This allows users to browse the JGI portals for specific predicted functions or specific protein families from genome sequences. Thus, a genome can be searched for proteins having specific characteristics. All JGI proteins have a hyperlink to a summary page which links to the predicted gene splicing including which regions have RNA support. The new CUPP implementation also includes an update of the annotation algorithm that uses only a fourth of the RAM while enabling multi-threading, providing an annotation speed below 1 ms/protein.",False,True,,0.72213554,conserved unique peptide patterns,,20.85037714,ok,cupp | conserved unique peptide patterns,mycocosm | phycocosm | unique peptide patterns,cupp | cazy | ram,spacy+v2,0.85037714,Conserved unique peptide patterns (CUPP) online platform,False,0.0,False,False,https://cupp.info/,https://cupp.info/,True,"...ns.

A yeast optogenetic toolkit (yOTK) allows rapid assembly of optogenetic constructs using Modular Cloning, or MoClo. In this protocol, we describe how to assemble, integrate, and test optogenetic systems in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Generating an optogenetic system requires the user to first define the structure of the final construct and identify all basic parts and vectors required for the construction strategy, including light-sensitive proteins that need to be domesticated into the toolkit. The assembly is then defined following a set of standard rules. Multigene constructs are assembled using a series of one-pot assembly steps with the identified parts and vectors and transformed into yeast.

That is why research to improve our understanding of pathophysiological processes underlying cardiac diseases is of great importance. There is a strong need for healthy and diseased human cardiac tissue and related clinical data to accomplish this, since currently used animal and in vitro disease models do not fully grasp the pathophysiological processes observed in humans. This design paper describes the initiative of the Netherlands Heart Tissue Bank (NHTB) that aims to boost CVD-related research by providing an open-access biobank.<h4>Methods</h4>The NHTB, founded in June 2020, is a non-profit biobank that collects and stores biomaterial (including but not limited to myocardial tissue and blood samples) and clinical data of individuals with and without previously known cardiac diseases. All individuals aged ≥ 18 years living in the Netherlands are eligible for inclusion as a potential future donor. The stored samples and clinical data will be available upon request for cardiovascular researchers.<h4>Conclusion</h4>To improve the availability of cardiac tissue for cardiovascular research, the NHTB will include extensive (cardiac) biosamples, medical images, and clinical data of donors with and without a previously known cardiac disease.

36223196,Envemind: Accurate Monoisotopic Mass Determination Based On Isotopic Envelope.,"Nowadays, monoisotopic mass is used as an important feature in top-down proteomics. Knowing the exact monoisotopic mass is helpful for precise and quick protein identification in large protein databases. However, only in spectra of small molecules the monoisotopic peak is visible. For bigger molecules like proteins, it is hidden in noise or undetected at all, and therefore its position has to be predicted. By improving the prediction of the peak, we contribute to a more accurate identification of molecules, which is crucial in fields such as chemistry and medicine. In this work, we present the envemind algorithm, which is a two-step procedure to predict monoisotopic masses of proteins. The prediction is based on an isotopic envelope. Therefore, envemind is dedicated to spectra where we are able to resolve the one dalton separated isotopic variants. Furthermore, only single-molecule spectra are allowed, that is, spectra that do not require prior deconvolution. The algorithm deals with the problem of off-by-one dalton errors, which are common in monoisotopic mass prediction. A novel aspect of this work is a mathematical exploration of the space of molecules, where we equate chemical formulas and their theoretical spectrum. Since the space of molecules consists of all possible chemical formulas, this approach is not limited to known substances only. This makes optimization processes faster and enables to approximate theoretical spectrum for a given experimental one.

In particular, metagenome-assembled genomes are typically incomplete and harbor partial gene sequences that can limit their annotation from traditional tools. New scalable solutions are thus needed to facilitate the evaluation of functional potential in microbial genomes.<h4>Methods</h4>To resolve annotation gaps in microbial genomes, we developed KEMET, an open-source Python library devised for the analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional units. KEMET focuses on the in-depth analysis of metabolic reaction networks to identify missing orthologs through hidden Markov model profiles.<h4>Results</h4>We evaluate the potential of KEMET for expanding functional annotations by simulating the effect of assembly issues on real gene sequences and showing that our approach can identify missing KEGG orthologs. Additionally, we show that recovered gene annotations can sensibly increase the quality of draft genome-scale metabolic models obtained from metagenome-assembled genomes, in some cases reaching the accuracy of models generated from complete genomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>KEMET therefore allows expanding genome annotations by targeted searches for orthologous sequences, enabling a better qualitative and quantitative assessment of metabolic capabilities in novel microbial organisms.",False,True,,0.72497696,,kemet,17.9961183,ok,,kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes,kegg | emet,v2,0.9961183,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To make this process more rational and efficient, scientists always look for new and better ways to design novel ligands for a target of interest. Among different approaches, de novo ones gained popularity in the last decade, thanks to their ability to efficiently explore the chemical space and their increasing reliability in generating high-quality compounds. Autogrow4 is open-source software for de novo drug design that generates ligands for a given target by exploiting a combination of a genetic algorithm and molecular docking calculations.<h4>Areas covered</h4>In the present paper, the authors dissect this program's usefulness and limitations in generating new compounds from a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic perspective. Specifically, this article examines all reported applications of the Autogrow code in the literature (as retrieved from the Scopus database) from the release of its first version in 2009 to the present.<h4>Expert opinion</h4>In the hands of an expert molecular modeler, Autogrow4 is a useful tool for de novo ligand design. Its modular and open-source codebase offers many protocol customization features. The main downsides are limited control over the pharmacokinetic features of generated ligands and the bias toward high molecular weight compounds.",False,True,,0.69091797,autogrow4,,17.9617374,ok,,,code,v2,0.9617374,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36447388,KID: A Kinase-Focused Interaction Database and Its Application in the Construction of Kinase-Focused Molecule Databases.,"Protein kinases are important drug targets for the treatment of several diseases. The interaction between kinases and ligands is vital in the process of small-molecule kinase inhibitor (SMKI) design. In this study, we propose a method to extract fragments and amino acid residues from crystal structures for kinase-ligand interactions. In addition, core fragments that interact with the important hinge region of kinases were extracted along with their decorations. Based on the superimposed structural data of kinases from the kinase-ligand interaction fingerprint and structure database, we obtained two libraries, namely, a hinge-unfocused fragment-amino acid pair library (FAP Lib) that contains 6672 pairs of fragments and corresponding amino-acids, and a hinge-focused hinge binder library (HB Lib) of 3560 pairs of hinge-binding scaffolds with their corresponding decorations. These two libraries constitute a kinase-focused interaction database (KID). In depth analysis was conducted on KID to explore important characteristics of fragments in the design of SMKIs.

39154033,LLM-Twin: mini-giant model-driven beyond 5G digital twin networking framework with semantic secure communication and computation.,"Beyond 5G networks provide solutions for next-generation communications, especially digital twins networks (DTNs) have gained increasing popularity for bridging physical and digital space. However, current DTNs pose some challenges, especially when applied to scenarios that require efficient and multimodal data processing. Firstly, current DTNs are limited in communication and computational efficiency, since they require to transmit large amounts of raw data collected from physical sensors, as well as to ensure model synchronization through high-frequency computation. Second, current models of DTNs are domain-specific (e.g. E-health), making it difficult to handle DT scenarios with multimodal data processing requirements. Finally, current security schemes for DTNs introduce additional overheads that impair the efficiency. Against the above challenges, we propose a large language model (LLM) empowered DTNs framework, LLM-Twin. First, based on LLM, we propose digital twin semantic networks (DTSNs), which enable more efficient communication and computation. Second, we design a mini-giant model collaboration scheme, which enables efficient deployment of LLM in DTNs and is adapted to handle multimodal data. Then, we designed a native security policy for LLM-twin without compromising efficiency. Numerical experiments and case studies demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-Twin. To our knowledge, this is the first to propose an LLM-based semantic-level DTNs.",False,True,,0.6990902,llm-twin,,17.865006270000002,ok,,,llm,v2,0.86500627,LLM-Twin,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

While databases like PhosphoSitePlus contain information about many phosphorylation sites, the vast majority of known sites is not assigned to any protein kinase. Assigning changes in the phosphoproteome to the activity of individual kinases therefore remains a key challenge. A recent large-scale study systematically identified in vitro substrates for most human protein kinases. Here, we reprocessed and filtered these data to generate an <i>in vitro Kinase-to-Phosphosite database</i> (iKiP-DB). We show that iKiP-DB can accurately predict changes in kinase activity in published phosphoproteomic data sets for both well-studied and poorly characterized kinases. We apply iKiP-DB to a newly generated phosphoproteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung epithelial cells and provide evidence for coronavirus-induced changes in host cell kinase activity.

Intelligent auscultation algorithms have been proven to reduce the subjectivity of diagnoses and alleviate the workload of doctors. However, the development of this algorithm has been limited by the lack of reliable, standardized, and publicly available pediatric heart sound databases. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a large-scale, high-standard, high-quality, and accurately labeled pediatric CHD heart sound database.<h4>Method</h4>From 2020 to 2022, we collaborated with experienced cardiac surgeons from three general children's hospitals to collect heart sound signals from 1259 participants using electronic stethoscopes. To ensure the accuracy of the labels, the labels for all data were confirmed by two cardiac experts. To establish the baseline of ZCHsound, we extracted 84 features and used machine learning models to evaluate the performance of the classification task.<h4>Results</h4>The ZCHSound database was divided into two datasets: one is a high-quality, filtered clean heart sound dataset, and the other is a low-quality, noisy heart sound dataset. In the evaluation of the high-quality dataset, our random forest ensemble model achieved an F1 score of 90.3% in the classification task of normal and pathological heart sounds.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study has successfully established a large-scale, high-quality, rigorously standardized pediatric CHD sound database with precise disease diagnosis.

38048333,HybridDBRpred: improved sequence-based prediction of DNA-binding amino acids using annotations from structured complexes and disordered proteins.,"Current predictors of DNA-binding residues (DBRs) from protein sequences belong to two distinct groups, those trained on binding annotations extracted from structured protein-DNA complexes (structure-trained) vs. intrinsically disordered proteins (disorder-trained). We complete the first empirical analysis of predictive performance across the structure- and disorder-annotated proteins for a representative collection of ten predictors. Majority of the structure-trained tools perform well on the structure-annotated proteins while doing relatively poorly on the disorder-annotated proteins, and vice versa. Several methods make accurate predictions for the structure-annotated proteins or the disorder-annotated proteins, but none performs highly accurately for both annotation types. Moreover, most predictors make excessive cross-predictions for the disorder-annotated proteins, where residues that interact with non-DNA ligand types are predicted as DBRs. Motivated by these results, we design, validate and deploy an innovative meta-model, hybridDBRpred, that uses deep transformer network to combine predictions generated by three best current predictors. HybridDBRpred provides accurate predictions and low levels of cross-predictions across the two annotation types, and is statistically more accurate than each of the ten tools and baseline meta-predictors that rely on averaging and logistic regression.

36171524,"The Order & Complexity Toolbox for Aesthetics (OCTA): A systematic approach to study the relations between order, complexity, and aesthetic appreciation.","Do individuals prefer stimuli that are ordered or disordered, simple or complex, or that strike the right balance of order and complexity? Earlier research mainly focused on the separate influence of order and complexity on aesthetic appreciation. When order and complexity were studied in combination, stimulus manipulations were often not parametrically controlled, only rather specific types of order (i.e., balance or symmetry) were usually studied, and/or the multidimensionality of order and complexity was largely ignored. Progress has also been limited by the lack of an easy way to create reproducible and expandible stimulus sets, including both order and complexity manipulations. The Order & Complexity Toolbox for Aesthetics (OCTA), a Python toolbox that is also available as a point-and-click Shiny application, aims to fill this gap. OCTA provides researchers with a free and easy way to create multi-element displays varying qualitatively (i.e., different types) and quantitatively (i.e., different levels) in order and complexity, based on regularity and variety along multiple element features (e.g., shape, size, color, orientation). The standard vector-based output is ideal for experiments on the web and the creation of dynamic interfaces and stimuli. OCTA will not only facilitate reproducible stimulus construction and experimental design in research on order, complexity, and aesthetics.

However, their computational identification remains a challenge. Based on a comprehensive analysis of known prokaryotic small ORFs, we have developed the ProsmORF-pred resource which uses a machine learning (ML)-based method for prediction of smORFs in the prokaryotic genome sequences. ProsmORF-pred consists of two ML models, one for initiation site recognition in nucleic acid sequences upstream of putative start codons and the other uses translated amino acid sequences to decipher functional protein like sequences. The nucleotide sequence-based initiation site recognition model has been trained using longer ORFs (>100 aa) in the same genome while the ML model for identification of protein like sequences has been trained using annotated smORFs from Escherichia coli. Comprehensive benchmarking of ProsmORF-pred reveals that its performance is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches on the annotated smORF set derived from 32 prokaryotic genomes. Its performance is distinctly superior to other tools like PRODIGAL and RANSEPS for prediction of newly identified smORFs which have a length range of 10-30 aa, where prediction of smORFs has been a major challenge. Apart from identification of smORFs in genomic sequences, ProsmORF-pred can also aid in functional annotation of the predicted smORFs based on sequence similarity and genomic neighbourhood similarity searches in ProsmORFDB, a well-curated database of known smORFs.

These steps improve the prediction of pupil size changes beyond the here-evaluated benchmarks. Open-DPSM provides Python functions, as well as a graphical user interface (GUI), enabling the extension of its applications to versatile scenarios and adaptations to individualized needs.

Histopathological examination of gastric cancer is the gold standard for the diagnosis of gastric cancer. However, computer-aided diagnostic techniques are challenging to evaluate due to the scarcity of publicly available gastric histopathology image datasets.<h4>Methods</h4>In this paper, a noble publicly available Gastric Histopathology Sub-size Image Database (GasHisSDB) is published to identify classifiers' performance. Specifically, two types of data are included: normal and abnormal, with a total of 245,196 tissue case images. In order to prove that the methods of different periods in the field of image classification have discrepancies on GasHisSDB, we select a variety of classifiers for evaluation.

39788105,CSI-GEP: A GPU-based unsupervised machine learning approach for recovering gene expression programs in atlas-scale single-cell RNA-seq data.,"Exploratory analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) typically relies on hard clustering over two-dimensional projections like uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). However, such methods can severely distort the data and have many arbitrary parameter choices. Methods that can model scRNA-seq data as non-discrete ""gene expression programs"" (GEPs) can better preserve the data's structure, but currently, they are often not scalable, not consistent across repeated runs, and lack an established method for choosing key parameters. Here, we developed a GPU-based unsupervised learning approach, ""consensus and scalable inference of gene expression programs"" (CSI-GEP). We show that CSI-GEP can recover ground truth GEPs in real and simulated atlas-scale scRNA-seq datasets, significantly outperforming cutting-edge methods, including GPT-based neural networks. We applied CSI-GEP to a whole mouse brain atlas of 2.2 million cells, disentangling endothelial cell types missed by other methods, and to an integrated scRNA-seq atlas of human tumors and cell lines, discovering mesenchymal-like GEPs unique to cancer cells growing in culture.",False,True,,0.69371575,,csi-gep,16.9965355,ok,,,csi | gpu | gep,v2,0.9965355,CSI-GEP,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

40067703,ESIQA: Perceptual Quality Assessment of Vision-Pro-based Egocentric Spatial Images.,"With the development of eXtended Reality (XR), photo capturing and display technology based on head-mounted displays (HMDs) have experienced significant advancements and gained considerable attention. Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. The assessment for the Quality of Experience (QoE) of XR content is important to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images and the corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) under three display modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Based on our ESIQAD, we propose a novel mamba2-based multi-stage feature fusion model, termed ESIQAnet, which predicts the perceptual quality of egocentric spatial images under the three display modes. Specifically, we first extract features from multiple visual state space duality (VSSD) blocks, then apply cross attention to fuse binocular view information and use transposed attention to further refine the features. The multi-stage features are finally concatenated and fed into a quality regression network to predict the quality score. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ESIQAnet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art IQA models on the ESIQAD under all three display modes.

Despite centralization efforts from multiple organizations and increased transparency requirements from funding agencies and publishers, analysis of public PDAC data remains difficult. Bioinformatic pitfalls litter public transcriptomic data, such as subtle inclusion of low-purity and non-adenocarcinoma cases.

The TOol for PArticle Simulation (TOPAS) is a Geant4-based Monte Carlo software application that has been used for both research and clinical studies in medical physics. So far, most users of TOPAS have focused on radiotherapy-related studies, such as modeling radiation therapy delivery systems or patient dose calculation. Here, we present the first set of TOPAS extensions to make it easier for TOPAS users to model medical imaging systems.<i>Approach</i>. We used the extension system of TOPAS to implement pre-built, user-configurable geometry components such as detectors (e.g. flat-panel and multi-planar detectors) for various imaging modalities and pre-built, user-configurable scorers for medical imaging systems (e.g. digitizer chain).<i>Main results</i>. We developed a flexible set of extensions that can be adapted to solve research questions for a variety of imaging modalities. We then utilized these extensions to model specific examples of cone-beam CT (CBCT), positron emission tomography (PET), and prompt gamma (PG) systems. The first of these new geometry components, the FlatImager, was used to model example CBCT and PG systems. Detected signals were accumulated in each detector pixel to obtain the intensity of x-rays penetrating objects or prompt gammas from proton-nuclear interaction. The second of these new geometry components, the RingImager, was used to model an example PET system. Positron-electron annihilation signals were recorded in crystals of the RingImager and coincidences were detected. The simulated data were processed using corresponding post-processing algorithms for each modality and obtained results in good agreement with the expected true signals or experimental measurement.<i>Significance</i>. The newly developed extension is a first step to making it easier for TOPAS users to build and simulate medical imaging systems.

Relative to the rapid progress in single-domain structure prediction, there are few effective tools available for multi-domain protein structure assembly, mainly due to the complexity of modeling multi-domain proteins, which involves higher degrees of freedom in domain-orientation space and various levels of continuous and discontinuous domain assembly and linker refinement. To meet the challenge and the high demand of the community, we developed I-TASSER-MTD to model the structures and functions of multi-domain proteins through a progressive protocol that combines sequence-based domain parsing, single-domain structure folding, inter-domain structure assembly and structure-based function annotation in a fully automated pipeline. Advanced deep-learning models have been incorporated into each of the steps to enhance both the domain modeling and inter-domain assembly accuracy. The protocol allows for the incorporation of experimental cross-linking data and cryo-electron microscopy density maps to guide the multi-domain structure assembly simulations.

Robust validation processes are essential for test reliability, requiring standard samples and databases deriving from real samples and in silico generated artificial controls. We propose a MeStanG as a resource for generating HTS Nanopore data sets to evaluate present and emerging bioinformatics pipelines. MeStanG allows samples to be designed with user-defined organism abundances expressed as number of reads, reference sequences, and predetermined or custom errors by sequencing profiles. The simulator pipeline was evaluated by analyzing its output mock metagenomic samples containing known read abundances using read mapping, genome assembly, and taxonomic classification on three scenarios: a bacterial community composed of nine different organisms, samples resembling pathogen-infected wheat plants, and a viral pathogen serial dilution sampling. The evaluation was able to report consistently the same organisms, and their read abundances as provided in the mock metagenomic sample design. Based on this performance and its novel capacity of generating exact number of reads, MeStanG can be used by scientists to develop mock metagenomic samples (artificial HTS data sets) to assess the diagnostic performance metrics of bioinformatic pipelines, allowing the user to choose predetermined or customized models for research and training.",False,True,,0.7130583,mestang,,16.9946385,ok,,mestang-resource,,v2,0.9946385,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39660955,SG-ML-PLAP: A structure-guided machine learning-based scoring function for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.,"Computational methods to predict binding affinity of protein-ligand complex have been used extensively to design inhibitors for proteins selected as drug targets. In recent years machine learning (ML) is being increasingly used for design of drugs/inhibitors. However, ranking compounds as per their experimental binding affinity has remained a major challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to develop ML-based scoring function (MLSF) for predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. In this work, protein-ligand interaction features, namely, extended connectivity interaction fingerprints (ECIF), derived from the PDBbind dataset have been used to build ML models for binding affinity prediction. The benchmarking has been done on the Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions (CASF) dataset and also by predicting the binding affinity of unseen protein-ligand complexes which have structural features different from those present in the training dataset. Furthermore, an improvement in the performance of MLSF on the redocked CASF complexes generated by AutoDock Vina software was seen when the training set consisting of crystal structures was supplemented with redocked protein-ligand complexes. The MLSF trained on crystal structures alone using a combination of ECIF and VINA features also predicted binding affinities of crystal as well as docked complexes with high accuracy. Overall, the MLSF developed in this work shows improved performance compared to conventional SFs and several other MLSFs. It will be a valuable resource for identifying novel inhibitors by structure-based virtual screening protocols.

Therefore, it benefits researchers to examine models from various model providers and perform comparative analysis to identify what models can best address their specific use cases. To make data from a large array of model providers more easily accessible to the broader scientific community, we established 3D-Beacons, a collaborative initiative to create a federated network with unified data access mechanisms.

We use an independent dataset (269 WWTPs) to show that MiDAS 4, compared to commonly used universal reference databases, provides a better coverage for WWTP bacteria and an improved rate of genus and species level classification. Taking advantage of MiDAS 4, we carry out an amplicon-based, global-scale microbial community profiling of activated sludge plants using two common sets of primers targeting regions of the 16S rRNA gene, revealing how environmental conditions and biogeography shape the activated sludge microbiota. We also identify core and conditionally rare or abundant taxa, encompassing 966 genera and 1530 species that represent approximately 80% and 50% of the accumulated read abundance, respectively.

The iPPM captures multi-scale feature maps, ensuring the extraction of both local and global image contexts. This enhances the feature maps produced by the backbone, regardless of the spatial positioning or size of the tumors. To ensure the model's transparency and accountability, we employ Explainable AI. Specifically, we use Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), which highlights the features or areas focused on while predicting individual images. NeuroNet19 is trained on four classes of BTs: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumors. It is tested on a public dataset containing 7023 images.

39076831,UAVs-FFDB: A high-resolution dataset for advancing forest fire detection and monitoring using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).,"Forest ecosystems face increasing wildfire threats, demanding prompt and precise detection methods to ensure efficient fire control. However, real-time forest fire data accessibility and timeliness require improvement. Our study addresses the challenge through the introduction of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based forest fire database (UAVs-FFDB), characterized by a dual composition. Firstly, it encompasses a collection of 1653 high-resolution RGB raw images meticulously captured utilizing a standard S500 quadcopter frame in conjunction with a RaspiCamV2 camera. Secondly, the database incorporates augmented data, culminating in a total of 15560 images, thereby enhancing the diversity and comprehensiveness of the dataset. These images were captured within a forested area adjacent to Adana Alparslan Türkeş Science and Technology University in Adana, Turkey. Each raw image in the dataset spans dimensions from 353 × 314 to 640 × 480, while augmented data ranges from 398 × 358 to 640 × 480, resulting in a total dataset size of 692 MB for the raw data subset. In contrast, the augmented data subset accounts for a considerably larger size, totaling 6.76 GB. The raw images are obtained during a UAV surveillance mission, with the camera precisely angled a -180-degree to be horizontal to the ground. The images are taken from altitudes alternating between 5 - 15 meters to diversify the field of vision and to build a more inclusive database. During the surveillance operation, the UAV speed is 2 <i>m/s</i> on average. Following this, the dataset underwent meticulous annotation using the advanced annotation platform, Makesense.ai, enabling accurate demarcation of fire boundaries. This resource equips researchers with the necessary data infrastructure to develop innovative methodologies for early fire detection and continuous monitoring, enhancing efforts to protect ecosystems and human lives while promoting sustainable forest management practices.

Furthermore, most existing software packages are not forward-compatible in regards to supporting ever-changing diagnostic rules adopted by the genetics community. Regular updates of genomics databases pose challenges for reproducible and traceable automated genetic diagnostics tools. Lastly, most of the software tools score low on explainability amongst clinicians. We have created a fully open-source variant curation tool, AnFiSA, with the intention to invite and accept contributions from clinicians, researchers, and professional software developers. The design of AnFiSA addresses the aforementioned issues via the following architectural principles: using a multidimensional database management system (DBMS) for genomic data to address reproducibility, curated decision trees adaptable to changing clinical rules, and a crowdsourcing-friendly interface to address difficult-to-diagnose cases.

However, people with ageing disabilities or intellectual disabilities, non-native speakers, and others have difficulties reading and understanding information. For this reason, it is essential to provide text simplification mechanisms when accessing information. Natural Language Processing methods can be applied to simplify textual content and improve understanding. These methods often use machine learning algorithms and models which require resources, such as corpora, to be trained and tested. This article presents the EASIER corpus, a resource that can be used to build lexical simplification methods to process Spanish domain-independent texts. The EASIER corpus is composed of 260 annotated documents with 8,155 words labelled as complex and 5,130 words with at least one proposed context-aware synonym associated. Expert linguists in easy-to-read and plain language guidelines have annotated the corpus based on their experience adapting texts for people with intellectual disabilities. Sixteen annotation guidelines that discriminate between complex and simple words have been defined to help other groups of experts to generate new annotations. Additionally, an inter-annotator agreement test was performed to validate the corpus, obtaining a Fleiss Kappa coefficient of 0.641. Furthermore, a qualitative evaluation was conducted with 45 users (including people with intellectual disabilities, elderly people, and a control audience).

35172714,CROPSR: an automated platform for complex genome-wide CRISPR gRNA design and validation.,"<h4>Background</h4>CRISPR/Cas9 technology has become an important tool to generate targeted, highly specific genome mutations. The technology has great potential for crop improvement, as crop genomes are tailored to optimize specific traits over generations of breeding. Many crops have highly complex and polyploid genomes, particularly those used for bioenergy or bioproducts. The majority of tools currently available for designing and evaluating gRNAs for CRISPR experiments were developed based on mammalian genomes that do not share the characteristics or design criteria for crop genomes.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an open source tool for genome-wide design and evaluation of gRNA sequences for CRISPR experiments, CROPSR. The genome-wide approach provides a significant decrease in the time required to design a CRISPR experiment, including validation through PCR, at the expense of an overhead compute time required once per genome, at the first run. To better cater to the needs of crop geneticists, restrictions imposed by other packages on design and evaluation of gRNA sequences were lifted. A new machine learning model was developed to provide scores while avoiding situations in which the currently available tools sometimes failed to provide guides for repetitive, A/T-rich genomic regions. We show that our gRNA scoring model provides a significant increase in prediction accuracy over existing tools, even in non-crop genomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CROPSR provides the scientific community with new methods and a new workflow for performing CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments. CROPSR reduces the challenges of working in crops, and helps speed gRNA sequence design, evaluation and validation.

Most pharmaceutical sponsors seeking to develop agents to treat rare diseases will initiate data landscaping efforts to identify various data sources that might be informative with respect to disease prevalence, patient selection and identification, disease progression and any data projecting likelihood of patient response to therapy including any genetic data. Such data are often difficult to come by for highly prevalent, mainstream disease populations let alone for the 8000 rare disease that make up the pooled patient population of rare disease patients. The future of rare disease drug development will hopefully rely on increased data sharing and collaboration among the entire rare disease ecosystem. One path to achieving this outcome has been the development of the rare disease cures accelerator, data analytics platform (RDCA-DAP) funded by the US FDA and operationalized by the Critical Path Institute. FDA intentions were clearly focused on improving the quality of rare disease regulatory applications by sponsors seeking to develop treatment options for various rare disease populations.

37939200,MIGGRI: A multi-instance graph neural network model for inferring gene regulatory networks for Drosophila from spatial expression images.,"Recent breakthrough in spatial transcriptomics has brought great opportunities for exploring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from a brand-new perspective. Especially, the local expression patterns and spatio-temporal regulation mechanisms captured by spatial expression images allow more delicate delineation of the interplay between transcript factors and their target genes. However, the complexity and size of spatial image collections pose significant challenges to GRN inference using image-based methods. Extracting regulatory information from expression images is difficult due to the lack of supervision and the multi-instance nature of the problem, where a gene often corresponds to multiple images captured from different views. While graph models, particularly graph neural networks, have emerged as a promising method for leveraging underlying structure information from known GRNs, incorporating expression images into graphs is not straightforward. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage approach, MIGGRI, for capturing comprehensive regulatory patterns from image collections for each gene and known interactions. Our approach involves a multi-instance graph neural network (GNN) model for GRN inference, which first extracts gene regulatory features from spatial expression images via contrastive learning, and then feeds them to a multi-instance GNN for semi-supervised learning. We apply our approach to a large set of Drosophila embryonic spatial gene expression images. MIGGRI achieves outstanding performance in the inference of GRNs for early eye development and mesoderm development of Drosophila, and shows robustness in the scenarios of missing image information. Additionally, we perform interpretable analysis on image reconstruction and functional subgraphs that may reveal potential pathways or coordinate regulations. By leveraging the power of graph neural networks and the information contained in spatial expression images, our approach has the potential to advance our understanding of gene regulation in complex biological systems.",False,True,,0.711324,,miggri,16.98622704,ok,,,,v2,0.98622704,MIGGRI,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1
35484563,BMC Caller: a webtool to identify and analyze bacterial microcompartment types in sequence data.,"Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are protein-based organelles found across the bacterial tree of life. They consist of a shell, made of proteins that oligomerize into hexagonally and pentagonally shaped building blocks, that surrounds enzymes constituting a segment of a metabolic pathway. The proteins of the shell are unique to BMCs. They also provide selective permeability; this selectivity is dictated by the requirements of their cargo enzymes. We have recently surveyed the wealth of different BMC types and their occurrence in all available genome sequence data by analyzing and categorizing their components found in chromosomal loci using HMM (Hidden Markov Model) protein profiles. To make this a ""do-it yourself"" analysis for the public we have devised a webserver, BMC Caller ( https://bmc-caller.prl.msu.edu ), that compares user input sequences to our HMM profiles, creates a BMC locus visualization, and defines the functional type of BMC, if known. Shell proteins in the input sequence data are also classified according to our function-agnostic naming system and there are links to similar proteins in our database as well as an external link to a structure prediction website to easily generate structural models of the shell proteins, which facilitates understanding permeability properties of the shell. Additionally, the BMC Caller website contains a wealth of information on previously analyzed BMC loci with links to detailed data for each BMC protein and phylogenetic information on the BMC shell proteins.

We construct a comprehensive mouse microbiota genome (CMMG) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published reference and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 41'798 genomes cluster into 1'573 species, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, seven new families, and one new order. CMMG enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 86%, increases the mapping rate over four-fold, and allows functional microbiota analyses of human and mouse linking them to the driver species. Comparing CMMG to microbiota from the unified human gastrointestinal genomes shows an overlap of 62% at the genus but only 10% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct.

37925500,MCF2Chem: A manually curated knowledge base of biosynthetic compound production.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microbes have been used as cell factories to synthesize various chemical compounds. Recent advances in synthetic biological technologies have accelerated the increase in the number and capacity of microbial cell factories; the variety and number of synthetic compounds produced via these cell factories have also grown substantially. However, no database is available that provides detailed information on the microbial cell factories and the synthesized compounds.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we established MCF2Chem, a manually curated knowledge base on the production of biosynthetic compounds using microbial cell factories. It contains 8888 items of production records related to 1231 compounds that were synthesizable by 590 microbial cell factories, including the production data of compounds (titer, yield, productivity, and content), strain culture information (culture medium, carbon source/precursor/substrate), fermentation information (mode, vessel, scale, and condition), and other information (e.g., strain modification method). The database contains statistical analyses data of compounds and microbial species. The data statistics of MCF2Chem showed that bacteria accounted for 60% of the species and that ""fatty acids"", ""terpenoids"", and ""shikimates and phenylpropanoids"" accounted for the top three chemical products. Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Corynebacterium glutamicum synthesized 78% of these chemical compounds. Furthermore, we constructed a system to recommend microbial cell factories suitable for synthesizing target compounds and vice versa by combining MCF2Chem data, additional strain- and compound-related data, the phylogenetic relationships between strains, and compound similarities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MCF2Chem provides a user-friendly interface for querying, browsing, and visualizing detailed statistical information on microbial cell factories and their synthesizable compounds.

39372719,PotatoG-DKB: a potato gene-disease knowledge base mined from biological literature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Potato is the fourth largest food crop in the world, but potato cultivation faces serious threats from various diseases and pests. Despite significant advancements in research on potato disease resistance, these findings are scattered across numerous publications. For researchers, obtaining relevant knowledge by reading and organizing a large body of literature is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Therefore, systematically extracting and organizing the relationships between potato genes and diseases from the literature to establish a potato gene-disease knowledge base is particularly important. Unfortunately, there is currently no such gene-disease knowledge base available.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we constructed a Potato Gene-Disease Knowledge Base (PotatoG-DKB) using natural language processing techniques and large language models. We used PubMed as the data source and obtained 2,906 article abstracts related to potato biology, extracted entities and relationships between potato genes and related disease, and stored them in a Neo4j database.

38869148,LRTK: a platform agnostic toolkit for linked-read analysis of both human genome and metagenome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Linked-read sequencing technologies generate high-base quality short reads that contain extrapolative information on long-range DNA connectedness. These advantages of linked-read technologies are well known and have been demonstrated in many human genomic and metagenomic studies. However, existing linked-read analysis pipelines (e.g., Long Ranger) were primarily developed to process sequencing data from the human genome and are not suited for analyzing metagenomic sequencing data. Moreover, linked-read analysis pipelines are typically limited to 1 specific sequencing platform.<h4>Findings</h4>To address these limitations, we present the Linked-Read ToolKit (LRTK), a unified and versatile toolkit for platform agnostic processing of linked-read sequencing data from both human genome and metagenome. LRTK provides functions to perform linked-read simulation, barcode sequencing error correction, barcode-aware read alignment and metagenome assembly, reconstruction of long DNA fragments, taxonomic classification and quantification, and barcode-assisted genomic variant calling and phasing. LRTK has the ability to process multiple samples automatically and provides users with the option to generate reproducible reports during processing of raw sequencing data and at multiple checkpoints throughout downstream analysis. We applied LRTK on linked reads from simulation, mock community, and real datasets for both human genome and metagenome. We showcased LRTK's ability to generate comparative performance results from preceding benchmark studies and to report these results in publication-ready HTML document plots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LRTK provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.",False,True,,0.7227246,,rtk,16.978796799999998,ok,,linked-read toolkit,lrtk,v2,0.9787968,LRTK,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In recent decades, a large number of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have been funded and undertaken, but their small sample sizes and heterogeneous methods have led to inconsistencies across findings. To tackle this, efforts have been made to combine datasets across studies and sites. While notable recent multicentre initiatives and the resulting meta- and mega-analytical outputs have progressed the field, efforts have generally been restricted to MRI scans in one or two illness stages, often overlook patient heterogeneity, and study populations have rarely been globally representative of the diversity of patients who experience psychosis. Furthermore, access to these datasets is often restricted to consortia members who can contribute data, likely from research institutions located in high-income countries. The Psychosis MRI Shared Data Resource (Psy-ShareD) is a new open access structural MRI data sharing partnership that will host pre-existing structural T1-weighted MRI data collected across multiple sites worldwide, including the Global South.

A limited number of reference sequences are available; a substantial fraction of phylogenetic diversity is not fully characterized; widely used databases do not reflect current archaeal taxonomy and contain mislabelled sequences. We address these gaps with a systematic and tractable approach based around the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) combined with the eukaryote PR2 and MIDORI mitochondrial databases. After removing incongruent, chimeric and duplicate SSU sequences, this combination (<i>GTDB+</i>) provides a small improvement in annotation of a set of estuarine Archaea Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) compared to SILVA. We add to this a collection of near full length rRNA sequences and the prokaryote SSU sequences in SILVA, creating a new reference database, KSGP ( <b><i>K</i></b> arst, <b><i>S</i></b> ilva, <b><i>G</i></b> TDB, and <b>P</b>R2). The additional sequences are (re-)annotated using three different approaches. The most conservative, using lowest common ancestor, gives a further small improvement.

During a foodborne outbreak investigation, microbiological analysis of food vehicles detects responsible pathogens and traces contamination sources. Metagenomic approaches offer a comprehensive view of the genomic composition of microbial communities, facilitating the detection of potential pathogens in samples. Combined with sequencing techniques like Oxford Nanopore sequencing, such metagenomic approaches become faster and easier to apply. A key limitation of these approaches is the lack of accessible, easy-to-use, and openly available pipelines for pathogen identification and tracking from (meta)genomic data.<h4>Findings</h4>PathoGFAIR is a collection of Galaxy-based Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) workflows employing state-of-the-art tools to detect and track pathogens from metagenomic Nanopore sequencing. Although initially developed to detect pathogens in food datasets, the workflows can be applied to other metagenomic Nanopore pathogenic data.

39522045,MIMt: a curated 16S rRNA reference database with less redundancy and higher accuracy at species-level identification.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Accurate determination and quantification of the taxonomic composition of microbial communities, especially at the species level, is one of the major issues in metagenomics. This is primarily due to the limitations of commonly used 16S rRNA reference databases, which either contain a lot of redundancy or a high percentage of sequences with missing taxonomic information. This may lead to erroneous identifications and, thus, to inaccurate conclusions regarding the ecological role and importance of those microorganisms in the ecosystem.<h4>Results</h4>The current study presents MIMt, a new 16S rRNA database for archaea and bacteria's identification, encompassing 47 001 sequences, all precisely identified at species level. In addition, a MIMt2.0 version was created with only curated sequences from RefSeq Targeted loci with 32 086 sequences. MIMt aims to be updated twice a year to include all newly sequenced species. We evaluated MIMt against Greengenes, RDP, GTDB and SILVA in terms of sequence distribution and taxonomic assignments accuracy. Our results showed that MIMt contains less redundancy, and despite being 20 to 500 times smaller than existing databases, outperforms them in completeness and taxonomic accuracy, enabling more precise assignments at lower taxonomic ranks and thus, significantly improving species-level identification.",False,True,,0.6326327,,mimt,16.9724677,ok,,,refseq | rdp | gtdb | silva | mimt2,v2,0.9724677,MIMt,True,5.0,True,True,,,False,,1

35715874,ChemChaste: Simulating spatially inhomogeneous biochemical reaction-diffusion systems for modeling cell-environment feedbacks.,"<h4>Background</h4>Spatial organization plays an important role in the function of many biological systems, from cell fate specification in animal development to multistep metabolic conversions in microbial communities. The study of such systems benefits from the use of spatially explicit computational models that combine a discrete description of cells with a continuum description of one or more chemicals diffusing within a surrounding bulk medium. These models allow the in silico testing and refinement of mechanistic hypotheses. However, most existing models of this type do not account for concurrent bulk and intracellular biochemical reactions and their possible coupling.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Here, we describe ChemChaste, an extension for the open-source C++ computational biology library Chaste. ChemChaste enables the spatial simulation of both multicellular and bulk biochemistry by expanding on Chaste's existing capabilities. In particular, ChemChaste enables (i) simulation of an arbitrary number of spatially diffusing chemicals, (ii) spatially heterogeneous chemical diffusion coefficients, and (iii) inclusion of both bulk and intracellular biochemical reactions and their coupling. ChemChaste also introduces a file-based interface that allows users to define the parameters relating to these functional features without the need to interact directly with Chaste's core C++ code.

36598505,Learning to automate cryo-electron microscopy data collection with Ptolemy.,"Over the past decade, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has emerged as an important method for determining near-native, near-atomic resolution 3D structures of biological macromolecules. To meet the increasing demand for cryoEM, automated methods that improve throughput and efficiency of microscope operation are needed. Currently, the targeting algorithms provided by most data-collection software require time-consuming manual tuning of parameters for each grid, and, in some cases, operators must select targets completely manually. However, the development of fully automated targeting algorithms is non-trivial, because images often have low signal-to-noise ratios and optimal targeting strategies depend on a range of experimental parameters and macromolecule behaviors that vary between projects and collection sessions. To address this, Ptolemy provides a pipeline to automate low- and medium-magnification targeting using a suite of purpose-built computer vision and machine-learning algorithms, including mixture models, convolutional neural networks and U-Nets. Learned models in this pipeline are trained on a large set of images from real-world cryoEM data-collection sessions, labeled with locations selected by human operators. These models accurately detect and classify regions of interest in low- and medium-magnification images, and generalize to unseen sessions, as well as to images collected on different microscopes at another facility.

A key topic discussed was the frequent variability in results obtained between different microbial WGS-related AMR gene prediction workflows. Further, comparative benchmarking studies are difficult to perform due to differences in AMR gene prediction accuracy and a lack of agreement in the naming of AMR genes (semantic conformity) for the results obtained. To illustrate this problem, and as a capacity-building exercise to encourage stakeholder involvement, a comparative Galaxy-based BenchAMRking platform was developed and validated using datasets from bacterial species with PCR-verified AMR gene presence or absence information from abritAMR.<h4>Results</h4>The Galaxy-based BenchAMRking platform ( https://erasmusmc-bioinformatics.github.io/benchAMRking/ ) specifically focusses on the steps involved in identifying AMR genes from raw reads and sequence assemblies.

This paper focuses on the critical problem of identifying breast cancer using a model called Attention U-Net. The model is utilized on the Breast Ultrasound Image Dataset (BUSI), comprising 780 breast images. The images are categorized into three distinct groups: 437 cases classified as benign, 210 cases classified as malignant, and 133 cases classified as normal. The proposed model leverages the attention-driven U-Net's encoder blocks to capture hierarchical features effectively. The model comprises four decoder blocks which is a pivotal component in the U-Net architecture, responsible for expanding the encoded feature representation obtained from the encoder block and for reconstructing spatial information. Four attention gates are incorporated strategically to enhance feature localization during decoding, showcasing a sophisticated design that facilitates accurate segmentation of breast tumors in ultrasound images. It displays its efficacy in accurately delineating and segregating tumor borders. The experimental findings demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and a dice score of 0.92.

40279264,Gencube: centralized retrieval and integration of multi-omics resources from leading databases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The volume of multi-omics data for diverse species is growing at an unprecedented rate, with new genome assemblies, related annotations, and high-throughput sequencing resources being submitted daily to various genomic data repositories. In response to this data influx, both existing and new databases are establishing optimized hierarchical structures to manage the vast amount of information.

37285215,MCR toolkit: A GPU-based toolkit for multi-channel reconstruction of preclinical and clinical x-ray CT data.,"<h4>Background</h4>The advancement of x-ray CT into the domains of photon counting spectral imaging and dynamic cardiac and perfusion imaging has created many new challenges and opportunities for clinicians and researchers. To address challenges such as dose constraints and scanning times while capitalizing on opportunities such as multi-contrast imaging and low-dose coronary angiography, these multi-channel imaging applications require a new generation of CT reconstruction tools. These new tools should exploit the relationships between imaging channels during reconstruction to set new image quality standards while serving as a platform for direct translation between the preclinical and clinical domains.<h4>Purpose</h4>We outline and demonstrate a new Multi-Channel Reconstruction (MCR) Toolkit for GPU-based analytical and iterative reconstruction of preclinical and clinical multi-energy and dynamic x-ray CT data. To promote open science, open-source distribution of the Toolkit will coincide with the release of this publication (GPL v3; gitlab.oit.duke.edu/dpc18/mcr-toolkit-public).<h4>Methods</h4>The MCR Toolkit source code is implemented in C/C++ and NVIDIA's CUDA GPU programming interface, with scripting support from MATLAB and Python. The Toolkit implements matched, separable footprint CT reconstruction operators for projection and backprojection in two geometries: planar, cone-beam CT (CBCT) and 3rd generation, cylindrical multi-detector row CT (MDCT). Analytical reconstruction is performed using filtered backprojection (FBP) for circular CBCT, weighted FBP (WFBP) for helical CBCT, and cone-parallel projection rebinning followed by WFBP for MDCT. Arbitrary combinations of energy and temporal channels are iteratively reconstructed under a generalized multi-channel signal model for joint reconstruction. We solve this generalized model algebraically using the split Bregman optimization method and the BiCGSTAB(l) linear solver interchangeably for both CBCT and MDCT data. Rank-sparse kernel regression (RSKR) and patch-based singular value thresholding (pSVT) are used to regularize the energy and time dimensions, respectively. Under a Gaussian noise model, regularization parameters are estimated automatically from the input data, dramatically reducing algorithm complexity for end users. Multi-GPU parallelization of the reconstruction operators is supported to manage reconstruction times.<h4>Results</h4>Denoising with RSKR and pSVT and post-reconstruction material decomposition are illustrated with preclinical and clinical cardiac photon-counting (PC)CT data. A digital MOBY mouse phantom with cardiac motion is used to illustrate single energy (SE), multi-energy (ME), time resolved (TR), and combined multi-energy and time-resolved (METR) helical, CBCT reconstruction. A fixed set of projection data is used across all reconstruction cases to demonstrate the Toolkit's robustness to increasing data dimensionality. Identical reconstruction code is applied to in vivo cardiac PCCT data acquired in a mouse model of atherosclerosis (METR). Clinical cardiac CT reconstruction is illustrated using the XCAT phantom and the DukeSim CT simulator, while dual-source, dual-energy CT reconstruction is illustrated for data acquired with a Siemens Flash scanner. Benchmarking results with NVIDIA RTX 8000 GPU hardware demonstrate 61%-99% efficiency in scaling computation from one to four GPUs for these reconstruction problems.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The MCR Toolkit provides a robust solution for temporal and spectral x-ray CT reconstruction problems and was built from the ground up to facilitate translation of CT research and development between preclinical and clinical applications.",False,True,,0.6854024,,mcr,16.9503256,ok,,hannel reconstruction,cuda | cbct | mdct | pcct | gpu | cr | gpl,v2,0.9503256,MCR toolkit,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
35668316,Innovations in Therapy Development for Rare Diseases Through the Rare Disease Cures Accelerator-Data and Analytics Platform.,"Rare diseases impact the lives of an estimated 350 million people worldwide, and yet about 90% of rare diseases remain without an approved treatment. New technologies have become available, such as gene and oligonucleotide therapies, that offer great promise in treating rare diseases. However, progress toward the development of therapies to treat these diseases is hampered by a limited understanding of the course of each rare disease, how changes in disease progression occur and can be effectively measured over time, and challenges in designing and running clinical trials in diseases where the natural history is poorly characterized. Data that could be used to characterize the natural history of each disease has often been collected in various ways, including in electronic health records, patient-report registries, clinical natural history studies, and in past clinical trials. However, each data source contains a limited number of subjects and different data elements, and data is frequently kept proprietary in the hands of the study sponsor rather than shared widely across the rare disease community. The Rare Disease Cures Accelerator-Data and Analytics Platform (RDCA-DAP) is an FDA-funded effort to overcome these persistent challenges. By aggregating data across all rare diseases and making that data available to the community to support understanding of rare disease natural history and inform drug development, RDCA-DAP aims to accelerate the regulatory approval of new therapies. RDCA-DAP curates, standardizes, and tags data across rare disease datasets to make it findable within the database, and contains a built-in analytics platform to help visualize, interpret, and use it to support drug development. RDCA-DAP will coordinate data and tool resources across non-profit, commercial, and for-profit entities to serve a diverse array of rare disease stakeholders that includes academic researchers, drug developers, FDA reviewers and of course patients and their caregivers.

Sapflow measurements provide a direct measure of water movement through plant stems, but, to our knowledge, sapflow has never been used to study density dependence and competition at large (regional or global) scales. Here, we examine a global database of sapflow measurements, the SapFluxNet database, for signs of density-dependent competition for water. We find that plant-level water uptake decreases with increasing competition from neighbours (specifically, neighbourhood basal area). Further analysis demonstrates that global-scale variability in annual sapflow can be largely explained (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.522) by the combination of average vapour pressure and neighbourhood summed basal area.

We build an oil & gas accident graph based on more than a thousand severe accidents for the period 1970-2016 recorded for refineries, tankers, and gas networks in the authoritative ENergy-related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD). We explore the distribution of potential chains-of-events leading to severe accidents by combining graph theory, Markov analysis and catastrophe dynamics.

Second, we quantify the space of possible chains-of-events using the concept of fundamental matrix and rank them by defining a likelihood-based importance measure γ.

39460934,Discovering genotype-phenotype relationships with machine learning and the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD).,"<h4>Background</h4>Predicting phenotypes from genetic variation is foundational for fields as diverse as bioengineering and global change biology, highlighting the importance of efficient methods to predict gene functions. Linking genetic changes to phenotypic changes has been a goal of decades of experimental work, especially for some model gene families, including light-sensitive opsin proteins. Opsins can be expressed in vitro to measure light absorption parameters, including λmax-the wavelength of maximum absorbance-which strongly affects organismal phenotypes like color vision. Despite extensive research on opsins, the data remain dispersed, uncompiled, and often challenging to access, thereby precluding systematic and comprehensive analyses of the intricate relationships between genotype and phenotype.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we report a newly compiled database of all heterologously expressed opsin genes with λmax phenotypes that we call the Visual Physiology Opsin Database (VPOD). VPOD_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin genotypes and corresponding λmax phenotypes collected across all animals from 73 separate publications. We use VPOD data and deepBreaks to show regression-based machine learning (ML) models often reliably predict λmax, account for nonadditive effects of mutations on function, and identify functionally critical amino acid sites.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ability to reliably predict functions from gene sequences alone using ML will allow robust exploration of molecular-evolutionary patterns governing phenotype, will inform functional and evolutionary connections to an organism's ecological niche, and may be used more broadly for de novo protein design.

However, our knowledge of phage genomics is sparse, and the use of existing bioinformatic pipelines and tools requires considerable bioinformatic expertise. These challenges have substantially limited the clinical translation of phage therapy.<h4>Findings</h4>We have developed PhageGE (Phage Genome Explorer), a user-friendly graphical interface application for the interactive analysis of phage genomes. PhageGE enables users to perform key analyses, including phylogenetic analysis, visualization of phylogenetic trees, prediction of phage life cycle, and comparative analysis of phage genome annotations. The new R Shiny web server, PhageGE, integrates existing R packages and combines them with several newly developed functions to facilitate these analyses. Additionally, the web server provides interactive visualization capabilities and allows users to directly export publication-quality images.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PhageGE is a valuable tool that simplifies the analysis of phage genome data and may expedite the development and clinical translation of phage therapy.

37749380,"A metagenomic catalog for exploring the plastizymes landscape covering taxa, genes, and proteins.","There are significant environmental and health concerns associated with the current inefficient plastic recycling process. This study presents the first integrated reference catalog of plastic-contaminated environments obtained using an insilico workflow that could play a significant role in discovering new plastizymes. Here, we combined 66 whole metagenomic data from plastic-contaminated environment samples from four previously collected metagenome data with our new sample. In this study, an integrated plastic-contaminated environment gene, protein, taxa, and plastic degrading enzyme catalog (PDEC) was constructed. These catalogs contain 53,300,583 non-redundant genes and proteins, 691 metagenome-assembled genomes, and 136,654 plastizymes. Based on KEGG and eggNOG annotations, 42% of recognized genes lack annotations, indicating their functions remain elusive and warrant further investigation. Additionally, the PDEC catalog highlights hydrolases, peroxidases, and cutinases as the prevailing plastizymes. Ultimately, following multiple validation procedures, our effort focused on pinpointing enzymes that exhibited the highest similarity to the introduced plastizymes in terms of both sequence and three-dimensional structural aspects. This encompassed evaluating the linear composition of constituent units as well as the complex spatial conformation of the molecule.

39693482,An Automatic and End-to-End System for Rare Disease Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Ontology-Enhanced Large Language Models: Development Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Rare diseases affect millions worldwide but sometimes face limited research focus individually due to low prevalence. Many rare diseases do not have specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) and Tenth Edition (ICD-10), codes and therefore cannot be reliably extracted from granular fields like ""Diagnosis"" and ""Problem List"" entries, which complicates tasks that require identification of patients with these conditions, including clinical trial recruitment and research efforts. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering the potential to improve medical research, diagnosis, and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning specific rare diseases, and cannot effectively manage rare disease data in its various ontological forms, making it unsuitable for these tasks.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim is to create an end-to-end system called automated rare disease mining (AutoRD), which automates the extraction of rare disease-related information from medical text, focusing on entities and their relations to other medical concepts, such as signs and symptoms. AutoRD integrates up-to-date ontologies with other structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conducted various experiments to evaluate AutoRD's performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods.<h4>Methods</h4>AutoRD is a pipeline system that involves data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implemented this system using GPT-4 and medical knowledge graphs developed from the open-source Human Phenotype and Orphanet ontologies, using techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt engineering. We quantitatively evaluated our system's performance in entity extraction, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction. The experiment used the well-curated dataset RareDis2023, which contains medical literature focused on rare disease entities and their relations, making it an ideal dataset for training and testing our methodology.<h4>Results</h4>On the RareDis2023 dataset, AutoRD achieved an overall entity extraction F1-score of 56.1% and a relation extraction F1-score of 38.6%, marking a 14.4% improvement over the baseline LLM. Notably, the F1-score for rare disease entity extraction reached 83.5%, indicating high precision and recall in identifying rare disease mentions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating LLMs with medical ontologies in extracting complex rare disease information.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs, addressing critical limitations of existing LLMs by improving identification of these diseases and connecting them to related clinical features. This work underscores the significant potential of LLMs in transforming health care, particularly in the rare disease domain. By leveraging ontology-enhanced LLMs, AutoRD constructs a robust medical knowledge base that incorporates up-to-date rare disease information, facilitating improved identification of patients and resulting in more inclusive research and trial candidacy efforts.",False,True,,0.7066927,,a,16.9374065,ok,,raredis2023 | rare disease mining,autord | utord,v2,0.9374065,Automatic and End-to-End System for Rare Disease Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Ontology-Enhanced Large Language Models,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

While PGx testing is becoming more common in clinical practice and may be reimbursed by Medicare/Medicaid and commercial insurance, interpreting PGx testing results for clinical decision support is still a challenge. The Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool (PharmCAT) has been designed to tackle the need for transparent, automatic interpretations of patient genetic data. PharmCAT incorporates a patient's genotypes, annotates PGx information (allele, genotype, and phenotype), and generates a report with PGx guideline recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and/or the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). PharmCAT has introduced new features in the last 2 years, including a variant call format (VCF) Preprocessor, the inclusion of DPWG guidelines, and functionalities for PGx research. For example, researchers can use the VCF Preprocessor to prepare biobank-scale data for PharmCAT. In addition, PharmCAT enables the assessment of novel partial and combination alleles that are composed of known PGx variants and can call CYP2D6 genotypes based on single and deletions in the input VCF file.

Many other chemical databases and services utilize these data, and previous projects have focused on methods to index, search, and extract it for review and use. We present a comprehensive effort that combines bulk automated data extraction over tens of thousands of pages, semiautomated data extraction over hundreds of pages, and fine-grained manual extraction of individual lists and compounds of interest. We then correlate these data with the existing contents of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database. This was performed with a number of intentions including ensuring as complete a mapping as possible between the Dashboard and Wikipedia so that relevant snippets of the article are loaded for the user to review. Conflicts between Dashboard content and Wikipedia in terms of, for example, identifiers such as chemical registry numbers, names, and InChIs and structure-based collisions such as SMILES were identified and used as the basis of curation of both DSSTox and Wikipedia. This work also allowed us to evaluate available data for sets of chemicals of interest to the Agency, such as synthetic cannabinoids, and expand the content in DSSTox as appropriate. This work also led to improved bidirectional linkage of the detailed chemistry and usage information from Wikipedia with expert-curated structure and identifier data from DSSTox for a new list of nearly 20,000 chemicals.

36752340,DRAGON-Data: a platform and protocol for integrating genomic and phenotypic data across large psychiatric cohorts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current psychiatric diagnoses, although heritable, have not been clearly mapped onto distinct underlying pathogenic processes. The same symptoms often occur in multiple disorders, and a substantial proportion of both genetic and environmental risk factors are shared across disorders. However, the relationship between shared symptoms and shared genetic liability is still poorly understood.<h4>Aims</h4>Well-characterised, cross-disorder samples are needed to investigate this matter, but few currently exist. Our aim is to develop procedures to purposely curate and aggregate genotypic and phenotypic data in psychiatric research.<h4>Method</h4>As part of the Cardiff MRC Mental Health Data Pathfinder initiative, we have curated and harmonised phenotypic and genetic information from 15 studies to create a new data repository, DRAGON-Data. To date, DRAGON-Data includes over 45 000 individuals: adults and children with neurodevelopmental or psychiatric diagnoses, affected probands within collected families and individuals who carry a known neurodevelopmental risk copy number variant.<h4>Results</h4>We have processed the available phenotype information to derive core variables that can be reliably analysed across groups. In addition, all data-sets with genotype information have undergone rigorous quality control, imputation, copy number variant calling and polygenic score generation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DRAGON-Data combines genetic and non-genetic information, and is available as a resource for research across traditional psychiatric diagnostic categories.

39949805,TPMGD: A genomic database for the traditional medicines in Pakistan.,"<h4>Objective</h4>In Pakistan, traditional medicines are an important component of the medical system, with numerous varieties and great demands. However, due to the scattered resources and the lack of systematic collection and collation, adulteration of traditional Pakistani medicine (TPM) is common, which severely affects the safety of their medicinal use and the import and export trades. Therefore, it is urgent to systematically organize and unify the management of TPM and establish a set of standards and operable methods for the identification of TPM.<h4>Methods</h4>We collected and organized the information on 128 TPMs with regard to their medicinal parts, efficacy, usage, and genetic material, based on Pakistan <i>Hamdard Pharmacopoeia of Eastern Medicine: Pharmaceutical Codex</i>. The genetic information of TPM is summarized from national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) and global pharmacopoeia genome database (GPGD). Furthermore, we utilized bioinformatics technology to supplement the chloroplast genome (cp-genome) data of 12 TPMs. To build the web server, we used the Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP (LAMP) system and constructed the webpage on a PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) model view controller (MVC) framework.<h4>Results</h4>We constructed a new genomic database, the traditional Pakistani medicine genomic database (TPMGD). This database comprises five entries, namely homepage, medicinal species, species identification, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), and download. Currently, TPMGD contains basic profiles of 128 TPMs and genetic information of 102 TPMs, including 140 cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences and 119 mitochondrial genome sequences from <i>Bombyx mori</i>, 1 396 internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences and 1 074 intergenic region (<i>psb</i>A<i>-trn</i>H) sequences specific to 92 and 83 plant species, respectively. Additionally, TPMGD includes 199 cp-genome sequences of 82 TPMs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>TPMGD is a multifunctional database that integrates species description, functional information inquiry, genetic information storage, molecular identification of TPM, etc. The database not only provides convenience for TPM information queries but also establishes the scientific basis for the medication safety, species identification, and resource protection of TPM.",False,True,,0.7045378,,pmgd,16.9330169,ok,tpmgd | traditional pakistani medicine genomic database,hamdard pharmacopoeia of eastern medicine | traditional pakistani medicine genomic database,tpmgd | tpm | gpgd | lamp | its2,v2,0.9330169,TPMGD,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

37036103,The GEN-ERA toolbox: unified and reproducible workflows for research in microbial genomics.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microbial culture collections play a key role in taxonomy by studying the diversity of their strains and providing well-characterized biological material to the scientific community for fundamental and applied research. These microbial resource centers thus need to implement new standards in species delineation, including whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomics. In this context, the genomic needs of the Belgian Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms were studied, resulting in the GEN-ERA toolbox. The latter is a unified cluster of bioinformatic workflows dedicated to both bacteria and small eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts).<h4>Findings</h4>This public toolbox allows researchers without a specific training in bioinformatics to perform robust phylogenomic analyses. Hence, it facilitates all steps from genome downloading and quality assessment, including genomic contamination estimation, to tree reconstruction. It also offers workflows for average nucleotide identity comparisons and metabolic modeling.<h4>Technical details</h4>Nextflow workflows are launched by a single command and are available on the GEN-ERA GitHub repository (https://github.com/Lcornet/GENERA). All the workflows are based on Singularity containers to increase reproducibility.<h4>Testing</h4>The toolbox was developed for a diversity of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. It was further tested on an empirical dataset of 18 (meta)genomes of early branching Cyanobacteria, providing the most up-to-date phylogenomic analysis of the Gloeobacterales order, the first group to diverge in the evolutionary tree of Cyanobacteria.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The GEN-ERA toolbox can be used to infer completely reproducible comparative genomic and metabolic analyses on prokaryotes and small eukaryotes.

A large subset of these lesions tends to be high grade tumors which portend poor prognoses and low survival rates, and are estimated to be the tenth leading cause of death worldwide. The complex nature of the brain tissue environment in which these lesions arise offers a rich opportunity for translational research. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide a comprehensive view of the abnormal regions in the brain, therefore, its applications in the translational brain cancer research is considered essential for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Recent years has seen rapid growth in the field of radiogenomics, especially in cancer, and scientists have been able to successfully integrate the quantitative data extracted from medical images (also known as radiomics) with genomics to answer new and clinically relevant questions. In this paper, we took raw MRI scans from the REMBRANDT data collection from public domain, and performed volumetric segmentation to identify subregions of the brain. Radiomic features were then extracted to represent the MRIs in a quantitative yet summarized format.

Since its last update in 2018, we have been actively enhancing the quantity and quality of the drug data in this knowledgebase. In this latest release (DrugBank 6.0), the number of FDA approved drugs has grown from 2646 to 4563 (a 72% increase), the number of investigational drugs has grown from 3394 to 6231 (a 38% increase), the number of drug-drug interactions increased from 365 984 to 1 413 413 (a 300% increase), and the number of drug-food interactions expanded from 1195 to 2475 (a 200% increase). In addition to this notable expansion in database size, we have added thousands of new, colorful, richly annotated pathways depicting drug mechanisms and drug metabolism. Likewise, existing datasets have been significantly improved and expanded, by adding more information on drug indications, drug-drug interactions, drug-food interactions and many other relevant data types for 11 891 drugs.

37342968,"Expanding the stdpopsim species catalog, and lessons learned for realistic genome simulations.","Simulation is a key tool in population genetics for both methods development and empirical research, but producing simulations that recapitulate the main features of genomic datasets remains a major obstacle. Today, more realistic simulations are possible thanks to large increases in the quantity and quality of available genetic data, and the sophistication of inference and simulation software. However, implementing these simulations still requires substantial time and specialized knowledge. These challenges are especially pronounced for simulating genomes for species that are not well-studied, since it is not always clear what information is required to produce simulations with a level of realism sufficient to confidently answer a given question. The community-developed framework stdpopsim seeks to lower this barrier by facilitating the simulation of complex population genetic models using up-to-date information. The initial version of stdpopsim focused on establishing this framework using six well-characterized model species (Adrion et al., 2020). Here, we report on major improvements made in the new release of stdpopsim (version 0.2), which includes a significant expansion of the species catalog and substantial additions to simulation capabilities. Features added to improve the realism of the simulated genomes include non-crossover recombination and provision of species-specific genomic annotations. Through community-driven efforts, we expanded the number of species in the catalog more than threefold and broadened coverage across the tree of life. During the process of expanding the catalog, we have identified common sticking points and developed the best practices for setting up genome-scale simulations. We describe the input data required for generating a realistic simulation, suggest good practices for obtaining the relevant information from the literature, and discuss common pitfalls and major considerations. These improvements to stdpopsim aim to further promote the use of realistic whole-genome population genetic simulations, especially in non-model organisms, making them available, transparent, and accessible to everyone.",False,True,,0.718877,stdpopsim,,16.92540896,ok,,,,v2,0.92540896,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Given the complex dynamics of HDV infection and the urgent need for advanced research tools, this article introduces vHDvDB 2.0, a comprehensive HDV full-length sequence database. This innovative platform integrates data preprocessing, secondary structure prediction, and epidemiological research tools. The primary goal of vHDvDB 2.0 is to consolidate HDV sequence data into a user-friendly repository, thereby facilitating access for researchers and enhancing the broader scientific understanding of HDV.

39487448,The Amphibian Genomics Consortium: advancing genomic and genetic resources for amphibian research and conservation.,"Amphibians represent a diverse group of tetrapods, marked by deep divergence times between their three systematic orders and families. Studying amphibian biology through the genomics lens increases our understanding of the features of this animal class and that of other terrestrial vertebrates. The need for amphibian genomic resources is more urgent than ever due to the increasing threats to this group. Amphibians are one of the most imperiled taxonomic groups, with approximately 41% of species threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, changes in land use patterns, disease, climate change, and their synergistic effects. Amphibian genomic resources have provided a better understanding of ontogenetic diversity, tissue regeneration, diverse life history and reproductive modes, anti-predator strategies, and resilience and adaptive responses. They also serve as essential models for studying broad genomic traits, such as evolutionary genome expansions and contractions, as they exhibit the widest range of genome sizes among all animal taxa and possess multiple mechanisms of genetic sex determination. Despite these features, genome sequencing of amphibians has significantly lagged behind that of other vertebrates, primarily due to the challenges of assembling their large, repeat-rich genomes and the relative lack of societal support. The emergence of long-read sequencing technologies, combined with advanced molecular and computational techniques that improve scaffolding and reduce computational workloads, is now making it possible to address some of these challenges. To promote and accelerate the production and use of amphibian genomics research through international coordination and collaboration, we launched the Amphibian Genomics Consortium (AGC, https://mvs.unimelb.edu.au/amphibian-genomics-consortium ) in early 2023. This burgeoning community already has more than 282 members from 41 countries. The AGC aims to leverage the diverse capabilities of its members to advance genomic resources for amphibians and bridge the implementation gap between biologists, bioinformaticians, and conservation practitioners.

37390512,A platform for the rapid synthesis of molecular glues (Rapid-Glue) under miniaturized conditions for direct biological screening.,"Molecular glues, functioning via inducing degradation of the target protein while having similar molecular weight as traditional small molecule drugs, are emerging as a promising modality for the development of therapeutic agents. However, the development of molecular glues is limited by the lack of general principles and systematic methods. Not surprisingly, most molecular glues have been identified serendipitously or through phenotypic screening of large libraries. However, the preparation of large and diverse molecular glue libraries is not an easy task and requires extensive resources. We previously developed platforms for rapid synthesis of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that can be used directly for biological screening with minimal resources. Herein, we report a platform of rapid synthesis of molecular glues (Rapid-Glue) via a micromolar scale coupling reaction between hydrazide motif on the E3 ligase ligands and commercially available aldehydes with diverse structures. A pilot library of 1520 compounds is generated under miniaturized conditions in a high throughput manner without any further manipulation including purification after the synthesis. Through this platform, we identified two highly selective GSPT1 molecular glues through direct screening in cell-based assays. Three additional analogues were prepared from readily available starting materials by replacing the hydrolytic labile acylhydrazone linker with a more stable amide linker based on the two hits. All three analogues showed significant GSPT1 degradation activity and two of them possess comparable activity to the corresponding hit. The feasibility of our strategy is thus verified. Further studies by increasing the diversity and size of the library followed by appropriate assays will likely yield distinct molecular glues targeting novel neo-substrates.",False,True,,0.65345365,rapid-glue,,16.922599599999998,ok,,,,v2,0.9225996,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Only the determination of both the non-volatile and the volatile organic compound (mVOC) production by microorganisms allows a holistic view for understanding the complete potential of metabolomes and metabolic capabilities of bacteria.

35576425,D<sup>2</sup>-Net: Dual Disentanglement Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation With Missing Modalities.,"Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide complementary information for automatic brain tumor segmentation, which is crucial for diagnosis and prognosis. While missing modality data is common in clinical practice and it can result in the collapse of most previous methods relying on complete modality data. Current state-of-the-art approaches cope with the situations of missing modalities by fusing multi-modal images and features to learn shared representations of tumor regions, which often ignore explicitly capturing the correlations among modalities and tumor regions. Inspired by the fact that modality information plays distinct roles to segment different tumor regions, we aim to explicitly exploit the correlations among various modality-specific information and tumor-specific knowledge for segmentation. To this end, we propose a Dual Disentanglement Network (D<sup>2</sup>-Net) for brain tumor segmentation with missing modalities, which consists of a modality disentanglement stage (MD-Stage) and a tumor-region disentanglement stage (TD-Stage). In the MD-Stage, a spatial-frequency joint modality contrastive learning scheme is designed to directly decouple the modality-specific information from MRI data. To decompose tumor-specific representations and extract discriminative holistic features, we propose an affinity-guided dense tumor-region knowledge distillation mechanism in the TD-Stage through aligning the features of a disentangled binary teacher network with a holistic student network. By explicitly discovering relations among modalities and tumor regions, our model can learn sufficient information for segmentation even if some modalities are missing. Extensive experiments on the public BraTS-2018 database demonstrate the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art methods in missing modalities situations.

Some exposures, e.g., smoking or lipid levels, have common genetic modifiers identified in genome-wide association studies. Because measurements are often unfeasible, exposure polygenic risk scores (ExPRSs) offer an alternative to study the influence of exposures on various phenotypes. Here, we collected publicly available summary statistics for 28 exposures and applied four common PRS methods to generate ExPRSs in two large biobanks: the Michigan Genomics Initiative and the UK Biobank. We established ExPRSs for 27 exposures and demonstrated their applicability in phenome-wide association studies and as predictors for common chronic conditions. Especially the addition of multiple ExPRSs showed, for several chronic conditions, an improvement compared to prediction models that only included traditional, disease-focused PRSs.

Such a platform would represent the extensive and complex landscape of IEIs and could increase the rate of diagnosis in patients with a suspected IEI, which remains unacceptably low.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim was to create an expertly curated, patient-centered, multidimensional IEI database that enables aggregation and sophisticated data interrogation and promotes involvement from diverse stakeholders across the community.<h4>Methods</h4>The database structure was designed following a subject-centered model and written in Structured Query Language (SQL). The web application is written in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript. All data stored in the Genetic Immunology Advisor (GenIA) are extracted by manually reviewing published research articles.<h4>Results</h4>We completed data collection and curation for 24 pilot genes. Using these data, we have exemplified how GenIA can provide quick access to structured, longitudinal, more thorough, comprehensive, and up-to-date IEI knowledge than do currently existing databases, such as ClinGen, Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), ClinVar, or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), with which GenIA intends to dovetail.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GenIA strives to accurately capture the extensive genetic, mechanistic, and phenotypic heterogeneity found across IEIs, as well as genetic paradigms and diagnostic pitfalls associated with individual genes and conditions.

The existing databases of inorganic crystal structure prototypes were mostly constructed by classifying materials in terms of the crystallographic space group information. Herein, we employed a distinct strategy to construct the inorganic crystal structure prototype database, relying on the classification of materials in terms of local atomic environments (LAEs) accompanied by unsupervised machine learning method. Specifically, we adopted a hierarchical clustering approach onto all experimentally known inorganic crystal structure data to identify structure prototypes. The criterion for hierarchical clustering is the LAE represented by the state-of-the-art structure fingerprints of the improved bond-orientational order parameters and the smooth overlap of atomic positions. This allows us to build up a LAE-based Inorganic Crystal Structure Prototype Database (LAE-ICSPD) containing 15,613 structure prototypes with defined stoichiometries. In addition, we have developed a Structure Prototype Generator Infrastructure (SPGI) package, which is a useful toolkit for structure prototype generation.

36964864,Amazon Biobank: a collaborative genetic database for bioeconomy development.,"Biodiversity is proposed as a sustainable alternative for the economic development of high-biodiversity regions. Especially in the field of biodiversity genomics, the development of low-cost DNA sequencing opens an opportunity for new actors beyond academia to engage in genomic sequencing. However, it is challenging to adequately compensate non-academic actors such as local populations for their contribution to the innovation process, preventing better bioeconomy development. Although many repositories register genomic data to support biodiversity research, they do not facilitate the fair sharing of economic benefits. In this work, we propose the creation of the Amazon Biobank, a community-based genetic database. We employed blockchain to build a transparent and verifiable log of transactions involving genomic data, and we used smart contracts to implement an internal monetary system for all participants who collect, insert, process, store, and validate genomic data. We also used peer-to-peer solutions to allow users with commodity computers to collaborate with the storage and distribution of DNA files. By combining emerging technologies, Amazon Biobank provides adequate benefit-sharing among all participants that collaborate with data, knowledge, and computational resources. It also provides traceability and auditability, allowing easy association between biotechnological research and DNA data.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to avoid thermodynamically infeasible loops in flux samples when using convex samplers on large metabolic models. Current strategies for randomly sampling the non-convex loopless flux space display limited efficiency and lack theoretical guarantees.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present LooplessFluxSampler, an efficient algorithm for exploring the loopless mass-balanced flux solution space of metabolic models, based on an Adaptive Directions Sampling on a Box (ADSB) algorithm. ADSB is rooted in the general Adaptive Direction Sampling (ADS) framework, specifically the Parallel ADS, for which theoretical convergence and irreducibility results are available for sampling from arbitrary distributions. By sampling directions that adapt to the target distribution, ADSB traverses more efficiently the sample space achieving faster mixing than other methods. Importantly, the presented algorithm is guaranteed to target the uniform distribution over convex regions, and it provably converges on the latter distribution over more general (non-convex) regions provided the sample can have full support.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LooplessFluxSampler enables scalable statistical inference of the loopless mass-balanced solution space of large metabolic models. Grounded in a theoretically sound framework, this toolbox provides not only efficient but also reliable results for exploring the properties of the almost surely non-convex loopless flux space.

38398771,A Federated Database for Obesity Research: An IMI-SOPHIA Study.,"Obesity is considered by many as a lifestyle choice rather than a chronic progressive disease. The Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) SOPHIA (Stratification of Obesity Phenotypes to Optimize Future Obesity Therapy) project is part of a momentum shift aiming to provide better tools for the stratification of people with obesity according to disease risk and treatment response. One of the challenges to achieving these goals is that many clinical cohorts are siloed, limiting the potential of combined data for biomarker discovery. In SOPHIA, we have addressed this challenge by setting up a federated database building on open-source DataSHIELD technology. The database currently federates 16 cohorts that are accessible via a central gateway. The database is multi-modal, including research studies, clinical trials, and routine health data, and is accessed using the R statistical programming environment where statistical and machine learning analyses can be performed at a distance without any disclosure of patient-level data. We demonstrate the use of the database by providing a proof-of-concept analysis, performing a federated linear model of BMI and systolic blood pressure, pooling all data from 16 studies virtually without any analyst seeing individual patient-level data. This analysis provided similar point estimates compared to a meta-analysis of the 16 individual studies.

37387134,PlasBin-flow: a flow-based MILP algorithm for plasmid contigs binning.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The analysis of bacterial isolates to detect plasmids is important due to their role in the propagation of antimicrobial resistance. In short-read sequence assemblies, both plasmids and bacterial chromosomes are typically split into several contigs of various lengths, making identification of plasmids a challenging problem. In plasmid contig binning, the goal is to distinguish short-read assembly contigs based on their origin into plasmid and chromosomal contigs and subsequently sort plasmid contigs into bins, each bin corresponding to a single plasmid. Previous works on this problem consist of de novo approaches and reference-based approaches. De novo methods rely on contig features such as length, circularity, read coverage, or GC content. Reference-based approaches compare contigs to databases of known plasmids or plasmid markers from finished bacterial genomes.<h4>Results</h4>Recent developments suggest that leveraging information contained in the assembly graph improves the accuracy of plasmid binning. We present PlasBin-flow, a hybrid method that defines contig bins as subgraphs of the assembly graph. PlasBin-flow identifies such plasmid subgraphs through a mixed integer linear programming model that relies on the concept of network flow to account for sequencing coverage, while also accounting for the presence of plasmid genes and the GC content that often distinguishes plasmids from chromosomes. We demonstrate the performance of PlasBin-flow on a real dataset of bacterial samples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://github.com/cchauve/PlasBin-flow.",False,True,,0.71720827,plasbin-flow,,16.8704142,ok,,plasbin,low,v2,0.8704142,PlasBin-flow,False,0.0,True,False,https://github.com/cchauve/PlasBin-flow,,False,,1

Current PDB holdings exceed 230,000 experimentally determined structures of proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, and macromolecular machines. The RCSB Protein Data Bank RCSB.org research-focused web portal facilitates search, analyses, and visualization of every PDB structure along with more than one million Computed Structure Models from AlphaFold DB and the ModelArchive. It is powered by a set of publicly available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that both support RCSB.org users and provide programmatic access to PDB data. Given the breadth and levels of granularity encompassed in this rich data collection, efficiently accessing the information programmatically may be challenging for new users. RCSB PDB has developed a Python software package, rcsb-api, that facilitates easy and efficient use of RCSB PDB APIs within a Python environment. This software tool is designed to streamline access to the extensive corpus of data housed within the PDB, enabling researchers to search, retrieve, and analyze 3D biostructure data seamlessly.

39231169,Foodprint 2.0: A computational simulation model that estimates the agricultural resource requirements of diet patterns.,"Reducing the environmental pressures stemming from food production is central to meeting global sustainability targets. Shifting diets represents one lever for improving food system sustainability, and identifying sustainable diet opportunities requires computational models to represent complex systems and allow users to evaluate counterfactual scenarios. Despite an increase in the number of food system sustainability models, there remains a lack of transparency of data inputs and mathematical formulas to facilitate replication by researchers and application by diverse stakeholders. Further, many models lack the ability to model multiple geographic scales. The present study introduces Foodprint 2.0, which fills both gaps. Foodprint 2.0 is an updated biophysical simulation model that estimates the agricultural resource requirements of diet patterns and can be adapted to suit a variety of research purposes. The objectives of this study are to: 1) describe the new features of Foodprint 2.0, and 2) demonstrate model performance by estimating the agricultural resource requirements of food demand in the United States (US) using nationally representative dietary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2009-2018. New features of the model include embedded functions to integrate individual-level dietary data that allow for variance estimation; new data and calculations to account for the resource requirements of food trade and farmed aquatic food; updated user interface; expanded output data for over 200 foods that include the use of fertilizer nutrients, pesticides, and irrigation water; supplementary files that include input data for all parameters on an annual basis from 1999-2018; sample programming code; and step-by-step instructions for users. This study demonstrates that animal-sourced foods consumed in the US accounted for the greatest share of total land use, fertilizer nutrient use, pesticide use, and irrigation water use, followed by grains, fruits, and vegetables. Greater adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans was associated with lower use of land and fertilizer nutrients, and greater use of pesticides and irrigation water.

EchinoDB is a database of genomic and transcriptomic data on echinoderms. The initial database consisted of groups of 749,397 orthologous and paralogous transcripts arranged in orthoclusters by sequence similarity.<h4>Results</h4>The updated version of EchinoDB includes two new major datasets: the RNA-Seq data of the brittle star Ophioderma brevispinum and the high-quality genomic assembly data of the green sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. In addition, we enabled keyword searches for annotated data and installed an updated version of Sequenceserver to allow Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches. The data are downloadable in FASTA format. The first version of EchinoDB appeared in 2016 and was implemented in GO on a local server. The new version has been updated using R Shiny to include new features and improvements in the application. Furthermore, EchinoDB now runs entirely in the cloud for increased reliability and scaling.<h4>Conclusion</h4>EchinoDB serves a user base drawn from the fields of phylogenetics, developmental biology, genomics, physiology, neurobiology, and regeneration. As use cases, we illustrate the function of EchinoDB in retrieving components of signaling pathways involved in the tissue regeneration process of different echinoderms, including the emerging model species Ophioderma brevispinum. Moreover, we use EchinoDB to shed light on the conservation of the molecular components involved in two echinoderm-specific phenomena: spicule matrix proteins involved in the formation of stereom endoskeleton and the tensilin protein that contributes to the capacity of the connective tissues to quickly change its mechanical properties. The genes involved in the former had been previously studied in echinoids, while gene sequences involved in the latter had been previously described in holothuroids. Specifically, we ask (a) if the biomineralization-related proteins previously reported only in sea urchins are also present in other, non-echinoid, echinoderms and (b) if tensilin, the protein responsible for the control of stiffness of the mutable collagenous tissue, previously described in sea cucumbers, is conserved across the phylum.",False,True,,0.71924114,chinodb,,16.8592423,ok,,echinodb,,v2,0.8592423,EchinoDB,True,1.0,False,False,https://echinodb.uncc.edu,https://echinodb.uncc.edu,True,"...elease a new version of EchinoDB, EchinoDB v2.0 ( https://echinodb.uncc.edu ).

40549542,Extraction of biological terms using large language models enhances the usability of metadata in the BioSample database.,"BioSample is a repository of experimental sample metadata. It is a comprehensive archive that enables searches of experiments, regardless of type. However, there is substantial variability in the submitted metadata due to the difficulty in defining comprehensive rules for describing them and the limited user awareness of best practices in creating them. This inconsistency poses considerable challenges to the findability and reusability of archived data. Given the scale of BioSample, which hosts over 40 million records, manual curation is impractical. Automatic rule-based ontology mapping methods have been proposed to address this issue, but their effectiveness is limited by the heterogeneity of the metadata. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention in natural language processing and are promising tools for automating metadata curation. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in extracting cell line names from BioSample descriptions using a gold-standard dataset derived from ChIP-Atlas, a secondary database of epigenomics experiment data in which samples were manually curated. The LLM-assisted methods outperformed traditional approaches, achieving higher accuracy and coverage. We further extended them to extract information about experimentally manipulated genes from metadata when manual curation had not yet been applied in ChIP-Atlas. This also yielded successful results, including the facilitation of more precise filtering of the data and the prevention of possible misinterpretations caused by the inclusion of unintended data. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs in improving the findability and reusability of experimental data in general, which would considerably reduce the user workload and enable more effective scientific data management.",False,True,,0.70885473,biosample,,16.8562804,ok,,chip-atlas,,v2,0.8562804,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Its increasing consensus over the last decades fostered the development of innovative tools, allowing network theory to model a variety of different scenarios while answering questions of increasing complexity. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of spectral graph theory's principles requires a solid technical background which, in many cases, prevents its diffusion through the scientific community. To overcome such an issue, we developed and released an open-source MATLAB toolbox - SPectral graph theory And Random walK (SPARK) toolbox - that combines spectral graph theory and random walk concepts to provide a both static and dynamic characterization of digraphs. Once described the theoretical principles grounding the toolbox, we presented SPARK structure and the list of available indices and measures. SPARK was then tested in a variety of scenarios including: two-toy examples on synthetic networks, an example using public datasets in which SPARK was used as an unsupervised binary classifier and a real data scenario relying on functional brain networks extracted from the EEG data recorded from two stroke patients in resting state condition. Results from both synthetic and real data showed that indices extracted using SPARK toolbox allow to correctly characterize the topology of a bi-compartmental network. Furthermore, they could also be used to find the ""optimal"" vertex set partition (i.e., the one that minimizes the number of between-cluster links) for the underlying network and compare it to a given a priori partition.

34837217,The Intelligent Phenotypic Plasticity Platform (IP<sup>3</sup>) for Precision Medicine-Based Injury Prevention in Sport.,"The best predictor of future injury is previous injury and this has not changed in a quarter century despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Regardless of formal care, these athletes remain two to four times more likely to suffer a second injury for several years after RTP. In the case of children and young adults, this sets them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. Thus, the initial injury is the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs, and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. This chapter details the technologies and method that make up the automated Intelligent Phenotypic Plasticity Platform (IP<sup>3</sup>)-a revolutionary new approach to the current standard of post-injury care that identifies and targets deficits that underly second injury risk in sport. IP<sup>3</sup> capitalizes on the biological concept of phenotypic plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete's functional adaptability across different performance environments, and it is implemented in two distinct steps: (1) phenomic profiling and (2) precision treatment. Phenomic profiling indexes the fitness and subsequent phenotypic plasticity of an individual athlete, which drives the personalization of the precision treatment step. IP<sup>3</sup> leverages mixed-reality technologies to present true-to-life environments that test the athlete's ability to adapt to dynamic stressors. The athlete's phenotypic plasticity profile is then used to drive a precision treatment that systematically stresses the athlete, via a combination of behavioral-based and genetic fuzzy system models, to optimally enhance the athlete's functional adaptability. IP<sup>3</sup> is computationally light-weight and, through the integration with mixed-reality technologies, promotes real-time prediction, responsiveness, and adaptation. It is also the first ever phenotypic plasticity-based precision medicine platform, and the first precision sports medicine platform of any kind.",False,True,,0.61858565,phenotypic plasticity platform,,16.845293339999998,ok,,intelligent phenotypic plasticity platform,rtp,v2,0.84529334,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

38868518,Recent advances in the characterization of essential genes and development of a database of essential genes.,"Over the past few decades, there has been a significant interest in the study of essential genes, which are crucial for the survival of an organism under specific environmental conditions and thus have practical applications in the fields of synthetic biology and medicine. An increasing amount of experimental data on essential genes has been obtained with the continuous development of technological methods. Meanwhile, various computational prediction methods, related databases and web servers have emerged accordingly. To facilitate the study of essential genes, we have established a database of essential genes (DEG), which has become popular with continuous updates to facilitate essential gene feature analysis and prediction, drug and vaccine development, as well as artificial genome design and construction. In this article, we summarized the studies of essential genes, overviewed the relevant databases, and discussed their practical applications. Furthermore, we provided an overview of the main applications of DEG and conducted comprehensive analyses based on its latest version. However, it should be noted that the essential gene is a dynamic concept instead of a binary one, which presents both opportunities and challenges for their future development.",False,True,,0.7194726,database of essential genes,,16.8414839,ok,,,deg,v2,0.8414839,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40359222,Malicious traffic prediction model for ResNet based on Maple-IDS dataset.,"In light of the increasing threat posed by cyberattacks, it is imperative for organizations to accurately identify malicious network traffic. However, the imbalance among various attack categories diminishes the accuracy of model predictions. To address this issue, we propose the Maple-IDS dataset as an innovative solution. We utilize DPDK along with its zero-copy (ZC) technology and BPF compiler to compile filtering rules. Additionally, a headless client is employed to generate control traffic, thereby preventing overfitting. Our data collections are sourced from a variety of operating systems and middleware platforms, ensuring broad applicability and relevance. By comparing our dataset with the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, we achieve a more balanced representation of attack data, which enhances the model's learning performance. To tackle the challenges of low accuracy and slow convergence speed in existing network security situation predictions, we propose a network situation awareness prediction model that integrates a residual network with an improved attention mechanism. This model leverages the attention mechanism to assign greater weight to abnormal data, thereby facilitating the accurate identification of anomalies within large data streams. Furthermore, the residual network accelerates convergence speed, enhances the model's expressive capability, and improves the efficiency of rapid response to attacks. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of predicting attack data flows reaches an impressive 99.83%, which significantly aids in the early detection of network security threats and enables preemptive measures to maintain normal network operations.",False,True,,0.69798267,,ds,16.8412464,ok,,,resnet | cic,v2,0.8412464,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

38924085,Surveying the welfare of farmed fish species on a global scale through the fair-fish database.,"Fish welfare is a critical issue that needs to be addressed by the rapidly growing aquaculture industry. Scientific knowledge regarding the natural behaviors of species and the conditions in which they are kept in farms is essential for improving their welfare in aquaculture. To provide a consistent overview of the welfare of farmed fish, the organization fair-fish has created the online platform fair-fish database, which gathers ethological knowledge categorized into profiles of farmed aquatic species. The WelfareChecks on this platform are profiles based on criteria that are rated based on the likelihood and potential of the species to experience a high level of welfare in aquaculture systems, together with the certainty about the findings. A score (WelfareScore) is calculated from these ratings, serving as a reference to identify knowledge gaps, assess welfare, and suggest ways to improve it. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the species with WelfareChecks already published in the fair-fish database based on their respective WelfareScores. In general, although just a small percentage of farmed aquatic species (~5%) have at least a 20% chance of experiencing a good level of welfare under minimal aquaculture conditions, 60% of them have at least some potential to achieve good welfare under high-standard conditions, with more than a third of the species (~37%) having at least a 20% potential. Despite that, several species exhibit a very high frequency of low chances and potential for experiencing good welfare levels under aquaculture conditions, besides a low degree of certainty based on literature reviews. Furthermore, many others show a very frequent occurrence of unclear or nonexistent knowledge in their profiles. The current welfare state is therefore poor for the majority of farmed aquatic species; yet, there is considerable potential for improvement. However, many species are very unlikely to achieve good welfare, even under high-standard conditions. Importantly, large knowledge gaps remain for an accurate assessment of the welfare of several farmed species.",False,True,,0.61335856,fair-fish,,16.840834559999998,ok,,welfarechecks,,v2,0.84083456,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

35386279,SGII: Systematic Identification of Essential lncRNAs in Mouse and Human Genome With lncRNA-Protein-Protein Heterogeneous Interaction Network.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a variety of biological processes. Knocking out or knocking down some lncRNA genes can lead to death or infertility. These lncRNAs are called essential lncRNAs. Identifying the essential lncRNA is of importance for complex disease diagnosis and treatments. However, experimental methods for identifying essential lncRNAs are always costly and time consuming. Therefore, computational methods can be considered as an alternative approach. We propose a method to identify essential lncRNAs by combining network centrality measures and lncRNA sequence information. By constructing a lncRNA-protein-protein interaction network, we measure the essentiality of lncRNAs from their role in the network and their sequence together. We name our method as the systematic gene importance index (SGII). As far as we can tell, this is the first attempt to identify essential lncRNAs by combining sequence and network information together. The results of our method indicated that essential lncRNAs have similar roles in the LPPI network as the essential coding genes in the PPI network. Another encouraging observation is that the network information can significantly boost the predictive performance of sequence-based method.

38768239,Where's Whaledo: A software toolkit for array localization of animal vocalizations.,"Where's Whaledo is a software toolkit that uses a combination of automated processes and user interfaces to greatly accelerate the process of reconstructing animal tracks from arrays of passive acoustic recording devices. Passive acoustic localization is a non-invasive yet powerful way to contribute to species conservation. By tracking animals through their acoustic signals, important information on diving patterns, movement behavior, habitat use, and feeding dynamics can be obtained. This method is useful for helping to understand habitat use, observe behavioral responses to noise, and develop potential mitigation strategies. Animal tracking using passive acoustic localization requires an acoustic array to detect signals of interest, associate detections on various receivers, and estimate the most likely source location by using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) of sounds on multiple receivers. Where's Whaledo combines data from two small-aperture volumetric arrays and a variable number of individual receivers. In a case study conducted in the Tanner Basin off Southern California, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Where's Whaledo in localizing groups of Ziphius cavirostris.

37013005,Pipeline for characterizing alternative mechanisms (PCAM) based on bi-clustering to study colorectal cancer heterogeneity.,"The cells of colorectal cancer (CRC) in their microenvironment experience constant stress, leading to dysregulated activity in the tumor niche. As a result, cancer cells acquire alternative pathways in response to the changing microenvironment, posing significant challenges for the design of effective cancer treatment strategies. While computational studies on high-throughput omics data have advanced our understanding of CRC subtypes, characterizing the heterogeneity of this disease remains remarkably complex. Here, we present a novel computational Pipeline for Characterizing Alternative Mechanisms (PCAM) based on biclustering to gain a more detailed understanding of cancer heterogeneity. Our application of PCAM to large-scale CRC transcriptomics datasets suggests that PCAM can generate a wealth of information leading to new biological understanding and predictive markers of alternative mechanisms. Our key findings include: 1) A comprehensive collection of alternative pathways in CRC, associated with biological and clinical factors. 2) Full annotation of detected alternative mechanisms, including their enrichment in known pathways and associations with various clinical outcomes. 3) A mechanistic relationship between known clinical subtypes and outcomes on a consensus map, visualized by the presence of alternative mechanisms. 4) Several potential novel alternative drug resistance mechanisms for Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and FOLFOX, some of which were validated on independent datasets. We believe that gaining a deeper understanding of alternative mechanisms is a critical step towards characterizing the heterogeneity of CRC. The hypotheses generated by PCAM, along with the comprehensive collection of biologically and clinically associated alternative pathways in CRC, could provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving cancer progression and drug resistance, which could aid in the development of more effective cancer therapies and guide experimental design towards more targeted and personalized treatment strategies.

37646933,The Plant Phenomics and Genomics Research Data Repository: An On-Premise Approach for FAIR-Compliant Data Acquisition.,"The FAIR data principle as a commitment to support long-term research data management is widely accepted in the scientific community. However, although many established infrastructures provide comprehensive and long-term stable services and platforms, a large quantity of research data is still hidden. Currently, high-throughput plant genomics and phenomics technologies are producing research data in abundance, the storage of which is not covered by established core databases. This concerns the data volume, for example, time series of images or high-resolution hyperspectral data; the quality of data formatting and annotation, e.g., with regard to structure and annotation specifications of core databases; uncovered data domains; or organizational constraints prohibiting primary data storage outside institutional boundaries. To share these potentially dark data in a FAIR way and master these challenges the ELIXIR Germany/de.NBI service Plant Genomic and Phenomics Research Data Repository (PGP) implements an on-premise approach, which allows research data to be kept in place and wrapped in FAIR-aware software infrastructure.

However, working with and especially curating public omics datasets remains challenging despite these efforts. While a growing number of initiatives aim to re-use previous results, these present limitations that often lead to the need for further in-house curation and processing.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the Omics Dataset Curation Toolkit (OMD Curation Toolkit), a python3 package designed to accompany and guide the researcher during the curation process of metadata and fastq files of public omics datasets. This workflow provides a standardized framework with multiple capabilities (collection, control check, treatment and integration) to facilitate the arduous task of curating public sequencing data projects. While centered on the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), the majority of the provided tools are generic and can be used to curate datasets from different sources.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Thus, it offers valuable tools for the in-house curation previously needed to re-use public omics data.

38442048,LA-ViT: A Network With Transformers Constrained by Learned-Parameter-Free Attention for Interpretable Grading in a New Laryngeal Histopathology Image Dataset.,"Grading laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) based on histopathological images is a clinically significant yet challenging task. However, more low-effect background semantic information appeared in the feature maps, feature channels, and class activation maps, which caused a serious impact on the accuracy and interpretability of LSCC grading. While the traditional transformer block makes extensive use of parameter attention, the model overlearns the low-effect background semantic information, resulting in ineffectively reducing the proportion of background semantics. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end network with transformers constrained by learned-parameter-free attention (LA-ViT), which improve the ability to learn high-effect target semantic information and reduce the proportion of background semantics. Firstly, according to generalized linear model and probabilistic, we demonstrate that learned-parameter-free attention (LA) has a stronger ability to learn highly effective target semantic information than parameter attention. Secondly, the first-type LA transformer block of LA-ViT utilizes the feature map position subspace to realize the query. Then, it uses the feature channel subspace to realize the key, and adopts the average convergence to obtain a value. And those construct the LA mechanism. Thus, it reduces the proportion of background semantics in the feature maps and feature channels. Thirdly, the second-type LA transformer block of LA-ViT uses the model probability matrix information and decision level weight information to realize key and query, respectively. And those realize the LA mechanism. So, it reduces the proportion of background semantics in class activation maps. Finally, we build a new complex semantic LSCC pathology image dataset to address the problem, which is less research on LSCC grading models because of lacking clinically meaningful datasets. After extensive experiments, the whole metrics of LA-ViT outperform those of other state-of-the-art methods, and the visualization maps match better with the regions of interest in the pathologists' decision-making. Moreover, the experimental results conducted on a public LSCC pathology image dataset show that LA-ViT has superior generalization performance to that of other state-of-the-art methods.",False,True,,0.6289039,,it,16.803853500000002,ok,,laryngeal histopathology image dataset,la-vit,v2,0.8038535,LA-ViT,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37436815,The FeatureCloud Platform for Federated Learning in Biomedicine: Unified Approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>Machine learning and artificial intelligence have shown promising results in many areas and are driven by the increasing amount of available data. However, these data are often distributed across different institutions and cannot be easily shared owing to strict privacy regulations. Federated learning (FL) allows the training of distributed machine learning models without sharing sensitive data. In addition, the implementation is time-consuming and requires advanced programming skills and complex technical infrastructures.<h4>Objective</h4>Various tools and frameworks have been developed to simplify the development of FL algorithms and provide the necessary technical infrastructure. Although there are many high-quality frameworks, most focus only on a single application case or method. To our knowledge, there are no generic frameworks, meaning that the existing solutions are restricted to a particular type of algorithm or application field. Furthermore, most of these frameworks provide an application programming interface that needs programming knowledge. There is no collection of ready-to-use FL algorithms that are extendable and allow users (eg, researchers) without programming knowledge to apply FL. A central FL platform for both FL algorithm developers and users does not exist. This study aimed to address this gap and make FL available to everyone by developing FeatureCloud, an all-in-one platform for FL in biomedicine and beyond.<h4>Methods</h4>The FeatureCloud platform consists of 3 main components: a global frontend, a global backend, and a local controller. Our platform uses a Docker to separate the local acting components of the platform from the sensitive data systems. We evaluated our platform using 4 different algorithms on 5 data sets for both accuracy and runtime.<h4>Results</h4>FeatureCloud removes the complexity of distributed systems for developers and end users by providing a comprehensive platform for executing multi-institutional FL analyses and implementing FL algorithms. Through its integrated artificial intelligence store, federated algorithms can easily be published and reused by the community. To secure sensitive raw data, FeatureCloud supports privacy-enhancing technologies to secure the shared local models and assures high standards in data privacy to comply with the strict General Data Protection Regulation. Our evaluation shows that applications developed in FeatureCloud can produce highly similar results compared with centralized approaches and scale well for an increasing number of participating sites.<h4>Conclusions</h4>FeatureCloud provides a ready-to-use platform that integrates the development and execution of FL algorithms while reducing the complexity to a minimum and removing the hurdles of federated infrastructure. Thus, we believe that it has the potential to greatly increase the accessibility of privacy-preserving and distributed data analyses in biomedicine and beyond.",False,True,,0.69175285,eaturecloud,,16.80014324,ok,,featurecloud,,v2,0.80014324,FeatureCloud Platform for Federated Learning in Biomedicine,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To our knowledge, models based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have achieved good results in this task. Unfortunately, these models only consider text in the current document, fail to capture dependencies with other documents, and lack sufficient mining of hidden information in contextual texts.<h4>Results</h4>We propose B-LBConA, which is based on Bio-LinkBERT and context-aware mechanism. Specifically, B-LBConA first utilizes Bio-LinkBERT, which is capable of learning cross-document dependencies, to obtain embedding representations of mentions and candidate entities. Then, cross-attention is used to capture the interaction information of mention-to-entity and entity-to-mention. Finally, B-LBConA incorporates disambiguation clues about the relevance between the mention context and candidate entities via the context-aware mechanism.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Experiment results on three publicly available datasets, NCBI, ADR and ShARe/CLEF, show that B-LBConA achieves a signifcantly more accurate performance compared with existing models.",False,True,,0.6960138,,lbcona,16.7950474,ok,,b-lbcona | linkbert,,v2,0.7950474,B-LBConA,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To evaluate the system, a user study was conducted, involving 27 participants who completed pre- and post-study surveys and three research tasks. Analysis of the study results confirmed the feasibility and practicality of ICPUTRD to facilitate aspects of forensic research and casework involving large collections of digital photographs of human decomposition.

36402991,USAT: a bioinformatic toolkit to facilitate interpretation and comparative visualization of tandem repeat sequences.,"<h4>Background</h4>Tandem repeats (TR), highly variable genomic variants, are widely used in individual identification, disease diagnostics, and evolutionary studies. The recent advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools facilitate calling TR haplotypes genome widely. Both length-based and sequence-based TR alleles are used in different applications. However, sequence-based TR alleles could provide the highest precision in characterizing TR haplotypes.

36321973,Expanded FLP toolbox for spatiotemporal protein degradation and transcriptomic profiling in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Control of gene expression in specific tissues and/or at certain stages of development allows the study and manipulation of gene function with high precision. Site-specific genome recombination by the flippase (FLP) and cyclization recombination (Cre) enzymes has proved particularly relevant. Joint efforts of many research groups have led to the creation of efficient FLP and Cre drivers to regulate gene expression in a variety of tissues in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we extend this toolkit by the addition of FLP lines that drive recombination specifically in distal tip cells, the somatic gonad, coelomocytes, and the epithelial P lineage. In some cases, recombination-mediated gene knockouts do not completely deplete protein levels due to persistence of long-lived proteins. To overcome this, we developed a spatiotemporally regulated degradation system for green fluorescent fusion proteins based on FLP-mediated recombination. Using 2 stable nuclear pore proteins, MEL-28/ELYS and NPP-2/NUP85 as examples, we report the benefit of combining tissue-specific gene knockout and protein degradation to achieve complete protein depletion. We also demonstrate that FLP-mediated recombination can be utilized to identify transcriptomes in a C. elegans tissue of interest. We have adapted RNA polymerase DamID for the FLP toolbox and by focusing on a well-characterized tissue, the hypodermis, we show that the vast majority of genes identified by RNA polymerase DamID are known to be expressed in this tissue.

38177985,"Prop3D: A flexible, Python-based platform for machine learning with protein structural properties and biophysical data.","<h4>Background</h4>Machine learning (ML) has a rich history in structural bioinformatics, and modern approaches, such as deep learning, are revolutionizing our knowledge of the subtle relationships between biomolecular sequence, structure, function, dynamics and evolution. As with any advance that rests upon statistical learning approaches, the recent progress in biomolecular sciences is enabled by the availability of vast volumes of sufficiently-variable data. To be useful, such data must be well-structured, machine-readable, intelligible and manipulable. These and related requirements pose challenges that become especially acute at the computational scales typical in ML. Furthermore, in structural bioinformatics such data generally relate to protein three-dimensional (3D) structures, which are inherently more complex than sequence-based data. A significant and recurring challenge concerns the creation of large, high-quality, openly-accessible datasets that can be used for specific training and benchmarking tasks in ML pipelines for predictive modeling projects, along with reproducible splits for training and testing.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we report 'Prop3D', a platform that allows for the creation, sharing and extensible reuse of libraries of protein domains, featurized with biophysical and evolutionary properties that can range from detailed, atomically-resolved physicochemical quantities (e.g., electrostatics) to coarser, residue-level features (e.g., phylogenetic conservation). As a community resource, we also supply a 'Prop3D-20sf' protein dataset, obtained by applying our approach to CATH . We have developed and deployed the Prop3D framework, both in the cloud and on local HPC resources, to systematically and reproducibly create comprehensive datasets via the Highly Scalable Data Service ( HSDS ). Our datasets are freely accessible via a public HSDS instance, or they can be used with accompanying Python wrappers for popular ML frameworks.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Prop3D and its associated Prop3D-20sf dataset can be of broad utility in at least three ways. Firstly, the Prop3D workflow code can be customized and deployed on various cloud-based compute platforms, with scalability achieved largely by saving the results to distributed HDF5 files via HSDS . Secondly, the linked Prop3D-20sf dataset provides a hand-crafted, already-featurized dataset of protein domains for 20 highly-populated CATH families; importantly, provision of this pre-computed resource can aid the more efficient development (and reproducible deployment) of ML pipelines.

Our analysis identified ncRNAs associated with various sensory neuron stages. Striking similarities in ncRNA expression signatures between human DRG and iPSC-derived neurons support the latter as a model to bridge the translational gap between preclinical findings and human disorders.

39964163,Gene regulatory network resource aids in predicting trans-acting regulators of biosynthetic gene clusters in &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/i&gt;.,"The field of secondary metabolism has greatly benefitted from computational advances in recent years. This has been particularly true for fungal natural product studies. Strides in genome mining have led to the identification of an extraordinary number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across the fungal Kingdom and metabologenomic platforms can group BGCs into gene cluster families and link them to initial chemical structures. Missing are computational applications focused on identifying BGC regulatory networks. Here, we applied the new online gene regulatory network resource, GRAsp (<u>G</u>ene <u>R</u>egulation of <i><u>Asp</u>ergillus fumigatus</i>), to identify unknown and unpredictable BGC trans-acting transcriptional/metabolite production modules. GRAsp correctly predicted a two-component regulatory module composed of the transcription factors (TFs), RogA (<u>r</u>egulation <u>o</u>f <u>g</u>liotoxin) and HsfA, which negatively regulate the gliotoxin BGC and are also involved in gliotoxin self-protection. RogA functions through the repression of <i>gliZ,</i> the pathway-specific gliotoxin TF, and HsfA functions by activating <i>rogA</i> expression. Furthermore, GRAsp identified TFs that regulate the production of two BGCs lacking pathway-specific TFs, the helvolic acid and fumitremorgin BGCs, respectively. Finally, the known TF, NsdD, was predicted and found to regulate the hexadehydroastechrome BGC. These advances highlight the power of inference algorithms to uncover unpredictable networks in specialized metabolite synthesis.IMPORTANCEToxic secondary metabolites are virulence factors of the opportunistic fungal pathogen <i>Aspergillus fumigatus,</i> yet the transcriptional networks regulating secondary metabolite production remain elusive. Uncovering novel regulators without any prior information is challenging. Computational programs have gained prominence in the field of secondary metabolite research due to their accuracy and ability to handle vast amounts of data, including DNA, RNA, and protein data. In this study, a newly developed online computer platform, Gene Regulation of <i>A. fumigatus</i>, was used to identify five regulators involved in the production of several <i>A. fumigatus</i> toxins, including gliotoxin, helvolic acid, fumitremorgin, and hexadehydroastechrome.

40990037,AEnet: a practical tool to construct the splicing-associated phenotype atlas at a single cell level.,"Alternative splicing (AS), a crucial driver of proteomic diversity, is a fundamental source of cellular heterogeneity alongside gene expression levels. AS is closely linked to various physiological and pathological processes, including tumor progression and embryonic development. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies capture AS events through junction reads at cellular resolution, enabling the identification of core AS events that regulate specific cell types or states. However, single-cell sequencing technologies and their data are plagued by inherent limitations, such as shallow sequencing depth, high dropout rates, and batch effects. Furthermore, previous clustering approaches have overlooked the crucial interplay between AS and gene expression in defining distinct ""cell types,"" posing ongoing challenges in this field. In this study, we present a novel method called Alternative Splicing-Gene Expression Network (AEnet), which combines gene expression levels with AS patterns to profile cellular heterogeneity and define what we term ""cell subpopulations."" AEnet also identifies key AS events and infers the regulatory mechanisms underlying these events. By applying AEnet to tumor cells, pan-cancer immune cells, and embryonic cells, we demonstrate enhanced cell clustering, the identification of novel AS events with potential functional importance, and the discovery of the key splicing factors involved in cell state transitions.

Therefore, reliable software to convert mmCIF structure files to PDB files is needed. Unfortunately, existing conversion programs fail to correctly convert many mmCIF files, especially those with many atoms and/or long chain identifies.<h4>Results</h4>This study proposed BeEM, which converts any mmCIF format structure files to PDB format. BeEM conversion faithfully retains all atomic and chain information, including chain IDs with more than 2 characters, which are not supported by any existing mmCIF to PDB converters. The conversion speed of BeEM is at least ten times faster than existing converters such as MAXIT and Phenix. Part of the reason for the speed improvement is the avoidance of conversion between numerical values and text strings.<h4>Conclusion</h4>BeEM is a fast and accurate tool for mmCIF-to-PDB format conversion, which is a common procedure in structural biology.

36549193,C<sup>2</sup>BA-UNet: A context-coordination multi-atlas boundary-aware UNet-like method for PET/CT images based tumor segmentation.,"Tumor segmentation is a necessary step in clinical processing that can help doctors diagnose tumors and plan surgical treatments. Since tumors are usually small, the locations and appearances vary substantially across individuals, and the contrast between tumors and adjacent normal tissues is low, tumor segmentation is still a challenging task. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved good results in tumor segmentation, the information about tumor boundaries has been rarely explored. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new method for automatic tumor segmentation in PET/CT images based on context-coordination and boundary-aware, termed as C<sup>2</sup>BA-UNet. We employ a UNet-like backbone network and replace the encoder with EfficientNet-B0 for efficiency. To acquire potential tumor boundaries, we propose a new multi-atlas boundary-aware (MABA) module based on gradient atlas, uncertainty atlas, and level set atlas, that focuses on uncertain regions between tumors and adjacent tissues. Furthermore, we propose a new context coordination module (CCM) to combine multi-scale context information with attention mechanism to optimize skip connection in high-level layers. To validate the superiority of our method, we conduct experiments on a publicly available soft tissue sarcoma (STS) dataset and a lymphoma dataset, and the results show our method is competitive with other comparison methods.",False,True,,0.6617999,,net,16.767707350000002,ok,,efficientnet,c,v2,0.76770735,C<sup></sup>BA-UNet,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

38757367,Mutual annotation-based prediction of protein domain functions with Domain2GO.,"Identifying unknown functional properties of proteins is essential for understanding their roles in both health and disease states. The domain composition of a protein can reveal critical information in this context, as domains are structural and functional units that dictate how the protein should act at the molecular level. The expensive and time-consuming nature of wet-lab experimental approaches prompted researchers to develop computational strategies for predicting the functions of proteins. In this study, we proposed a new method called Domain2GO that infers associations between protein domains and function-defining gene ontology (GO) terms, thus redefining the problem as domain function prediction. Domain2GO uses documented protein-level GO annotations together with proteins' domain annotations. Co-annotation patterns of domains and GO terms in the same proteins are examined using statistical resampling to obtain reliable associations. As a use-case study, we evaluated the biological relevance of examples selected from the Domain2GO-generated domain-GO term mappings via literature review. Then, we applied Domain2GO to predict unknown protein functions by propagating domain-associated GO terms to proteins annotated with these domains. For function prediction performance evaluation and comparison against other methods, we employed Critical Assessment of Function Annotation 3 (CAFA3) challenge datasets. The results demonstrated the high potential of Domain2GO, particularly for predicting molecular function and biological process terms, along with advantages such as producing interpretable results and having an exceptionally low computational cost. The approach presented here can be extended to other ontologies and biological entities to investigate unknown relationships in complex and large-scale biological data.

A large number of packages and tools have been developed to correlate gene expression/mutations to the clinical outcome but lack the ability to perform such analysis based on pathways, gene sets, and gene ratios. Furthermore, in this single-cell omics era, the cluster markers from cancer single-cell transcriptomics studies remain an underutilized prognostic option. Additionally, no bioinformatics online tool evaluates the associations between the enrichment of canonical cell types and survival across cancers. Here we have developed Survival Genie, a web tool to perform survival analysis on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data and a variety of other molecular inputs such as gene sets, genes ratio, tumor-infiltrating immune cells proportion, gene expression profile scores, and tumor mutation burden.

However, the imbalance between resolution, gene capture, and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays and in situ RNA capture to create spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain.

34571541,Rossmann-toolbox: a deep learning-based protocol for the prediction and design of cofactor specificity in Rossmann fold proteins.,"The Rossmann fold enzymes are involved in essential biochemical pathways such as nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Their functioning relies on interaction with cofactors, small nucleoside-based compounds specifically recognized by a conserved βαβ motif shared by all Rossmann fold proteins. While Rossmann methyltransferases recognize only a single cofactor type, the S-adenosylmethionine, the oxidoreductases, depending on the family, bind nicotinamide (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) or flavin-based (flavin adenine dinucleotide) cofactors. In this study, we showed that despite its short length, the βαβ motif unambiguously defines the specificity towards the cofactor. Following this observation, we trained two complementary deep learning models for the prediction of the cofactor specificity based on the sequence and structural features of the βαβ motif. A benchmark on two independent test sets, one containing βαβ motifs bearing no resemblance to those of the training set, and the other comprising 38 experimentally confirmed cases of rational design of the cofactor specificity, revealed the nearly perfect performance of the two methods.

38664511,Improving speech depression detection using transfer learning with wav2vec 2.0 in low-resource environments.,"Depression, a pervasive global mental disorder, profoundly impacts daily lives. Despite numerous deep learning studies focused on depression detection through speech analysis, the shortage of annotated bulk samples hampers the development of effective models. In response to this challenge, our research introduces a transfer learning approach for detecting depression in speech, aiming to overcome constraints imposed by limited resources. In the context of feature representation, we obtain depression-related features by fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0. By integrating 1D-CNN and attention pooling structures, we generate advanced features at the segment level, thereby enhancing the model's capability to capture temporal relationships within audio frames. In the realm of prediction results, we integrate LSTM and self-attention mechanisms. This incorporation assigns greater weights to segments associated with depression, thereby augmenting the model's discernment of depression-related information. The experimental results indicate that our model has achieved impressive F1 scores, reaching 79% on the DAIC-WOZ dataset and 90.53% on the CMDC dataset. It outperforms recent baseline models in the field of speech-based depression detection.

37431591,Adding open spectral data to MassBank and PubChem using open source tools to support non-targeted exposomics of mixtures.,"The term ""exposome"" is defined as a comprehensive study of life-course environmental exposures and the associated biological responses. Humans are exposed to many different chemicals, which can pose a major threat to the well-being of humanity. Targeted or non-targeted mass spectrometry techniques are widely used to identify and characterize various environmental stressors when linking exposures to human health. However, identification remains challenging due to the huge chemical space applicable to exposomics, combined with the lack of sufficient relevant entries in spectral libraries. Addressing these challenges requires cheminformatics tools and database resources to share curated open spectral data on chemicals to improve the identification of chemicals in exposomics studies. This article describes efforts to contribute spectra relevant for exposomics to the open mass spectral library MassBank (https://www.massbank.eu) using various open source software efforts, including the R packages RMassBank and Shinyscreen. The experimental spectra were obtained from ten mixtures containing toxicologically relevant chemicals from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT). Following processing and curation, 5582 spectra from 783 of the 1268 ENTACT compounds were added to MassBank, and through this to other open spectral libraries (<i>e.g.</i>, MoNA, GNPS) for community benefit. Additionally, an automated deposition and annotation workflow was developed with PubChem to enable the display of all MassBank mass spectra in PubChem, which is rerun with each MassBank release.

37755132,Calling Cards: A Customizable Platform to Longitudinally Record Protein-DNA Interactions Over Time in Cells and Tissues.,"Calling Cards is a platform technology to record a cumulative history of transient protein-DNA interactions in the genome of genetically targeted cell types. The record of these interactions is recovered by next-generation sequencing. Compared with other genomic assays, readouts of which provide a snapshot at the time of harvest, Calling Cards enables correlation of historical molecular states to eventual outcomes or phenotypes. To achieve this, Calling Cards uses the piggyBac transposase to insert self-reporting transposon ""Calling Cards"" into the genome, leaving permanent marks at interaction sites. Calling Cards can be deployed in a variety of in vitro and in vivo biological systems to study gene regulatory networks involved in development, aging, and disease. Out of the box, it assesses enhancer usage but can be adapted to profile-specific transcription factor (TF) binding with custom TF-piggyBac fusion proteins. The Calling Cards workflow has five main stages: delivery of Calling Cards reagents, sample preparation, library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis. Here, we first present a comprehensive guide for experimental design, reagent selection, and optional customization of the platform to study additional TFs. Then, we provide an updated protocol for the five steps, using reagents that improve throughput and decrease costs, including an overview of a newly deployed computational pipeline.

36113052,The Omnitrap Platform: A Versatile Segmented Linear Ion Trap for Multidimensional Multiple-Stage Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"Multidimensional multiple-stage tandem processing of ions is demonstrated successfully in a novel segmented linear ion trap. The enhanced performance is enabled by incorporating the entire range of ion activation methods into a single platform in a highly dynamic fashion. The ion activation network comprises external injection of reagent ions, radical neutral species, photons, electrons, and collisions with neutrals. Axial segmentation of the two-dimensional trapping field provides access to a unique functionality landscape through a system of purpose-designed regions for processing ions with maximum flexibility. Design aspects of the segmented linear ion trap, termed the Omnitrap platform, are highlighted, and motion of ions trapped by rectangular waveforms is investigated experimentally by mapping the stability diagram, tracing secular frequencies, and exploring different isolation techniques. All fragmentation methods incorporated in the Omnitrap platform involving radical chemistry are shown to provide complete sequence coverage for partially unfolded ubiquitin. Three-stage (MS3) tandem mass spectrometry experiments combining collision-induced dissociation of radical ions produced by electron meta-ionization and further involving two intermediate steps of ion isolation and accumulation are performed with high efficiency, producing information rich spectra with signal-to-noise levels comparable to those obtained in a two-stage (MS2) experiment.

36494323,SPCIS: Standardized Plant Community with Introduced Status database.,"The movement of plant species across the globe exposes native communities to new species introductions. While introductions are pervasive, two aspects of variability underlie patterns and processes of biological invasions at macroecological scales. First, only a portion of introduced species become invaders capable of substantially impacting ecosystems. Second, species that do become invasive at one location may not be invasive in others; impacts depend on invader abundance and recipient species and conditions. Accounting for these phenomena is essential to accurately understand the patterns of plant invasion and explain the idiosyncratic results reflected in the literature on biological invasions. The lack of community-level richness and the abundance of data spanning broad scales and environmental conditions have until now hindered our understanding of invasions at a macroecological scale. To address this limitation, we leveraged quantitative surveys of plant communities in the USA and integrated and harmonized nine datasets into the Standardized Plant Community with Introduced Status (SPCIS) database. The database contains 14,056 unique taxa identified within 83,391 sampling units, of which 52.6% have at least one introduced species. The SPCIS database includes comparable information on plant species occurrence, abundance, and native status across the 50 U.S. States and Puerto Rico.

39088548,SFC active reconfiguration based on user mobility and resource demand prediction in dynamic IoT-MEC networks.,"To achieve secure, reliable, and scalable traffic delivery, request streams in mobile Internet of Things (IoT) networks supporting Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) typically need to pass through a service function chain (SFC) consisting of an ordered series of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), and then arrive at the target application in the MEC for processing. The high mobility of users and the real-time variability of network traffic in IoT-MEC networks lead to constant changes in the network state, which results in a mismatch between the performance requirements of the currently deployed SFCs and the allocated resources. Meanwhile, there are usually multiple instances of the same VNF in the network, and proactively reconfiguring the deployed SFCs based on the network state changes to ensure high quality of service in the network is a great challenge. In this paper, we study the SFC Reconfiguration Strategy (SFC-RS) based on user mobility and resource demand prediction in IoT MEC networks, aiming to minimize the end-to-end delay and reconfiguration cost of SFCs. First, we model SFC-RS as Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Then, a user trajectory prediction model based on codec movement with attention mechanism and a VNF resource demand prediction model based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network are designed to accurately predict user trajectories and node computational and storage resources, respectively. Based on the prediction results, a Prediction-based SFV Active Reconfiguration (PSAR) algorithm is proposed to achieve seamless SFC migration and routing update before the user experience quality degrades, ensuring network consistency and high quality service. Simulation results show that PSAR provides 51.28%, 28.60%, 21.75%, and 16.80% performance improvement over the existing TSRFCM, DDQ, OSA, and DPSM algorithms in terms of end-to-end delay reduction, and 33.32%, 18.94%, 67.42%, and 60.61% performance optimization in terms of reconfiguration cost reduction.",False,True,,0.6642479,,sfc,16.72460663,ok,,sfc reconfiguration strategy | reconfiguration strategy,sfc-rs | psar | dpsm,v2,0.72460663,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39242194,BANMF-S: a blockwise accelerated non-negative matrix factorization framework with structural network constraints for single cell imputation.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique enables the transcriptome profiling of hundreds to ten thousands of cells at the unprecedented individual level and provides new insights to study cell heterogeneity. However, its advantages are hampered by dropout events. To address this problem, we propose a Blockwise Accelerated Non-negative Matrix Factorization framework with Structural network constraints (BANMF-S) to impute those technical zeros.<h4>Results</h4>BANMF-S constructs a gene-gene similarity network to integrate prior information from the external PPI network by the Triadic Closure Principle and a cell-cell similarity network to capture the neighborhood structure and temporal information through a Minimum-Spanning Tree. By collaboratively employing these two networks as regularizations, BANMF-S encourages the coherence of similar gene and cell pairs in the latent space, enhancing the potential to recover the underlying features. Besides, BANMF-S adopts a blocklization strategy to solve the traditional NMF problem through distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent method in a parallel way to accelerate the optimization. Numerical experiments on simulations and real datasets verify that BANMF-S can improve the accuracy of downstream clustering and pseudo-trajectory inference, and its performance is superior to seven state-of-the-art algorithms.<h4>Availability</h4>All data used in this work are downloaded from publicly available data sources, and their corresponding accession numbers or source URLs are provided in Supplementary File Section 5.1 Dataset Information.

36962988,The World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News: A retrospective database.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) notifies the global community about disease outbreaks through the Disease Outbreak News (DON). These online reports tell important stories about both outbreaks themselves and the high-level decision making that governs information sharing during public health emergencies. However, they have been used only minimally in global health scholarship to date. Here, we collate all 2,789 of these reports from their first use through the start of the Covid-19 pandemic (January 1996 to December 2019), and develop an annotated database of the subjective and often inconsistent information they contain. We find that these reports are dominated by a mix of persistent worldwide threats (particularly influenza and cholera) and persistent epidemics (like Ebola virus disease in Africa or MERS-CoV in the Middle East), but also document important periods in history like the anthrax bioterrorist attacks at the turn of the century, the spread of chikungunya and Zika virus to the Americas, or even recent lapses in progress towards polio elimination.

35397401,A platform for the rapid synthesis of proteolysis targeting chimeras (Rapid-TAC) under miniaturized conditions.,"Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is one of the most frequently used technologies for targeted protein degradation. PROTACs are composed of target protein ligand, E3 ligase ligand and a linker between them. Traditional methods for the development of PROTACs involve step-by-step synthesis and are time consuming. Herein, we report a platform for the rapid synthesis of PROTACs (Rapid-TAC) via a traceless coupling reaction between ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) motif on the ligand of targeting protein and an amine fucntional group on the commercially available partial PROTAC library that is composed of different E3 ligase ligands and various types and lengths of linkers. Under our optimized miniaturized conditions, the full PROTACs can be synthesized in a high throughput manner and the products can be directly used for screening without any further manipulations including purification. We demonstrated the utility of this platform by quickly identifying active degraders for androgen receptor (AR) and BRD4 with DC<sub>50</sub> of 41.9 nM and 8.9 nM, respectively. It is expected that this Rapid-TAC platform can be easily extended to many other targets, thus lowering the barrier to access this novel modelity for small molecule drug discovery and faciliate structure activity relationship studies.",False,True,,0.6739981,proteolysis targeting chimera,,16.71565473,ok,,rapid-tac,protac | apid-t,v2,0.71565473,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

38515052,NanoBERTa-ASP: predicting nanobody paratope based on a pretrained RoBERTa model.,"<h4>Background</h4>Nanobodies, also known as VHH or single-domain antibodies, are unique antibody fragments derived solely from heavy chains. They offer advantages of small molecules and conventional antibodies, making them promising therapeutics. The paratope is the specific region on an antibody that binds to an antigen. Paratope prediction involves the identification and characterization of the antigen-binding site on an antibody. This process is crucial for understanding the specificity and affinity of antibody-antigen interactions. Various computational methods and experimental approaches have been developed to predict and analyze paratopes, contributing to advancements in antibody engineering, drug development, and immunotherapy. However, existing predictive models trained on traditional antibodies may not be suitable for nanobodies. Additionally, the limited availability of nanobody datasets poses challenges in constructing accurate models.<h4>Methods</h4>To address these challenges, we have developed a novel nanobody prediction model, named NanoBERTa-ASP (Antibody Specificity Prediction), which is specifically designed for predicting nanobody-antigen binding sites. The model adopts a training strategy more suitable for nanobodies, based on an advanced natural language processing (NLP) model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). To be more specific, the model utilizes a masked language modeling approach named RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) to learn the contextual information of the nanobody sequence and predict its binding site.<h4>Results</h4>NanoBERTa-ASP achieved exceptional performance in predicting nanobody binding sites, outperforming existing methods, indicating its proficiency in capturing sequence information specific to nanobodies and accurately identifying their binding sites. Furthermore, NanoBERTa-ASP provides insights into the interaction mechanisms between nanobodies and antigens, contributing to a better understanding of nanobodies and facilitating the design and development of nanobodies with therapeutic potential.<h4>Conclusion</h4>NanoBERTa-ASP represents a significant advancement in nanobody paratope prediction. Its superior performance highlights the potential of deep learning approaches in nanobody research. By leveraging the increasing volume of nanobody data, NanoBERTa-ASP can further refine its predictions, enhance its performance, and contribute to the development of novel nanobody-based therapeutics.

BFG has been implemented in Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens (BFG-Y2H). While Y2H requires test protein pairs to localize in the nucleus for reporter reconstruction, dihydrofolate reductase protein-fragment complementation assay (DHFR-PCA) allows proteins to localize in broader subcellular contexts and proves to be largely orthogonal to Y2H. Here, we implemented BFG to DHFR-PCA (BFG-PCA). This plasmid-based system can leverage ORF collections across model organisms to perform comparative analysis, unlike the original DHFR-PCA that requires yeast genomic integration. The scalability and quality of BFG-PCA were demonstrated by screening human and yeast interactions for >11 000 bait-prey pairs. BFG-PCA showed high-sensitivity and high-specificity for capturing known interactions for both species. BFG-Y2H and BFG-PCA capture distinct sets of PPIs, which can partially be explained based on the domain orientation of the reporter tags.

39716522,ACTION: Augmentation and computation toolbox for brain network analysis with functional MRI.,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been increasingly employed to investigate functional brain activity. Many fMRI-related software/toolboxes have been developed, providing specialized algorithms for fMRI analysis. However, existing toolboxes seldom consider fMRI data augmentation, which is quite useful, especially in studies with limited or imbalanced data. Moreover, current studies usually focus on analyzing fMRI using conventional machine learning models that rely on human-engineered fMRI features, without investigating deep learning models that can automatically learn data-driven fMRI representations. In this work, we develop an open-source toolbox, called Augmentation and Computation Toolbox for braIn netwOrk aNalysis (ACTION), offering comprehensive functions to streamline fMRI analysis. The ACTION is a Python-based and cross-platform toolbox with graphical user-friendly interfaces. It enables automatic fMRI augmentation, covering blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal augmentation and brain network augmentation. Many popular methods for brain network construction and network feature extraction are included. In particular, it supports constructing deep learning models, which leverage large-scale auxiliary unlabeled data (3,800+ resting-state fMRI scans) for model pretraining to enhance model performance for downstream tasks. To facilitate multi-site fMRI studies, it is also equipped with several popular federated learning strategies. Furthermore, it enables users to design and test custom algorithms through scripting, greatly improving its utility and extensibility. We demonstrate the effectiveness and user-friendliness of ACTION on real fMRI data and present the experimental results.

35104125,Membrane Mixer: A Toolkit for Efficient Shuffling of Lipids in Heterogeneous Biological Membranes.,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biological membranes have achieved such levels of sophistication that are commonly used to predict unresolved structures and various properties of lipids and to substantiate experimental data. While achieving sufficient sampling of lipid dynamics remains a major challenge, a commonly used method to improve lipid sampling, e.g., in terms of specific interactions with membrane-associated proteins, is to randomize the initial arrangement of lipid constituents in multiple replicas of simulations, without changing the overall lipid composition of the membrane of interest. Here, we introduce a method that can rapidly generate multiple replicas of lipid bilayers with different spatial and conformational configurations for any given lipid composition. The underlying algorithm, which allows one to shuffle lipids at any desired level, relies on the application of an external potential, here referred to as the ""carving potential"", that removes clashes/entanglements before lipid positions are exchanged (shuffled), thereby minimizing the energy penalty due to abrupt lipid repositioning. The method is implemented as ""Membrane Mixer Plugin (MMP) 1.0"" in VMD, with a convenient graphical user interface that guides the user in setting various options and parameters. The plugin is fully automated and generates new membrane replicas more rapidly and conveniently than other analogous tools.

Spectra were used to construct tumor/non-tumor, IDH1WT/IDH1mut, and methylation-subtype classifiers. Support vector machine and random forest were used to identify the most discriminatory Raman frequencies. Stimulated Raman spectroscopy was used to validate the frequencies identified.

It plays a vital role in lead optimization, personalized medication, and ADMET research. The MRD consists of three main components: (i) the sequential catalyses of drug and its metabolites by different drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), (ii) a comprehensive collection of metabolic reactions along the entire MRD and (iii) a systematic description on efficacy & toxicity for all metabolites of a studied drug. However, there is no database available for describing the comprehensive metabolic roadmaps of drugs. Therefore, in this study, a major update of INTEDE was conducted, which provided the stepwise & sequential metabolic roadmaps for a total of 4701 drugs, and a total of 22 165 metabolic reactions containing 1088 DMEs and 18 882 drug metabolites. Additionally, the INTEDE 2.0 labeled the pharmacological properties (pharmacological activity or toxicity) of metabolites and provided their structural information. Furthermore, 3717 drug metabolism relationships were supplemented (from 7338 to 11 055). All in all, INTEDE 2.0 is highly expected to attract broad interests from related research community and serve as an essential supplement to existing pharmaceutical/biological/chemical databases.

It presents ~280,000 human non-coding RNA genes, identified algorithmically from ~690,000 RNAcentral transcripts. This expands by ~tenfold the ncRNA gene count relative to other sources. GeneCaRNA thus contains ~120,000 long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs, >200 bases long), including ~100,000 novel genes. The latter have sparse functional information, a vast terra incognita for future research. LncRNA genes are uniformly represented on all nuclear chromosomes, with 10 genes on mitochondrial DNA. Data obtained from MalaCards, another GeneCards Suite member, finds 1547 genes associated with 1 to 50 diseases. About 15% of the associations portray experimental evidence, with cancers tending to be multigenic. Preliminary text mining within GeneCaRNA discovers interactions of lncRNA transcripts with target gene products, with 25% being ncRNAs and 75% proteins. GeneCaRNA has a biological pathways section, which at present shows 131 pathways for 38 lncRNA genes, a basis for future expansion. Finally, our GeneHancer database provides regulatory elements for ~110,000 lncRNA genes, offering pointers for co-regulated genes and genetic linkages from enhancers to diseases.

To identify and quantify important variants, all genes within a population must be predicted, functionally annotated, and clustered, representing the ""pangenome."" Despite the volume of genome data available, gene prediction and annotation are currently conducted in isolation on individual genomes, which is computationally inefficient and frequently inconsistent across genomes. Here, we introduce the open-source software graph-gene-caller (ggCaller). ggCaller combines gene prediction, functional annotation, and clustering into a single workflow using population-wide de Bruijn graphs, removing redundancy in gene annotation and resulting in more accurate gene predictions and orthologue clustering. We applied ggCaller to simulated and real-world bacterial data sets containing hundreds or thousands of genomes, comparing it to current state-of-the-art tools. ggCaller has considerable speed-ups with equivalent or greater accuracy, particularly with data sets containing complex sources of error, such as assembly contamination or fragmentation. ggCaller is also an important extension to bacterial genome-wide association studies, enabling querying of annotated graphs for functional analyses. We highlight this application by functionally annotating DNA sequences with significant associations to tetracycline and macrolide resistance in <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, identifying key resistance determinants that were missed when using only a single reference genome. ggCaller is a novel bacterial genome analysis tool with applications in bacterial evolution and epidemiology.",False,True,,0.72219574,,aller,16.68612945,ok,,ggcaller,graph | ene,v2,0.68612945,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40257980,Addressing data management and analysis challenges in viral genomics: The Swiss HIV cohort study viral next generation sequencing database.,"Numerous HIV related outcomes can be determined on the viral genome, for example, resistance associated mutations, population transmission dynamics, viral heritability traits, or time since infection. Viral sequences of people with HIV (PWH) are therefore essential for therapeutic and research purposes. While in the first three decades of the HIV pandemic viral genomes were mainly sequenced using Sanger sequencing, the last decade has seen a shift towards next-generation sequencing (NGS) as the preferred method. NGS can achieve near full length genome sequence coverage and simultaneously, it accurately encapsulates the within-host diversity by characterizing HIV subpopulations. NGS opens new avenues for HIV research, but it also presents challenges concerning data management and analysis. We therefore set up the Swiss HIV Cohort Study Viral NGS Database (SHCND) to address key issues in the handling of NGS data including high loads of raw- and processed NGS data, data storage solutions, downstream application of sophisticated bioinformatic tools, high-performance computing resources, and reproducibility. The database is nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Zurich Primary HIV Infection Cohort Study (ZPHI), which together enrolled 21,876 PWH since 1988 and include a biobank dating back to the early nineties. Since its initiation in 2018, the SHCND accumulated NGS sequences (plasma and proviral origin) of 5,178 unique PWH. We here describe the design, set-up, and use of this NGS database.

36913423,An Efficient Hybrid Job Scheduling Optimization (EHJSO) approach to enhance resource search using Cuckoo and Grey Wolf Job Optimization for cloud environment.,"Cloud computing has now evolved as an unavoidable technology in the fields of finance, education, internet business, and nearly all organisations. The cloud resources are practically accessible to cloud users over the internet to accomplish the desired task of the cloud users. The effectiveness and efficacy of cloud computing services depend on the tasks that the cloud users submit and the time taken to complete the task as well. By optimising resource allocation and utilisation, task scheduling is crucial to enhancing the effectiveness and performance of a cloud system. In this context, cloud computing offers a wide range of advantages, such as cost savings, security, flexibility, mobility, quality control, disaster recovery, automatic software upgrades, and sustainability. According to a recent research survey, more and more tech-savvy companies and industry executives are recognize and utilize the advantages of the Cloud computing. Hence, as the number of users of the Cloud increases, so did the need to regulate the resource allocation as well. However, the scheduling of jobs in the cloud necessitates a smart and fast algorithm that can discover the resources that are accessible and schedule the jobs that are requested by different users. Consequently, for better resource allocation and job scheduling, a fast, efficient, tolerable job scheduling algorithm is required. Efficient Hybrid Job Scheduling Optimization (EHJSO) utilises Cuckoo Search Optimization and Grey Wolf Job Optimization (GWO). Due to some cuckoo species' obligate brood parasitism (laying eggs in other species' nests), the Cuckoo search optimization approach was developed. Grey wolf optimization (GWO) is a population-oriented AI system inspired by grey wolf social structure and hunting strategies. Make span, computation time, fitness, iteration-based performance, and success rate were utilised to compare previous studies.

However, there is a growing need for a comparative epigenome browser that can display genomic and epigenomic data sets across different species and enable users to compare them between syntenic regions. Here, we present the WashU Comparative Epigenome Browser. It allows users to load functional genomic data sets/annotations mapped to different genomes and display them over syntenic regions simultaneously. The browser also displays genetic differences between the genomes from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to structural variants (SVs) to visualize the association between epigenomic differences and genetic differences. Instead of anchoring all data sets to the reference genome coordinates, it creates independent coordinates of different genome assemblies to faithfully present features and data mapped to different genomes. It uses a simple, intuitive genome-align track to illustrate the syntenic relationship between different species. It extends the widely used WashU Epigenome Browser infrastructure and can be expanded to support multiple species.

On one hand, the validated data in an organization helps in recruiting legitimate skillful employees; on the other hand, keeping the employee's data safe and maintaining privacy laws such as compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is also an organization's responsibility. Besides, transparency in human resource management operations is crucial because it promotes trust and fairness within an organization. The present HRM systems are centralized in nature and their verifiable credential system is ineffective; this leads to the intentions of internal data sabotage or internal threats. Besides, the organizations' biases also become more prominent. In this paper, we address the above-mentioned problems with a blockchain framework for HRM to utilize the privacy of data access through a Privacy Information Retrieval (PIR) process. To be specific, our proposed framework called <i>Blockchained piR of resOurces as humaN (BRON)</i>, is the first blockchain framework to show an effective mechanism to access data from organizations globally without hampering privacy. BRON uses a generalized user registration process to use the services of data access and in the background, it uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for global verification and PIR for privacy-based data retrieval. More specifically, credential verification and ZKP-based PIR are the highlights of our proposed BRON. Another interesting aspect of BRON is the use of Proof-of-Authority (PoA) to validate the anonymity and unlinkability of any HR operation. Finally, BRON has also contributed with a smart contract to incentivize the employees. BRON is very generic and easily be customizable as per the HR requirements. We run a set of experiments on BRON and observe that it is successful in providing privacy-assured data access and decentralized human resource data management. Overall, BRON provides 30% reduced latency and 35% better throughput as compared to the existing blockchain solutions in the direction of HRM.",False,True,,0.6503133,,i,16.65984803,ok,,,bron | gdpr,v2,0.65984803,BRON,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39774953,Deep learning based approaches for intelligent industrial machinery health management and fault diagnosis in resource-constrained environments.,"Industry 4.0 represents the fourth industrial revolution, which is characterized by the incorporation of digital technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, big data, and other advanced technologies into industrial processes. Industrial Machinery Health Management (IMHM) is a crucial element, based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which focuses on monitoring the health and condition of industrial machinery. The academic community has focused on various aspects of IMHM, such as prognostic maintenance, condition monitoring, estimation of remaining useful life (RUL), intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD), and architectures based on edge computing. Each of these categories holds its own significance in the context of industrial processes. In this survey, we specifically examine the research on RUL prediction, edge-based architectures, and intelligent fault diagnosis, with a primary focus on the domain of intelligent fault diagnosis. The importance of IFD methods in ensuring the smooth execution of industrial processes has become increasingly evident. However, most methods are formulated under the assumption of complete, balanced, and abundant data, which often does not align with real-world engineering scenarios. The difficulties linked to these classifications of IMHM have received noteworthy attention from the research community, leading to a substantial number of published papers on the topic. While there are existing comprehensive reviews that address major challenges and limitations in this field, there is still a gap in thoroughly investigating research perspectives across RUL prediction, edge-based architectures, and complete intelligent fault diagnosis processes. To fill this gap, we undertake a comprehensive survey that reviews and discusses research achievements in this domain, specifically focusing on IFD. Initially, we classify the existing IFD methods into three distinct perspectives: the method of processing data, which aims to optimize inputs for the intelligent fault diagnosis model and mitigate limitations in the training sample set; the method of constructing the model, which involves designing the structure and features of the model to enhance its resilience to challenges; and the method of optimizing training, which focuses on refining the training process for intelligent fault diagnosis models and emphasizes the importance of ideal data in the training process. Subsequently, the survey covers techniques related to RUL prediction and edge-cloud architectures for resource-constrained environments. Finally, this survey consolidates the outlook on relevant issues in IMHM, explores potential solutions, and offers practical recommendations for further consideration.",False,True,,0.6775965,machinery,,16.65701425,ok,,machinery health management,imhm | iiot,v2,0.65701425,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To develop strategies for infection control, it is necessary to understand the biology and pathogenesis of this pathogen. Investigating the evolutionary mechanisms behind the host-specific adaptation is vital, and comparative genomic analysis can help with this. To facilitate genomic analysis, an online bioinformatics tool called <i>P. insidiosum</i> (Pins) Gene Table v2.0 was developed. This tool includes genomic data from 37 genetically diverse <i>P. insidiosum</i> strains and four related species. The database contains 732,686 genes, grouped into 80,061 unique clusters and further divided into core and variable categories at genus, species, and genotype levels. A high-resolution phylogenomic relationship among <i>P. insidiosum</i> strains and other oomycetes was projected through hierarchical clustering and core gene analyses. 3156 <i>P. insidiosum</i>-specific genes were shared among all genotypes and may be responsible for causing disease in humans and animals. After comparing these species-specific genes to the MvirDB database, 112 had significant matches with 66 known virulence proteins, some of which might be involved in vascular occlusion, which is a pathological feature of pythiosis. The correlation of genotypes, geographic origins, and affected hosts of <i>P. insidiosum</i> suggests that clade-I strains are more specific to animals, while clade-II/III strains are more specific to humans. The clade-specific genes might link to host preference. In summary, Pins Gene Table v2.0 is a comprehensive genome database accessible to users with minimal bioinformatics experience for the analysis of <i>P. insidiosum</i> genomes.",False,True,,0.67899436,,pins,16.656583400000002,ok,,,mvirdb | table | ins,v2,0.6565834,Pins Gene Table,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Based on the fact that fine-grained concepts can be learned with very few samples, only a small number of labeled samples (for example, three) are used for each category. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing the subtle differences between fine-grained images, this paper proposes a method based on spatial frequency information feature fusion for small dataset fine-grained image classification (SDFGIC). This method not only considers the differences in features between the spatial and frequency domains of the images but also incorporates an image processing stage where the images are rotated multiple times. Since the convolutional kernel extracts features of a certain area in the image through translation and convolution operations, multiple rotations can obtain the feature representations of the images in different directions. Finally, learnable parameters are set to fuse the spatial and frequency domain features, and classification is performed through the fully connected layer. According to the mini-batch settings, the experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than other advanced algorithms in experiments on six small datasets.",False,True,,0.66562015,dataset fine,,16.6554972,ok,,,rained | sdfgic,v2,0.6554972,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Among the various computational tools developed in this field, the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) stands out as a widely adopted and highly versatile platform for performing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. VASP is widely used to explore electronic structures, phonon behavior, magnetic properties, thermodynamics and catalytic mechanisms across a diverse range of materials systems. Despite its robust capabilities, utilizing VASP requires expertise in setting up simulations and analyzing results, which can be time consuming and technically challenging. To address these barriers, VASPKIT was developed as a comprehensive toolkit to simplify the workflow for VASP users. VASPKIT streamlines both preprocessing and postprocessing tasks, enabling users to generate essential input files based on customizable parameters and automate computational workflows. The postprocessing features of VASPKIT allow for efficient analysis of electronic, mechanical, optical and catalytic properties, thereby substantially reducing the need for advanced programming expertise. This protocol provides a detailed guide to using VASPKIT, including practical examples to demonstrate its versatility and utility in conducting and analyzing DFT calculations. For instance, the computation of elastic constants, electronic band structures and density of states for a graphene system can typically be completed within half an hour, depending on the computational resources available.

With a view to facilitating research by improving access to genetically diverse material, SCAN was built from legacy research collections of schistosomiasis-related specimens amassed over decades, with more recent collections made through partnership with large field-based projects.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified the literature associated with SCAN from 2012 until 2024, using both database searches (search terms: SCAN, the schistosomiasis collection at the NHM and schistosomiasis) and citations of the publication which originally laid out the scope of the SCAN Collection. Studies were included if the SCAN publication was cited, and/or if the SCAN Collection was utilised in the work. Data extracted included year of publication, authors, whether and how SCAN was used in the work, and type of specimens used.<h4>Results</h4>The literature includes 88 published works, demonstrating the utility of large field-based collections in supporting research. The collection comprises around half a million larval schistosomes originating from the field, with approximately 3000 specimen lots of lab-passaged adult parasites stored in liquid nitrogen. The Collection includes 11 schistosome species, the majority being the human pathogens Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni, while also including many livestock-associated species. Genome analysis of S. haematobium and S. guineensis samples indicate historical introgression or ongoing hybridisation.

Initially, a pretraining method for feature extraction is employed to enhance the semantic expressions of emotions in text by extracting contextual semantic information from emojis. Following this, a sentiment- and emoji-masked language model is designed to prioritize the masking of emojis and words with implicit sentiments, focusing on learning the emotional semantics contained in text. Additionally, we proposed a multifeature fusion method based on a cross-attention mechanism by determining the importance of each word in a text from a topic perspective. Next, this method is integrated with the original semantic information of emojis and the enhanced text features, attaining improved sentiment representation accuracy for short texts.

Key issues include the inability of researchers to effectively query diverse data outputs and to identify potentially important synergies between discipline-specific data. Equally problematic, few semantic ontologies exist to better support data organisation and discovery. Finally, while interdisciplinary research is widely regarded as beneficial to unpacking complex problems, non-researchers such as policy-makers and planners often struggle to use and interrogate the related datasets. To address these issues, the following article details the design and development of the UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub (AASH)'s All-Hub Data Repository (AHDR).<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The AHDR is a single application, single authentication web-based platform comprising a data warehouse to store data from across the AASH's three study countries and to support data querying. Four novel components of the AHDR are described in the following article: (1) a unique data discovery tool; (2) a metadata catalogue that provides researchers with an interface to explore the AASH's data outputs and engage with a new semantic ontology related to child stunting; (3) an interdisciplinary aid to support a directed approach to identifying synergies and interactions between AASH data and (4) a decision support tool that will support non-researchers in engaging with the wider evidence-based outputs of the AASH.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethical approval for this study was granted by institutional ethics committees in the UK, India, Indonesia and Senegal. Results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals; presentations at international conferences and community-level public engagement events; key stakeholder meetings; and in public repositories with appropriate Creative Commons licences allowing for the widest possible use.",False,True,,0.6408123,data repository,,16.633936900000002,ok,,ahdr).<h4,gcrf | ahdr,v2,0.6339369,Developing a data repository to support interdisciplinary research into childhood stunting,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
38271343,Exploring NCATS in-house biomedical data for evidence-based drug repurposing.,"Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses of approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication. Even though many repurposed drugs have been found serendipitously in the past, the increasing availability of large volumes of biomedical data has enabled more systemic, data-driven approaches for drug candidate identification. At National Center of Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), we invent new methods to generate new data and information publicly available to spur innovation and scientific discovery. In this study, we aimed to explore and demonstrate biomedical data generated and collected via two NCATS research programs, the Toxicology in the 21st Century program (Tox21) and the Biomedical Data Translator (Translator) for the application of drug repurposing. These two programs provide complementary types of biomedical data from uncovering underlying biological mechanisms with bioassay screening data from Tox21 for chemical clustering, to enrich clustered chemicals with scientific evidence mined from the Translator towards drug repurposing. 129 chemical clusters have been generated and three of them have been further investigated for drug repurposing candidate identification, which is detailed as case studies.",False,True,,0.6629231,,ncats,16.629597,ok,,,,v2,0.629597,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

37553584,CryoGrid-PIXUL-RNA: high throughput RNA isolation platform for tissue transcript analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Disease molecular complexity requires high throughput workflows to map disease pathways through analysis of vast tissue repositories. Great progress has been made in tissue multiomics analytical technologies. To match the high throughput of these advanced analytical platforms, we have previously developed a multipurpose 96-well microplate sonicator, PIXUL, that can be used in multiple workflows to extract analytes from cultured cells and tissue fragments for various downstream molecular assays. And yet, the sample preparation devices, such as PIXUL, along with the downstream multiomics analytical capabilities have not been fully exploited to interrogate tissues because storing and sampling of such biospecimens remain, in comparison, inefficient.<h4>Results</h4>To mitigate this tissue interrogation bottleneck, we have developed a low-cost user-friendly system, CryoGrid, to catalog, cryostore and sample tissue fragments. TRIzol is widely used to isolate RNA but it is labor-intensive, hazardous, requires fume-hoods, and is an expensive reagent. Columns are also commonly used to extract RNA but they involve many steps, are prone to human errors, and are also expensive. Both TRIzol and column protocols use test tubes. We developed a microplate PIXUL-based TRIzol-free and column-free RNA isolation protocol that uses a buffer containing proteinase K (PK buffer). We have integrated the CryoGrid system with PIXUL-based PK buffer, TRIzol, and PureLink column methods to isolate RNA for gene-specific qPCR and genome-wide transcript analyses. CryoGrid-PIXUL, when integrated with either PK buffer, TRIzol or PureLink column RNA isolation protocols, yielded similar transcript profiles in frozen organs (brain, heart, kidney and liver) from a mouse model of sepsis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RNA isolation using the CryoGrid-PIXUL system combined with the 96-well microplate PK buffer method offers an inexpensive user-friendly high throughput workflow to study transcriptional responses in tissues in health and disease as well as in therapeutic interventions.",False,True,,0.68375486,,ixul,16.6281787,ok,,cryogrid,pixul | trizol,v2,0.6281787,CryoGrid-PIXUL-RNA,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In this paper, we first review the history of rating systems used to evaluate AI mental health interventions. We then describe the recently introduced Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health), whose scoring system allows users to grade AI mental health platforms on key domains, including credibility, user experience, crisis management, user agency, health equity, and transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the use of FAITA-Mental Health scale by systematically applying it to OCD Coach, a generative AI tool readily available on the ChatGPT store and designed to help manage the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results offer insights into the utility and limitations of FAITA-Mental Health when applied to ""real-world"" generative AI platforms in the mental health space, suggesting that the framework effectively identifies key strengths and gaps in AI-driven mental health tools, particularly in areas such as credibility, user experience, and acute crisis management.

35179286,All-in-one: a robust fluorescent fusion protein vector toolbox for protein localization and BiFC analyses in plants.,"Fluorescent tagging protein localization (FTPL) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) are popular tools for in vivo analyses of the subcellular localizations of proteins and protein-protein interactions in plant cells. The efficiency of fluorescent fusion protein (FFP) expression analyses is typically impaired when the FFP genes are co-transformed on separate plasmids compared to when all are cloned and transformed in a single vector. Functional genomics applications using FFPs such as a gene family studies also often require the generation of multiple plasmids. Here, to address these needs, we developed an efficient, modular all-in-one (Aio) FFP (AioFFP) vector toolbox, including a set of fluorescently labelled organelle markers, FTPL and BiFC plasmids and associated binary vectors. This toolbox uses Gibson assembly (GA) and incorporates multiple unique nucleotide sequences (UNSs) to facilitate efficient gene cloning. In brief, this system enables convenient cloning of a target gene into various FFP vectors or the insertion of two or more target genes into the same FFP vector in a single-tube GA reaction. This system also enables integration of organelle marker genes or fluorescently fused target gene expression units into a single transient expression plasmid or binary vector. We validated the AioFFP system by testing genes encoding proteins known to be functional in FTPL and BiFC assays. In addition, we performed a high-throughput assessment of the accurate subcellular localizations of an uncharacterized rice CBSX protein subfamily.

Latency, bandwidth constraints, and scalability problems are the problems that conventional centralized processing architectures encounter. In addition, optimizing for robust communication between ground stations and UAVs while protecting data privacy and security is a daunting task in and of itself. Employing edge computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence-driven decision-making, and dynamic task offloading mechanisms, this research proposes the dynamic task offloading edge-aware optimization framework (DTOE-AOF) for UAV operations optimization. Edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms integrate to decrease latency, increase mission efficiency, and conserve onboard resources. This system dynamically assigns computing duties to edge nodes and UAVs according to proximity, available resources, and the urgency of the tasks.

The beam parameters available at PITZ are worldwide unique. They are based on experiences from 20 + years of developing high brightness beam sources and an ultra-intensive THz light source demonstrator for ps scale electron bunches with up to 5 nC bunch charge at MHz repetition rate in bunch trains of up to 1 ms length, currently 22 MeV (upgrade to 250 MeV planned). Individual bunches can provide peak dose rates up to 10<sup>14</sup> Gy/s, and 10 Gy can be delivered within picoseconds. Upon demand, each bunch of the bunch train can be guided to a different transverse location, so that either a ""painting"" with micro beams (comparable to pencil beam scanning in proton therapy) or a cumulative increase of absorbed dose, using a wide beam distribution, can be realized at the tumor. Full tumor treatment can hence be completed within 1 ms, mitigating organ movement issues.

Deep learning (DL) has been adopted to predict the changes of PPB binding affinities upon mutations, but there was a scarcity of studies predicting the PPB affinity itself. The major reason is the paucity of open-source dataset with PPB affinity data. To address this gap, the current study introduced a large comprehensive PPB affinity (PPB-Affinity) dataset. The PPB-Affinity dataset contains key information such as crystal structures of protein-protein complexes (with or without protein mutation patterns), PPB affinity, receptor protein chain, ligand protein chain, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest publicly available PPB affinity dataset, and we believe it will significantly advance drug discovery by streamlining the screening of potential large-molecule drugs.

40216924,A lightweight large receptive field network LrfSR for image super-resolution.,"Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated excellent performance in the field of single-image super-resolution (SISR) reconstruction. However, existing methods often suffer from issues such as large number of parameters, intensive computation, and high latency, which limit the application of deep convolutional neural networks on devices with low computational resources. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight large receptive field network for image super-resolution (LrfSR). The innovations of this paper mainly include the following aspects. Firstly, we design an information distillation module based on large receptive field (LrfDM). The module achieves large receptive field by dilated convolution, and the enlarged receptive field facilitates the network to capture more pixel-to-pixel relationships and fuse multi-scale information in the feature distillation stage. This design effectively extracts the high-frequency features of the image, which can be demonstrated by the feature map. Secondly, a more efficient attention mechanism is introduced into the network, designed as ECCA and SESA, respectively, which achieves an improvement in super-resolution image quality with fewer network parameters. Experiments on Set5, Set14, B100, Urban100 and Manga109 datasets show that the LrfSR model achieves 4-fold super-resolution Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values of 32.23 dB, 28.65 dB, 27.59 dB, 26.36 dB and 30.53 dB, which is better than the existing model LKDN etc. Meanwhile, both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the LrfSR model explores the potential of large receptive fields in lightweight image super-resolution networks and successfully achieves a balance between high-quality image reconstruction and limited resources.

37715446,Single-cell transcriptome analysis dissects lncRNA-associated gene networks in Arabidopsis.,"The plant genome produces an extremely large collection of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are generally expressed in a context-specific manner and have pivotal roles in regulation of diverse biological processes. Here, we mapped the transcriptional heterogeneity of lncRNAs and their associated gene regulatory networks at single-cell resolution. We generated a comprehensive cell atlas at the whole-organism level by integrative analysis of 28 published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from juvenile Arabidopsis seedlings. We then provided an in-depth analysis of cell-type-related lncRNA signatures that show expression patterns consistent with canonical protein-coding gene markers. We further demonstrated that the cell-type-specific expression of lncRNAs largely explains their tissue specificity.

This study proposes a semantic union model (SUM), which concatenates candidate entities and candidate relationships, using a contrastive learning algorithm to learn the semantic vector representation of question and candidate entity-relation pairs, and perform cosine similarity calculations to simultaneously complete entity disambiguation and relation matching tasks. It can provide information for entity disambiguation through the relationships between entities, avoid error propagation, and improve the system performance.

39546454,MaskDGNets: Masked-attention guided dynamic graph aggregation network for event extraction.,"Considering that the traditional deep learning event extraction method ignores the correlation between word features and sequence information, it cannot fully explore the hidden associations between events and events and between events and primary attributes. To solve these problems, we developed a new framework for event extraction called the masked attention-guided dynamic graph aggregation network. On the one hand, to obtain effective word representation and sequence representation, an interaction and complementary relationship are established between word vectors and character vectors. At the same time, a squeeze layer is introduced in the bidirectional independent recurrent unit to model the sentence sequence from both positive and negative directions while retaining the local spatial details to the maximum extent and establishing practical long-term dependencies and rich global context representations. On the other hand, the designed masked attention mechanism can effectively balance the word vector features and sequence semantics and refine these features. The designed dynamic graph aggregation module establishes effective connections between events and events, and between events and essential attributes, strengthens the interactivity and association between them, and realizes feature transfer and aggregation on graph nodes in the neighborhood through dynamic strategies to improve the performance of event extraction. We designed a reconstructed weighted loss function to supervise and adjust each module individually to ensure the optimal feature representation. Finally, the proposed MaskDGNets framework is evaluated on two baseline datasets, DuEE and CCKS2020. It demonstrates its robustness and event extraction performance, with F1 of 81.443% and 87.382%, respectively.",False,True,,0.6752893,network,,16.5997226,ok,,maskdgnets,guided,v2,0.5997226,MaskDGNets,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Spain is one of the main producers and exporters of this crop in the Mediterranean Basin, but in order to maintain the competitiveness of this crop, new varieties should be developed. For this purpose, the pomegranate germplasm collection hold at the Agricultural Experiment Station of Elche, a public institution dependent on the Valencian regional government, is an interesting tool. However, the detailed characterization of any germplasm collection is a fundamental requirement to be able to make the most of these resources, allowing to identify putative promising accessions and to optimize the design of the future crosses. In this work, the genetic diversity of 94 accessions of this collection was analyzed using 19 microsatellite markers. As a result, 85 different genotypes were identified. These genetic profiles could be useful for varietal identification. Despite this genetic diversity, no clear substructure was observed, except for the ornamental accessions, that could be related to the vegetative propagation of the species. Additionally, the morphological characterization of this collection has made it possible to identify some materials that may be of interest as a source of traits for breeding.

39033920,Rapid selection of milk mid-infrared spectra for creating a dairy cow population world representative spectral database.,"The advantage of employing mid-infrared spectrometry for milk analysis in breeding lies in its ability to quickly generate millions of records. However, these records may be biased if the calibration process does not account for their spectral variability when constructing the predictive model. Therefore, this study introduces a novel method for developing a world representative spectral database (WRSD) to reduce the risks of spectral extrapolation when predicting dairy traits in new samples. Using a 2-phase selection procedure that is both efficient and minimizes memory usage, we first generate a decomposition matrix via principal component analysis (PCA) on a dataset of 2,324,443 records. The next phase iterates spectral selection based on a location index from PCA scores, calculating spectra occurrence frequency for refined barycenter estimations. The chosen spectra's barycenter closely aligns with the entire dataset, proving the efficacy of using just 3 principal components. Applied to 4 varied datasets totaling over 21 million records, we select 583,440 spectra to represent spectral diversity, with selection rates between 2.00% and 14.88%. This selection illustrates the spectral variability across different dairy populations and data providers. Demonstrated through a hypothetical calibration set of 71 samples, the WRSD's utility for algorithm developers becomes apparent. This calibration set covers between 91.42% and 98.50% of the WRSD variability, except for the Irish dataset (3.50%), indicating a need for additional samples to accurately represent Irish variability and minimize spectral extrapolation. This study offers valuable insights into the representativeness of training sets for capturing spectral variability within targeted dairy populations. Although the current WRSD does not fully encompass global milk spectral diversity, its development underscores the importance of gathering more data and standardizing spectral information across spectrometer brands. Ultimately, the WRSD proves crucial not just for trait prediction but also for identifying abnormal milk samples, also marking a significant relevance in dairy science technology.",False,True,,0.6696093,spectral database,,16.5900569,ok,,,wrsd,v2,0.5900569,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Despite rickettsiae posing an emerging global health risk, the genetic requirements of their infectious life cycles remain poorly understood. A major hurdle toward building this understanding has been the lack of efficient tools for genetic manipulation, owing to the technical difficulties associated with their obligate intracellular nature. To this end, we implemented the Tet-On system to enable conditional gene expression in <i>Rickettsia parkeri</i>. Using Tet-On, we show inducible expression of antibiotic resistance and a fluorescent reporter. We further used this inducible promoter to screen the ability of <i>R. parkeri</i> to express four variants of the catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9). We demonstrate that all four dCas9 variants can be expressed in <i>R. parkeri</i> and used for CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated targeted gene knockdown. We show targeted knockdown of an antibiotic resistance gene as well as the endogenous virulence factor <i>sca2</i>. Altogether, we have developed systems for inducible gene expression and CRISPRi-mediated gene knockdown for the first time in rickettsiae, laying the groundwork for more scalable, targeted mechanistic investigations into their infectious life cycles.IMPORTANCEThe spotted fever group of <i>Rickettsia</i> contains vector-borne pathogenic bacteria that are neglected and emerging threats to public health. Due to the obligate intracellular nature of rickettsiae, the development of tools for genetic manipulation has been stunted, and the molecular and genetic underpinnings of their infectious lifecycle remain poorly understood. Here, we expand the genetic toolkit by introducing systems for conditional gene expression and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated gene knockdown. These systems allow for relatively easy manipulation of rickettsial gene expression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools by disrupting the intracellular life cycle using CRISPRi to deplete the <i>sca2</i> virulence factor.

36598498,CSD Communications of the Cambridge Structural Database.,"The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) is a collection of over one million experimental three-dimensional structures obtained through crystallographic analyses. These structures are determined by crystallographers worldwide and undergo curation and enhancement by scientists at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) prior to their addition to the database. Though the CSD is substantial and contains widespread chemical diversity across organic and metal-organic compounds, it is estimated that a significant proportion of crystal structures determined are not published or shared through the peer-reviewed journal mechanism. To help overcome this, scientists can publish structures directly through the database as CSD Communications and these structural datasets are made publicly available alongside structures associated with scientific articles. CSD Communications contribute to the collective crystallographic knowledge as nearly two thirds are novel structures that are not otherwise available in the scientific literature. The primary benefits of sharing data through CSD Communications include the long-term preservation of scientific data, the strengthening of a widely data-mined world repository (the CSD), and the opportunity for scientists to receive recognition for their work through a formal and citable data publication.

Over the last ten years, much ecological research has been carried out on bees, often generating a large volume of specimens and increasing the importance of entomological collections. Here, we present the bee collection of the IMBE laboratory (Marseille, France) after ten years of study of plant-pollinator networks.<h4>New information</h4>We provide distribution data on 2181 specimens belonging to 246 species of bees, mainly from the Mediterranean Region of France. One of the recorded species, <i>Lasioglossumsoror</i>, is classified as ""endangered"" at the European level, while 68 of the recorded species are currently Data Deficient according to the 2014 Red List of European bees. This dataset contributes to the broader effort to enhance the knowledge of French bee diversity.

38314123,Towards a Canary Islands barcode database for soil biodiversity: revealing cryptic and unrecorded mite species diversity within insular soils.,"Soil arthropod diversity contributes to a high proportion of the total biodiversity on Earth. However, most soil arthropods are still undescribed, hindering our understanding of soil functioning and global biodiversity estimations. Inventorying soil arthropods using conventional taxonomical approaches is particularly difficult and costly due to the great species richness, abundance and local-scale heterogeneity of mesofauna communities and the poor taxonomic background knowledge of most lineages. To alleviate this situation, we have designed and implemented a molecular barcoding framework adapted to soil fauna. This pipeline includes different steps, starting with a morphology-based selection of specimens which are imaged. Then, DNA is extracted non-destructively. Both images and voucher specimens are used to assign a taxonomic identification, based on morphology that is further checked for consistency with molecular information. Using this procedure, we studied 239 specimens of mites from the Canary Islands including representatives of Mesostigmata, Sarcoptiformes and Trombidiformes, of which we recovered barcode sequences for 168 specimens that were morphologically identified to 49 species, with nine specimens that could only be identified at the genus or family levels. Multiple species delimitation analyses were run to compare molecular delimitations with morphological identifications, including ASAP, mlPTP, BINs and 3% and 8% genetic distance thresholds. Additionally, a species-level search was carried out at the Biodiversity Databank of the Canary Islands (BIOTA) to evaluate the number of species in our dataset that were not previously recorded in the archipelago. In parallel, a sequence-level search of our sequences was performed against BOLD Systems. Our results reveal that multiple morphologically identified species correspond to different molecular lineages, which points to significant levels of unknown cryptic diversity within the archipelago. In addition, we evidenced that multiple species in our dataset constituted new records for the Canary Islands fauna and that the information for these lineages within online genetic repositories is very incomplete. Our study represents the first systematic effort to catalogue the soil arthropod mesofauna of the Canary Islands and establishes the basis for the Canary Islands Soil Biodiversity barcode database.

This work addresses these challenges by developing an interactive toolkit that leverages insights from 7 leading cancer research projects (Integration of Heterogeneous Data and Evidence towards Regulatory and HTA Acceptance [IDERHA], European Federation for Cancer Images [EUCAIM], Artificial intelligence Supporting Cancer Patients across Europe [ASCAPE], Personalised Health Monitoring and Decision Support Based On Artificial Intelligence and Holistic Health Records [iHelp], Central repository for digital pathology [Bigpicture], Piloting an infrastructure for the secondary use of health data [HealthData@EU] pilot, and improving cancer diagnosis and prediction with AI and big data [INCISIVE]) to guide in shaping the EHDS2 interoperability framework. Building upon the foundations laid by the Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) joint action (JA) and the new European Interoperability Framework (EIF), the toolkit incorporates several key innovative features. First, it provides interactive and user-friendly entry modules to support European projects in creating their own interoperability frameworks aligned with the evolving EHDS2 requirements technical and governance requirements. Second, it guides projects in navigating the complex landscape of health data standards, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to implementing the EHDS2 recommended standards for data discoverability and sharing. Third, the toolkit fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among projects by enabling them to share their experiences and best practices in implementing standards and addressing interoperability challenges. Finally, the toolkit recognizes the dynamic nature of the EHDS2 and the evolving regulatory landscape, including the impact of AI regulations and related standards. This allows for continuous adaptation and improvement, ensuring the toolkit remains relevant and useful for future projects.

Despite the availability of SWCC datasets in the literature, significant efforts are required to harmonize reported data before SWCC parameters can be determined and implemented in modeling applications. In this work, a total of 15,259 SWCCs from 2,702 sites were assembled from published literature, harmonized, and quality-checked. The assembled SWCC data provide a global soil hydraulic properties (GSHP) database. Parameters of the van Genuchten (vG) SWCC model were estimated from the data using the R package 'soilhypfit'. In many cases, information on the wet- or dry-end of the SWCC measurements were missing, and we used pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to estimate saturated and residual water contents.

This allows us to examine the tendency of different sub-regions of the gene to be more or less prone to mutations when compared with other sub-regions. We do this by recording the number of occurrences of close to 1100 mutations resulting from 9 different mutagens or mutators at each site within a rolling 20-site interval. We can define 5 mutationally prone regions (MPRs). Aligning the profile of MPRs in tdk next to those we previously described in the thyA gene results in a linear map with 8 MPR regions, reinforcing the concept that certain sub-regions of genes are more mutable than others, even when other variables are accounted for.

Elucidating the mechanism that underlies such control through the regulation of stomatal opening/closing is important to understand how plants regulate photosynthesis and tolerate against drought. However, up-to-date, molecular components and their function involved in stomatal regulation are not fully understood. We challenged such problem through a chemical genetic approach by isolating and characterizing synthetic molecules that influence stomatal movement. Here, we describe that a small chemical collection, prepared during the development of C-H amination reactions, lead to the discovery of a Stomata Influencing Molecule (SIM); namely, a sulfonimidated oxazole that inhibits stomatal opening. The starting molecule SIM1 was initially isolated from screening of compounds that inhibit light induced opening of dayflower stomata. A range of SIM molecules were rapidly accessed using our state-of-the-art C-H amination technologies. This enabled an efficient structure-activity relationship (SAR) study, culminating in the discovery of a sulfonamidated oxazole derivative (SIM*) having higher activity and enhanced specificity against stomatal regulation. Biological assay results have shed some light on the mode of action of SIM molecules within the cell, which may ultimately lead to drought tolerance-conferring agrochemicals through the control of stomatal movement.",False,True,,0.6378606,molecule,,16.56420124,ok,,,c-h,v2,0.56420124,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Efficient lesion segmentation can speed up these radiological workflows. While numerous benchmarks and challenges address lesion segmentation in specific organs like the liver, kidneys, and lungs, the larger variety of lesion types encountered in clinical practice demands a more universal approach. To address this gap, we introduced the ULS23 benchmark for 3D universal lesion segmentation in chest-abdomen-pelvis CT examinations. The ULS23 training dataset contains 38,693 lesions across this region, including challenging pancreatic, colon and bone lesions. For evaluation purposes, we curated a dataset comprising 775 lesions from 284 patients. Each of these lesions was identified as a target lesion in a clinical context, ensuring diversity and clinical relevance within this dataset. The ULS23 benchmark is publicly accessible at https://uls23.grand-challenge.org, enabling researchers worldwide to assess the performance of their segmentation methods. Furthermore, we have developed and publicly released our baseline semi-supervised 3D lesion segmentation model.

The BTB is built on a multidisciplinary network established to provide the scientific community with standardized biospecimens and genomic data, thereby improving knowledge of the biology, treatment and outcome of childhood tumors. As of 2022, over 1100 fresh-frozen tumor samples are available for researchers. We present the workflow of the BTB from sample collection and processing to the generation of genomic data and services offered. To determine the research and clinical utility of the data, we performed bioinformatics analyses on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data obtained from a subset of 82 brain tumors and patient blood-derived DNA combined with methylation profiling to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and identified germline and somatic alterations with potential biological or clinical significance. The BTB procedures for collection, processing, sequencing, and bioinformatics deliver high-quality data. We observed that the findings could impact patient management by confirming or clarifying the diagnosis in 79 of the 82 tumors and detecting known or likely driver mutations in 68 of 79 patients. In addition to revealing known mutations in a broad spectrum of genes implicated in pediatric cancer, we discovered numerous alterations that may represent novel driver events and specific tumor entities. In summary, these examples reveal the power of NGS to identify a wide number of actionable gene alterations. Making the power of NGS available in healthcare is a challenging task requiring the integration of the work of clinical specialists and cancer biologists; this approach requires a dedicated infrastructure, as exemplified here by the BTB.",False,True,,0.64690846,biobank,,16.559295300000002,ok,,swedish childhood tumor biobank,btb,v2,0.5592953,Swedish childhood tumor biobank,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Expert analysis of dental radiographs can provide crucial information for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved the highest accuracy in various benchmarks, including analyzing dental X-ray images to improve clinical care quality. The Tufts Dental Database, a new X-ray panoramic radiography image dataset, has been presented in this paper. This dataset consists of 1000 panoramic dental radiography images with expert labeling of abnormalities and teeth. The classification of radiography images was performed based on five different levels: anatomical location, peripheral characteristics, radiodensity, effects on the surrounding structure, and the abnormality category. This first-of-its-kind multimodal dataset also includes the radiologist's expertise captured in the form of eye-tracking and think-aloud protocol. The contributions of this work are 1) publicly available dataset that can help researchers to incorporate human expertise into AI and achieve more robust and accurate abnormality detection; 2) a benchmark performance analysis for various state-of-the-art systems for dental radiograph image enhancement and image segmentation using deep learning; 3) an in-depth review of various panoramic dental image datasets, along with segmentation and detection systems.

38083163,A modular system for the synchronized multimodal data acquisition during Awake Surgery: towards the emergence of a dedicated clinical database.,"Awake Surgery (AS) is considered the best treatment for brain tumors located in or near eloquent areas. During this intervention, Direct Electrical Stimulations (DES) are delivered by the surgeon on the patient's brain in order to obtain an accurate brain mapping of the patient. The patient is asked to perform various tasks (e.g. counting, object naming, emotion recognition) through neuropsychological tests during these stimulations. These DES may cause a reversible lesion inducing deficits on the patient which can be observed during these tasks by the medical staff. The resection is then performed or not according to the patient's response. The intraoperative deficits can take several forms and can be difficult to analyze and identify. The development of new solutions allowing the automatic detection of these deficits could be therefore essential. However, still today, no structured and organized AS dedicated database is available that could be used to train and test these algorithms. We propose a modular system allowing the synchronized multimodal acquisition of various information including physiological measurements, DES signals and parameters, and task-related data to create such database.Clinical relevance- Acquiring synchronized multimodal data during AS will allow the creation of a dedicated database that could then be used to reveal new correlations between DES and the patient's response, and to develop and test new algorithms for the automatic detection of deficits.",False,True,,0.62737757,,awake,16.55639076,ok,,direct electrical stimulations,,v2,0.55639076,modular system for the synchronized multimodal data acquisition during Awake Surgery,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

However, home cage monitoring (HCM) is often impractical at scale over prolonged periods of time without significant loss of data. To achieve this, we developed MIROSLAV, the Multicage InfraRed Open-Source Locomotor Activity eValuator, a home cage activity and environmental monitoring device designed to be open, adaptable, and robust. Its transparent and modular design allows the device to be tailored to varying experimental requirements and environmental conditions, while its wireless operation and multiple redundancies minimise loss of data and animal disturbance.

40382353,Feature fusion-enhanced t-SNE image atlas for geophysical features discovery.,"The discovery and identification of geophysical features from diverse gridded datasets play a pivotal role in understanding geological phenomena. Traditional tools tailored to identify specific signatures, such as lineaments in magnetic data, do not account for (1) the naturally occurring complexity of the causative geology which results from competing and overprinting processes and (2) often overlook important related patterns present in other forms of data (e.g., gradients in the associated gravity data). To address those limitations, we propose a two-step data-driven approach that integrates diverse gridded datasets and autonomously reveals inherent patterns without predefined assumptions in terms of feature geometry. Utilizing Haralick texture descriptors, we encode data patches from different geophysical datasets as points in a high-dimensional unified representation space, facilitating seamless data fusion. This representation is then nonlinearly projected into a two-dimensional space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), forming an interactive ""t-SNE Atlas"". This atlas positions tiles from each dataset according to their position in the t-SNE while linking them back to their original geographical coordinates. Such a setup allows earth scientists to intuitively navigate through the data, exploring complex relationships between geophysical responses and geological structures, thus facilitating the discovery of new insights, the formulation of hypotheses, and the exploration of non-trivial connections. This is illustrated using magnetic and gravity data covering [Formula: see text] in the east Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia. Our methodology is adaptable and can be extended to include various other gridded datasets like gamma-ray spectrometry data, satellite imagery, and digital terrain models, thus broadening its applicability and enhancing geoscientific exploration.

39319243,"Highlighting overlooked biodiversity through online platforms: The ""Chalcid Wasps of Cyprus"" website.","Biodiversity data platforms including databases, websites and data repositories underpin conservation efforts by collecting spatiotemporal data of discovered native and alien species and maps of their distributions. Chalcid wasps (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea) are one of the most diverse insect groups estimated to include half a million species. Being mostly parasitoids of other arthropods, they have been successfully used as biological control agents against serious agricultural pests worldwide. In Cyprus, only 124 species of chalcid wasps have been recorded, with 53 species being alien to the island. Their true biodiversity is predicted to be much larger because the island is both under-sampled and under-researched. A number of biodiversity data platforms focusing on the biodiversity of Cyprus are currently online; however, an online platform dedicated on the chalcid wasps of Cyprus is lacking. In the framework of the Darwin Plus Fellowship (DPLUS202) ""Species richness and biological invasions of Chalcid wasps in Akrotiri Peninsula"", the ""Chalcid wasps of Cyprus"" website (https://sites.google.com/view/chalcidwaspscyprus) is presented. This online, dynamic database aims to: (1) raise public awareness regarding a rather neglected and yet ecologically important insect group, (2) provide data on the morphology, ecology and biodiversity of Chalcidoidea on Cyprus, as well as (3) promote conservation needs by setting a baseline for the future assessment of both native and alien chalcid wasp species.

Its primary focus is integrating experimental gene function information from the peer-reviewed literature and codifying it as controlled vocabulary annotations. Our goal is to produce a ""gold standard"" functional annotation set that reflects the current state of knowledge about the Arabidopsis genome. At the same time, the resource serves as a nexus for community-based collaborations aimed at improving data quality, access, and reuse. For the past decade, our work has been made possible by subscriptions from our global user base. This update covers our ongoing biocuration work, some of our modernization efforts that contribute to the first major infrastructure overhaul since 2011, the introduction of JBrowse2, and the resource's role in community activities such as organizing the structural reannotation of the genome. For gene function assessment, we used gene ontology annotations as a metric to evaluate: (1) what is currently known about Arabidopsis gene function and (2) the set of ""unknown"" genes. Currently, 74% of the proteome has been annotated to at least one gene ontology term. Of those loci, half have experimental support for at least one of the following aspects: molecular function, biological process, or cellular component. Our work sheds light on the genes for which we have not yet identified any published experimental data and have no functional annotation.

Photoproximity labeling methods, like μMap, have recently emerged as high-resolution techniques for mapping spatial relationships within subcellular architectures. However, <i>in vitro</i> models typically utilized lack the cell-type heterogeneity and three-dimensional structure essential for translating findings to clinical settings. To this end, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are invaluable model systems for biomedical research, as they preserve complex multicellular interaction networks in their natural environment. While identifying microscale interactions in these samples could provide critical clinical insights, chemical modifications introduced during formalin-fixation and de-cross-linking are incompatible with standard photoproximity labeling techniques.

These defects not only influence aesthetics but can also affect the performance of the PCB and potentially damage the entire board. Thus, achieving efficient and highly accurate detection of PCB surface defects is fundamental for quality control in fabrication. The rapidly advancing deep learning (DL) technology holds promising prospects for providing accurate and efficient detection methods for surface defects on PCB. To facilitate DL model training, it is imperative to compile a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse surface defect types found on PCB at a significant scale. This work categorized PCB surface defects into 9 distinct categories based on factors such as their causes, locations, and morphologies and developed a dataset of PCB surface defect (DsPCBSD+).

39511198,ST40 electromagnetic predictive studies supported by machine learning applied to experimental database.,"Nuclear fusion is entering the era of power plant-scale devices, which are now undergoing extensive studies to support the design phase. Plasma disruptions pose a high risk to these classes of devices because of the large stored thermal and magnetic energy which might jeopardize machine integrity and availability. Therefore, disruptions within these devices must be virtually eliminated, and any disruptions which do happen must be highly mitigated. However, the characterisation, prediction and technology used to mitigate disruptions is still an area of active development. In this paper, the authors investigate the disruptions within ST40, with particular attention at the identification of causes and effects associated with disruptions, both from a physics basis and an engineering standpoint. This paper aims at presenting preliminary predictive analyses of ST40 plasma scenarios by exploiting Machine Learning techniques applied to an experimental database populated by plasma pulses executed during the ST40 2021-2022 experimental campaign. The database contains both disrupted and non-disrupted pulses. Using Machine Learning, common features within disruptions are automatically classified and identified, mapping the controllable operational space in terms of plasma displacement and variation of specific plasma internal parameters. The classification was validated by benchmarking the numerical reconstruction of the plasma dynamics with experimental data recovered from the plasma diagnostics. Subsequent Machine Learning analyses allowed the extrapolation of new disrupted plasma configurations for preliminary predictive simulations of the plasma column displacement. Thanks to the numerical simulations performed in MAXFEA environment, it is possible to investigate the plasma vertical displacement both during disrupted and regularly terminated plasma scenarios and to provide lessons to be learnt for the next ST40 experimental campaign and for the design of future ST devices.",False,True,,0.6963932,,st4,16.51565325,ok,,,,v2,0.51565325,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

36520016,TIRESIA: An eXplainable Artificial Intelligence Platform for Predicting Developmental Toxicity.,"Herein, a robust and reproducible eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach is presented, which allows prediction of developmental toxicity, a challenging human-health endpoint in toxicology. The application of XAI as an alternative method is of the utmost importance with developmental toxicity being one of the most animal-intensive areas of regulatory toxicology. In this work, the established CAESAR (Computer Assisted Evaluation of industrial chemical Substances According to Regulations) training set made of 234 chemicals for model learning is employed. Two test sets, including as a whole 585 chemicals, were instead used for validation and generalization purposes. The proposed framework favorably compares with the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, thus resulting in a reliable support system for developmental toxicity ensuring informativeness, uncertainty estimation, generalization, and transparency. Based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm, our predictive model provides easy interpretative keys based on specific molecular descriptors and structural alerts enabling one to distinguish toxic and nontoxic chemicals. Inspired by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles for the validation of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) for regulatory purposes, the results are summarized in a standard report in portable document format, enclosing also details concerned with a density-based model applicability domain and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainability, the latter particularly useful to better understand the effective roles played by molecular features.

37093469,Mini-Bioreactor Platform for Membrane Protein Production in Komagataella pastoris.,"Membrane proteins (MPs) play vital roles across various cellular functions, biological processes, physiological signaling pathways, and human-related disorders. Considering the clinical relevance of MPs and their application as therapeutic targets, it is crucial to explore highly effective production platforms and purification approaches to ultimately obtain a high-resolution structure of the target. Therefore, it would be possible to gather detailed knowledge on their mechanism of action which will be the basis for the rational design of novel and stronger drugs. Unfortunately, when compared to their soluble counterparts, 3D structures of MPs are really scarce (<2%), mainly due to poorly natural abundance, challenges associated with protein solubility and stability, and difficulties in producing bioactive and properly structural folded targets. These drawbacks could significantly impair the use of MPs as therapeutic targeting and demand efforts to develop tailor-made strategies for their appropriate handling. Therefore, this chapter is focused on describing a detailed and high-throughput procedure for the biosynthesis of MPs using Komagataella pastoris cell cultures as expression system in a mini-bioreactor platform.

33226952,aWCluster: A Novel Integrative Network-Based Clustering of Multiomics for Subtype Analysis of Cancer Data.,"The remarkable growth of multi-platform genomic profiles has led to the challenge of multiomics data integration. In this study, we present a novel network-based multiomics clustering founded on the Wasserstein distance from optimal mass transport. This distance has many important geometric properties making it a suitable choice for application in machine learning and clustering. Our proposed method of aggregating multiomics and Wasserstein distance clustering (aWCluster) is applied to breast carcinoma as well as bladder carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, renal carcinoma, lung non-small cell adenocarcinoma, and endometrial carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. Subtypes were characterized by the concordant effect of mRNA expression, DNA copy number alteration, and DNA methylation of genes and their neighbors in the interaction network. aWCluster successfully clusters all cancer types into classes with significantly different survival rates. Also, a gene ontology enrichment analysis of significant genes in the low survival subgroup of breast cancer leads to the well-known phenomenon of tumor hypoxia and the transcription factor ETS1 whose expression is induced by hypoxia. We believe aWCluster has the potential to discover novel subtypes and biomarkers by accentuating the genes that have concordant multiomics measurements in their interaction network, which are challenging to find without the network inference or with single omics analysis.",False,True,,0.6996989,awcluster,,16.0,ok,,the cancer genome atlas,,spacy,0.0,aWCluster,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

35913976,MiCloud: A unified web platform for comprehensive microbiome data analysis.,"The recent advance in massively parallel sequencing has enabled accurate microbiome profiling at a dramatically lowered cost. Then, the human microbiome has been the subject of intensive investigation in public health and medicine. In the meanwhile, researchers have developed lots of microbiome data analysis methods, protocols, and/or tools. Among those, especially, the web platforms can be highlighted because of the user-friendly interfaces and streamlined protocols for a long sequence of analytic procedures. However, existing web platforms can handle only a categorical trait of interest, cross-sectional study design, and the analysis with no covariate adjustment. We therefore introduce here a unified web platform, named MiCloud, for a binary or continuous trait of interest, cross-sectional or longitudinal/family-based study design, and with or without covariate adjustment. MiCloud handles all such types of analyses for both ecological measures (i.e., alpha and beta diversity indices) and microbial taxa in relative abundance on different taxonomic levels (i.e., phylum, class, order, family, genus and species). Importantly, MiCloud also provides a unified analytic protocol that streamlines data inputs, quality controls, data transformations, statistical methods and visualizations with vastly extended utility and flexibility that are suited to microbiome data analysis. We illustrate the use of MiCloud through the United Kingdom twin study on the association between gut microbiome and body mass index adjusting for age.

40567045,STEER: Open Access Resources for Conducting Structured Expert Elicitation for Health Care Decision Making.,"In a landscape of accelerated approvals and a less mature evidence base, constrained health systems make reimbursement decisions based on uncertain evidence about the expected clinical and economic value of a health technology. Uncertain decisions require expert judgments, and there has recently been a drive to improve the accountability and transparency in the way these judgments are collected and reported. Structured expert elicitation (SEE) refers to formal methods to quantify experts' judgments. Protocols for conducting SEE exist; however, the time and resource requirements of SEE and the lack of simple tools for its implementation are potential deterrents to its implementation. This article describes the development of Structured Expert Elicitation Resources (STEER), a collection of open access resources based on a published protocol for SEE specific to the health care decision-making (HCDM) setting. The resources cover the entire SEE process from design to reporting. The resources include an overview and a practical guide for conducting SEE in this setting, adaptable tools for building bespoke SEE exercises, training materials for experts taking part in SEE, resources used in previous SEE exercises, and examples of published SEE in HCDM.

39354632,MeSH2Matrix: combining MeSH keywords and machine learning for biomedical relation classification based on PubMed.,"Biomedical relation classification has been significantly improved by the application of advanced machine learning techniques on the raw texts of scholarly publications. Despite this improvement, the reliance on large chunks of raw text makes these algorithms suffer in terms of generalization, precision, and reliability. The use of the distinctive characteristics of bibliographic metadata can prove effective in achieving better performance for this challenging task. In this research paper, we introduce an approach for biomedical relation classification using the qualifiers of co-occurring Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). First of all, we introduce MeSH2Matrix, our dataset consisting of 46,469 biomedical relations curated from PubMed publications using our approach. Our dataset includes a matrix that maps associations between the qualifiers of subject MeSH keywords and those of object MeSH keywords. It also specifies the corresponding Wikidata relation type and the superclass of semantic relations for each relation. Using MeSH2Matrix, we build and train three machine learning models (Support Vector Machine [SVM], a dense model [D-Model], and a convolutional neural network [C-Net]) to evaluate the efficiency of our approach for biomedical relation classification. Our best model achieves an accuracy of 70.78% for 195 classes and 83.09% for five superclasses. Finally, we provide confusion matrix and extensive feature analyses to better examine the relationship between the MeSH qualifiers and the biomedical relations being classified. Our results will hopefully shed light on developing better algorithms for biomedical ontology classification based on the MeSH keywords of PubMed publications.

35864937,The GWAS-MAP|ovis platform for aggregation and analysis of genome-wide association study results in sheep.,"In recent years, the number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) carried out for various economically important animal traits has been increasing. GWAS discoveries provide summary statistics that can be used both for targeted marker-oriented selection and for studying the genetic control of economically important traits of farm animals. In contrast to research in human genetics, GWAS on farm animals often does not meet generally accepted standards (availability of information about effect and reference alleles, the size and direction of the effect, etc.). This greatly complicates the use of GWAS results for breeding needs. Within the framework of human genetics, there are several technological solutions for researching the harmonized results of GWAS, including one of the largest, the GWAS-MAP platform. For other types of living organisms, including economically important agricultural animals, there are no similar solutions. To our knowledge, no similar solution has been proposed to date for any of the species of economically important animals. As part of this work, we focused on creating a platform similar to GWAS-MAP for working with the results of GWAS of sheep, since sheep breeding is one of the most important branches of agriculture. By analogy with the GWAS-MAP platform for storing, unifying and analyzing human GWAS, we have created the GWAS-MAP|ovis platform. The platform currently contains information on more than 34 million associations between genomic sequence variants and traits of meat production in sheep. The platform can also be used to conduct colocalization analysis, a method that allows one to determine whether the association of a particular locus with two different traits is the result of pleiotropy or whether these traits are associated with different variants that are in linkage disequilibrium. This platform will be useful for breeders to select promising markers for breeding, as well as to obtain information for the introduction of genomic breeding and for scientists to replicate the results obtained.",False,True,,0.7188202,,gwas- | map,16.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Herein, an ultrasensitive, paper-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioassay platform is constructed by in situ grown ZnO/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> heterojunctions onto paper fibers, which acted as photoactive signal amplification probes for enhancing the sensitivity of antibodies-based diagnostic assays, for the sensitive detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) targets. The crystalline flake-like ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> composited with hexagonal nanorods (NRs) morphology of ZnO is an in situ grown, at the first time, onto cellulose fibers surface supported with Au nanoparticle (Au NP) modification to improve conductivity of the device working zone. The obtained composites on paper fibers are implemented as a flexible paper-based photoelectrode to realize remarkable performance of the fabricated <i>μ</i>PAD, resulting from the enhanced PEC activity of heterojunctions with effective electron-hole pair separation for accelerating photoelectric conversion efficiency of the sensing process under light irradiation. Once the target AFP was introduced into the biosensing interface assistant, with a specific recognition interaction of AFP antibody, a drastically photocurrent response was generated, in view of the apparent steric effects. With the concentration increase of AFP targets, more immune conjugates could be confined onto the biosensing interface, eventually leading to the quantitative decrease of photocurrent intensity. Combined with an ingenious origami design and permitting the hydrophobic/hydrophilic conversion procedure in the bioassay process, the ultrasensitive PEC detection of AFP targets was realized. Under the optimized conditions, the level of AFP could be sensitively tracked by the prepared <i>μ</i>PAD with a liner range from 0.1 to 100 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and limit of detection of 0.03 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>.

SMILES was used to encode the chemical structures of the molecules, and we tabulated the reported proton conductivity, proton diffusion coefficient, and material composition for a total of 3152 data points. The data spans a broad range of temperatures ranging from -70 to 260 °C. To explore this landscape of nonaqueous proton conductors, DFT was used to calculate the proton affinity of 18 unique proton carriers. The results were then compared to the activation energy derived from fitting experimental data to the Arrhenius equation. It was found that while the widely recognized positive correlation between the activation energy and proton affinity may hold among closely related molecules, this correlation does not necessarily apply across a broader range of molecules. This work serves as an example of the potential analyses that can be conducted using literature data combined with emerging research tools in computation and data science to address specific materials design problems.",False,True,,0.70909274,database of nonaqueous proton-conducting materials,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40354347,Automated self-service cohort selection for large-scale population sciences and observational research: The California teachers study researcher platform.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Cohort selection is ubiquitous and essential, but manual and ad hoc approaches are time-consuming, labor-intense, and difficult to scale. We sought to automate the task of cohort selection by building self-service tools that enable researchers to independently generate datasets for population sciences research.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The California Teachers Study (CTS) is a prospective observational study of 133,477 women who have been followed continuously since 1995. The CTS includes extensive survey-based and real-world data from cancer, hospitalization, and mortality linkages. We curated data from our data warehouse into a column-oriented database and developed a researcher-facing web application that guides researchers through the project lifecycle; captures researchers' inputs; and automatically generates custom and analysis-ready data, code, dictionaries, and documentation.<h4>Results</h4>Researchers can register, access data, and propose projects on the CTS Researcher Platform via our CTS website. The Platform supports cohort and cross-sectional study designs for cancer, mortality, and any other ICD-based phenotypes or endpoints. User-friendly prompts and menus capture analytic design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, endpoint definitions, censoring rules, and covariate selection. Our platform empowers researchers everywhere to query, choose, review, and automatically and quickly receive custom data, analytic scripts, and documentation for their research projects. Research teams can review, revise, and update their choices anytime.<h4>Discussion</h4>We replaced inefficient traditional cohort-selection processes with an integrated self-service approach that simplifies and improves cohort selection for all stakeholders. Compared with manual methods, our solution is faster and more scalable, user-friendly, and collaborative. Other studies could re-configure our individual database, project-tracking, website, and data-delivery components for their own specific needs, or they could utilize other widely available solutions (e.g., alternative database or project-tracking tools) to enable similarly automated cohort-selection in their own settings.

39895661,ParasitoBank dataset for diagnosing intestinal parasitism: Helminths and protozoa in coprological samples.,"Intestinal parasitism is an infection that affects people worldwide, with populations in developing countries being at a higher risk of acquiring it. This infection is contracted for various reasons, mainly related to poor sanitary conditions and inadequate food practices, leading to multiple health issues such as malnutrition, intestinal obstructions, epilepsy, and others. Identifying parasitic species is essential for establishing appropriate antiparasitic therapy, which in turn helps reduce the risk of associated morbidities. For this reason, a dataset named ""ParasitoBank"" was created, containing 779 images of the visual field of fresh stool samples analysed under a microscope using the serial coprological technique. These images were acquired using a Motorola G84 mobile phone, and a data-labeling process resulted in a total of 1,620 intestinal parasites, with a particular focus on intestinal protozoa. The images have an approximate aspect ratio of 1:1 with a resolution of 2100 × 2100. Label information and some metadata for the images have been included in a JSON file following the ""Common Objects in Context"" (COCO) format.

38732403,Carob: A Mediterranean Resource for the Future.,"For centuries, the carob tree (<i>Ceratonia siliqua</i> L.) has contributed to the economy of the Mediterranean basin, mainly as food for livestock. Nowadays, the value of the carob tree extends far beyond its traditional uses, encompassing a wide range of industries and applications that take advantage of its unique properties and nutritional benefits. Despite its high industrial demand and European indications, there has been a 65% reduction in the area cultivated throughout the Mediterranean area in the 21st century. Given the threats posed by climate change, including reduced water availability and nutrient-depleted soils, there is a growing need to focus on this crop, which is well placed to cope with unpredictable weather. In this review, we use a bibliographic search approach to emphasise the prioritisation of research needs for effective carob tree exploitation. We found enormous gaps in the scientific knowledge of this under-utilised crop species with fruit pulp and seeds of high industrial value. Insufficient understanding of the biology of the species, as well as inadequate agronomic practices, compromise the quantity and the quality of fruits available to the industry. In addition to industrial applications, carob can also be used in reforestation or restoration programmes, providing a valuable crop while promoting biodiversity conservation and soil restoration. The carbon sequestration potential of the trees should be taken into account as a promising alternative in fighting climate change.

Converting in-situ irradiation TEM video data into meaningful information on defect cluster dynamic properties (e.g., lifetime) has become the major technical bottleneck. Here, we present a solution called the DefectTrack, the first dedicated deep learning-based one-shot multi-object tracking (MOT) model capable of tracking cascade-induced defect clusters in in-situ TEM videos in real-time. DefectTrack has achieved a Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 66.43% and a Mostly Tracked (MT) of 67.81% on the test set, which are comparable to state-of-the-art MOT algorithms. We discuss the MOT framework, model selection, training, and evaluation strategies for in-situ TEM applications. Further, we compare the DefectTrack with four human experts in quantifying defect cluster lifetime distributions using statistical tests and discuss the relationship between the material science domain metrics and MOT metrics.

40108717,Evidence of the impacts of pharmaceuticals on aquatic animal behaviour (EIPAAB): a systematic map and open access database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Over the last decade, pharmaceutical pollution in aquatic ecosystems has emerged as a pressing environmental issue. Recent years have also seen a surge in scientific interest in the use of behavioural endpoints in chemical risk assessment and regulatory activities, underscoring their importance for fitness and survival. In this respect, data on how pharmaceuticals alter the behaviour of aquatic animals appears to have grown rapidly. Despite this, there has been a notable absence of systematic efforts to consolidate and summarise this field of study. To address this, our objectives were twofold: (1) to systematically identify, catalogue, and synthesise primary research articles on the effects of pharmaceuticals on aquatic animal behaviour; and (2) to organise this information into a comprehensive open-access database for scientists, policymakers, and environmental managers.<h4>Methods</h4>We systematically searched two electronic databases (Web of Science and Scopus) and supplemented these with additional article sources. The search string followed a Population-Exposure-Comparison-Outcome framework to capture articles that used an aquatic organism (population) to test the effects of a pharmaceutical (exposure) on behaviour (outcome). Articles were screened in two stages: title and abstract, followed by full-text screening alongside data extraction. Decision trees were designed a priori to appraise eligibility at both stages. Information on study validity was collected but not used as a basis for inclusion. Data synthesis focused on species, compounds, behaviour, and quality themes and was enhanced with additional sources of metadata from online databases (e.g. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy, PubChem, and IUCN Red List of Threatened Species).<h4>Review findings</h4>We screened 5,988 articles, of which 901 were included in the final database, representing 1,739 unique species-by-compound combinations. The database includes data collected over 48 years (1974-2022), with most articles having an environmental focus (510) and fewer relating to medical and basic research topics (233 and 158, respectively). The database includes 173 species (8 phyla and 21 classes). Ray-finned fishes were by far the most common clade (75% of the evidence base), and most studies focused on freshwater compared to marine species (80.4% versus 19.6%). The database includes 426 pharmaceutical compounds; the most common groups were antidepressants (28%), antiepileptics (11%), and anxiolytics (10%). Evidence for the impacts on locomotion and boldness/anxiety behaviours were most commonly assessed. Almost all behaviours were scored in a laboratory setting, with only 0.5% measured under field conditions. Generally, we detected poor reporting and/or compliance with several of our study validity criteria.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our systematic map revealed a rapid increase in this research area over the past 15 years. We highlight multiple areas now suitable for quantitative synthesis and areas where evidence is lacking. We also highlight some pitfalls in method reporting and practice. More detailed reporting would facilitate the use of behavioural endpoints in aquatic toxicology studies, chemical risk assessment, regulatory management activities, and improve replicability.

40005591,γBMGC: A Comprehensive and Accurate Database for Screening TMAO-Associated Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Dietary l-carnitine produces γ-butylbetaine (γBB) in a gut-microbiota-dependent manner in humans, and has been proven to be an intermediate product possibly associated with incident cardiovascular diseases or major adverse events. Eliminating or reducing the production of microbiota-dependent γBB may contribute to adjuvant therapy for cardiovascular diseases. However, to date, our understanding of the γBB metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) and associated microorganisms remains limited. To solve this problem, we constructed a manually curated γBB metabolic gene cluster database (γBMGC) based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It comprised 171,510 allelic genes from 85 species and 20 genera, which could effectively provide high-resolution analysis at the strain level. For simulated gene datasets, with a 50% identity cutoff, we achieved an annotation accuracy, PPV, specificity, F1-score, and NPV of 99.4%, 97.97%, 99.16%, 98.97%, and 100%, respectively, which significantly outperformed existing databases such as KEGG at similar thresholds. The γBMGC database is more accurate, comprehensive, and faster for profiling cardiovascular disease (CVD)-associated genes at the species or strain level, offering a higher resolution in identifying strain-specific γBB metabolic pathways compared to existing databases like KEGG or COG. Meanwhile, we validated the excellent performance of γBMGC in gene abundance analysis and bacterial species distinction. γBMGC is a powerful database for enhancing our understanding of the microbial l-carnitine pathway in the human gut, enabling rapid and high-accuracy analyses of the associated cardiovascular disease processes.",False,True,,0.65935504,,γbmgc,16.0,ok,,a comprehensive and accurate database for screening tmao-associated cardiovascular diseases | gene cluster,kegg | cog,spacy,0.0,γBMGC,True,5.0,True,True,,,False,,1

However, discovery and experimental validation of probiotics require extensive time and effort. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop effective screening methods for identifying probiotics. Advances in sequencing technology have generated massive genomic data, enabling us to create a machine learning-based platform for such purpose in this work. This study first selected a comprehensive probiotics genome dataset from the probiotic database (PROBIO) and literature surveys. Then, k-mer (from 2 to 8) compositional analysis was performed, revealing diverse oligonucleotide composition in strain genomes and apparently more probiotic (P-) features in probiotic genomes than non-probiotic genomes. To reduce noise and improve computational efficiency, 87 376 k-mers were refined by an incremental feature selection (IFS) method, and the model achieved the maximum accuracy level at 184 core features, with a high prediction accuracy (97.77%) and area under the curve (98.00%). Functional genomic analysis using annotations from gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) databases, as well as analysis of genes associated with host gastrointestinal survival/settlement, carbohydrate utilization, drug resistance and virulence factors, revealed that the distribution of P-features was biased toward genes/pathways related to probiotic function. Our results suggest that the role of probiotics is not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of k-mer genomic components, providing new insights into the identification and underlying mechanisms of probiotics.

However, novel approaches are needed to track community dynamics and genomic flux within metagenomes, particularly in response to perturbations. We describe KOMB, a novel method for tracking genome level dynamics within microbiomes. KOMB utilizes K-core decomposition to identify Structural variations (SVs), specifically, population-level Copy Number Variation (CNV) within microbiomes. K-core decomposition partitions the graph into shells containing nodes of induced degree at least K, yielding reduced computational complexity compared to prior approaches. Through validation on a synthetic community, we show that KOMB recovers and profiles repetitive genomic regions in the sample. KOMB is shown to identify functionally-important regions in Human Microbiome Project datasets, and was used to analyze longitudinal data and identify keystone taxa in Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) samples. In summary, KOMB represents a novel graph-based, taxonomy-oblivious, and reference-free approach for tracking CNV within microbiomes.

Nevertheless, the current dearth of comprehensive platforms providing evolutionary annotation information and multi-species multi-omics data impedes users from systematically and efficiently performing evolutionary and functional analysis on specific genes. In order to establish an advanced plant multi-omics platform that provides timely, accurate, and high-caliber omics information, we collected 7 distinct types of omics data from 6 monocots, 6 dicots, and 1 moss, and reanalyzed these data using standardized pipelines. Additionally, we furnished homology information, duplication events, and phylostratigraphic stages of 13 species to facilitate evolutionary examination. Furthermore, the integrative plant omics platform (IPOP) is bundled with a variety of online analysis tools that aid users in conducting evolutionary and functional analysis. Specifically, the Multi-omics Integration Analysis tool is available to consolidate information from diverse omics sources, while the Transcriptome-wide Association Analysis tool facilitates the linkage of functional analysis with phenotype. To illustrate the application of IPOP, we conducted a case study on the YTH domain gene family, wherein we observed shared functionalities within orthologous groups and discerned variations in evolutionary patterns across these groups. To summarize, the IPOP platform offers valuable evolutionary insights and multi-omics data to the plant sciences community, effectively addressing the need for cross-species comparison and evolutionary research platforms.

The experimental results of the NLM-CHEM track demonstrate that our method can achieve remarkable performance, with F1-scores of 85% and 91.8% in strict and approximate evaluations, respectively. Moreover, the proposed Medical Subject Headings identifier (MeSH ID) normalization algorithm is effective in entity normalization, which achieved a F1-score of about 80% in both strict and approximate evaluations.

The Rat Genome Database (RGD) created a COVID-19 Disease Portal to leverage information from the scientific literature. In the COVID-19 Portal, gene-disease associations are established by manual curation of PubMed literature. The portal contains data for nine ontologies related to COVID-19, an embedded enrichment analysis tool, as well as links to a toolkit. Using these information and tools, we performed analyses on the curated COVID-19 disease genes. As expected, Disease Ontology enrichment analysis showed that the COVID-19 gene set is highly enriched with coronavirus infectious disease and related diseases. However, other less related diseases were also highly enriched, such as liver and rheumatic diseases. Using the comparison heatmap tool, we found nearly 60 percent of the COVID-19 genes were associated with nervous system disease and 40 percent were associated with gastrointestinal disease. Our analysis confirms the role of the immune system in COVID-19 pathogenesis as shown by substantial enrichment of immune system related Gene Ontology terms.

38192003,FAVA: high-quality functional association networks inferred from scRNA-seq and proteomics data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein networks are commonly used for understanding how proteins interact. However, they are typically biased by data availability, favoring well-studied proteins with more interactions. To uncover functions of understudied proteins, we must use data that are not affected by this literature bias, such as single-cell RNA-seq and proteomics. Due to data sparseness and redundancy, functional association analysis becomes complex.<h4>Results</h4>To address this, we have developed FAVA (Functional Associations using Variational Autoencoders), which compresses high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space. FAVA infers networks from high-dimensional omics data with much higher accuracy than existing methods, across a diverse collection of real as well as simulated datasets. FAVA can process large datasets with over 0.5 million conditions and has predicted 4210 interactions between 1039 understudied proteins. Our findings showcase FAVA's capability to offer novel perspectives on protein interactions. FAVA functions within the scverse ecosystem, employing AnnData as its input source.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code, documentation, and tutorials for FAVA are accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/mikelkou/fava.

Although velvet bean is a very important plant species for food and pharmaceutical manufacturing, the lack of genetic and genomic information about this species severely hinders further molecular research thereon and biotechnological development. Here, we reported the first velvet bean genome, with a size of 500.49 Mb and 11 chromosomes encoding 28,010 proteins. Genomic comparison among legume species indicated that velvet bean speciated ∼29 Ma from soybean clade, without specific genome duplication. Importantly, we identified 21 polyphenol oxidase coding genes that catalyse l-tyrosine to L-DOPA in velvet bean, and two subfamilies showing tandem expansion on Chr3 and Chr7 after speciation. Interestingly, disease-resistant and anti-pathogen gene families were found contracted in velvet bean, which might be related to the expansion of polyphenol oxidase. Our study generated a high-quality genomic reference for velvet bean, an economically important agricultural and medicinal plant, and the newly reported L-DOPA biosynthetic genes could provide indispensable information for the biotechnological and sustainable development of an environment-friendly L-DOPA biosynthesis processing method.",False,True,,0.6003872,,dopa,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
38224813,PRA-Pred: Structure-based prediction of protein-RNA binding affinity.,"Understanding crucial factors that affect the binding affinity of protein-RNA complexes is vital for comprehending their recognition mechanisms. This study involved compiling experimentally measured binding affinity (ΔG) values of 217 protein-RNA complexes and extracting numerous structure-based features, considering RNA, protein, and interactions between protein and RNA. Our findings indicate the significance of RNA base-step parameters, interaction energies, number of atomic contacts in the complex, hydrogen bonds, and contact potentials in understanding the binding affinity. Further, we observed that these factors are influenced by the type of RNA strand and the function of the protein in a protein-RNA complex. Multiple regression equations were developed for different classes of complexes to perform the prediction of the binding affinity between the protein and RNA. We evaluated the models using the jack-knife test and achieved an overall correlation 0.77 between the experimental and predicted binding affinities with a mean absolute error of 1.02 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we introduced a web server, PRA-Pred, intended for the prediction of protein-RNA binding affinity, and it is freely accessible through https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/prapred/.

37225408,GraphscoreDTA: optimized graph neural network for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Computational approaches for identifying the protein-ligand binding affinity can greatly facilitate drug discovery and development. At present, many deep learning-based models are proposed to predict the protein-ligand binding affinity and achieve significant performance improvement. However, protein-ligand binding affinity prediction still has fundamental challenges. One challenge is that the mutual information between proteins and ligands is hard to capture. Another challenge is how to find and highlight the important atoms of the ligands and residues of the proteins.<h4>Results</h4>To solve these limitations, we develop a novel graph neural network strategy with the Vina distance optimization terms (GraphscoreDTA) for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity, which takes the combination of graph neural network, bitransport information mechanism and physics-based distance terms into account for the first time. Unlike other methods, GraphscoreDTA can not only effectively capture the protein-ligand pairs' mutual information but also highlight the important atoms of the ligands and residues of the proteins. The results show that GraphscoreDTA significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple test sets. Furthermore, the tests of drug-target selectivity on the cyclin-dependent kinase and the homologous protein families demonstrate that GraphscoreDTA is a reliable tool for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The resource codes are available at https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/GraphscoreDTA.",False,True,,0.71133155,graphscoredta,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,GraphscoreDTA,False,0.0,True,False,https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/GraphscoreDTA,,False,,1
39175133,HTINet2: herb-target prediction via knowledge graph embedding and residual-like graph neural network.,"Target identification is one of the crucial tasks in drug research and development, as it aids in uncovering the action mechanism of herbs/drugs and discovering new therapeutic targets. Although multiple algorithms of herb target prediction have been proposed, due to the incompleteness of clinical knowledge and the limitation of unsupervised models, accurate identification for herb targets still faces huge challenges of data and models. To address this, we proposed a deep learning-based target prediction framework termed HTINet2, which designed three key modules, namely, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and clinical knowledge graph embedding, residual graph representation learning, and supervised target prediction. In the first module, we constructed a large-scale knowledge graph that covers the TCM properties and clinical treatment knowledge of herbs, and designed a component of deep knowledge embedding to learn the deep knowledge embedding of herbs and targets. In the remaining two modules, we designed a residual-like graph convolution network to capture the deep interactions among herbs and targets, and a Bayesian personalized ranking loss to conduct supervised training and target prediction. Finally, we designed comprehensive experiments, of which comparison with baselines indicated the excellent performance of HTINet2 (HR@10 increased by 122.7% and NDCG@10 by 35.7%), ablation experiments illustrated the positive effect of our designed modules of HTINet2, and case study demonstrated the reliability of the predicted targets of Artemisia annua and Coptis chinensis based on the knowledge base, literature, and molecular docking.",False,True,,0.6669668,htinet2,,16.0,ok,,herb-target prediction via knowledge graph embedding and residual-like graph neural network | a large-scale,,spacy,0.0,HTINet2,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1
38241279,Machine learning-based approach KEVOLVE efficiently identifies SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific genomic signatures.,"Machine learning was shown to be effective at identifying distinctive genomic signatures among viral sequences. These signatures are defined as pervasive motifs in the viral genome that allow discrimination between species or variants. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the identification of these signatures can assist in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, improve in the recognition and definition of emerging variants, and aid in the characterization of functional properties of polymorphic gene products. In this paper, we assess KEVOLVE, an approach based on a genetic algorithm with a machine-learning kernel, to identify multiple genomic signatures based on minimal sets of k-mers. In a comparative study, in which we analyzed large SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset, KEVOLVE was more effective at identifying variant-discriminative signatures than several gold-standard statistical tools. Subsequently, these signatures were characterized using a new extension of KEVOLVE (KANALYZER) to highlight variations of the discriminative signatures among different classes of variants, their genomic location, and the mutations involved. The majority of identified signatures were associated with known mutations among the different variants, in terms of functional and pathological impact based on available literature. Here we showed that KEVOLVE is a robust machine learning approach to identify discriminative signatures among SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are frequently also biologically relevant, while bypassing multiple sequence alignments.

The sentences in the database were designed so to include all phonemes of the Italian language, and also take into account the typical frequency of each phoneme in written Italian. Four native adult speakers of Standard Italian, raised and living in Rome, Italy, two female and two male, pronounced the sentences in two different recording sessions; two repetitions for each sentence per speaker were therefore collected, for a total of 800 recordings. The database was specifically created for application in the LaMIT project, that focuses on the application to the Italian language of the Lexical Access model proposed by Ken Stevens for American English. The model relies on the detection of specific acoustic discontinuities called landmarks and other acoustic cues to features that characterize each phoneme. Each recording was thus processed to generate a set of labeling files that identify both predicted landmarks and other cues, and actual landmarks/cues.

39502863,EstuarySAT Database Development of Harmonized Remote Sensing and Water Quality Data for Tidal and Estuarine Systems.,"Researchers and environmental managers need big datasets spanning long time periods to accurately assess current and historical water quality conditions in fresh and estuarine waters. Using remote sensing data, we can survey many water bodies simultaneously and evaluate water quality conditions with greater frequency. The combination of existing and historical water quality data with remote sensing imagery into a unified database allows researchers to improve remote sensing algorithms and improves understanding of mechanisms causing blooms. We report on the development of a water quality database ""EstuarySAT"" which combines data from the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) remote sensing platform and water quality data throughout the coastal USA. EstuarySAT builds upon an existing database and set of methods developed by the creators of AquaSat, whose region of interest is primarily larger freshwater lakes in the USA. Following the same basic methods, EstuarySAT utilizes open-source tools: R v. 3.24+ (statistical software), Python (dynamic programming environment), and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to develop a combined water quality data and remote sensing imagery database (EstuarySAT) for smaller coastal estuarine and freshwater tidal riverine systems. EstuarySAT fills a data gap that exists between freshwater and estuarine water bodies. We are able to evaluate smaller systems due to the higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (10 m pixel image resolution) vs. the Landsat platform used by AquaSat (30 m pixel resolution). Sentinel-2 also has a more frequent revisit (overpass) schedule of every 5 to 10 days vs. Landsat 7 which is every 17 days. EstuarySAT incorporates publicly available water quality data from 23 individual water quality data sources spanning 1984-2021 and spatially matches them with Sentinel-2 imagery from 2015-2021. EstuarySAT currently contains 299,851 matched observations distributed across the coastal USA. EstuarySAT's primary focus is on collecting chlorophyll data; however, it also contains other ancillary water quality data, including temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, and turbidity (where available). As compared to other ocean color databases used for developing predictive chlorophyll algorithms, this coastal database contains spectral profiles more typical of CDOM-dominated systems.

Across species, strategies for stochastic multicolour labelling have greatly facilitated in vivo cell tracking and mapping neuronal connectivity. Yet integrating multi-fluorophore information into the context of developing zebrafish tissues is challenging given their cytoplasmic localization and spectral incompatibility with common fluorescent markers. Inspired by Drosophila Raeppli, we developed FRaeppli (Fish-Raeppli) by expressing bright membrane- or nuclear-targeted fluorescent proteins for efficient cell shape analysis and tracking. High spatiotemporal activation flexibility is provided by the Gal4/UAS system together with Cre/lox and/or PhiC31 integrase. The distinct spectra of the FRaeppli fluorescent proteins allow simultaneous imaging with GFP and infrared subcellular reporters or tissue landmarks. We demonstrate the suitability of FRaeppli for live imaging of complex internal organs, such as the liver, and have tailored hyperspectral protocols for time-efficient acquisition. Combining FRaeppli with polarity markers revealed previously unknown canalicular topologies between differentiating hepatocytes, reminiscent of the mammalian liver, suggesting common developmental mechanisms.

Lebanon lacks an accurate inventory of anthropogenic emission fluxes. In the absence of a clear emission standard and standardized activity datasets in Lebanon, this work serves to fill this gap by presenting the first national effort to develop a national emission inventory by exhaustively quantifying detailed multisector, multi-species pollutant emissions in Lebanon for atmospheric pollutants that are internationally monitored and regulated as relevant to air quality.

40109352,"Enhancing the annotation of small ORF-altering variants using MORFEE: introducing MORFEEdb, a comprehensive catalog of SNVs affecting upstream ORFs in human 5'UTRs.","Non-canonical small open reading frames (sORFs) are among the main regulators of gene expression. The most studied of these are upstream ORFs (upORFs) located in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of coding genes. Internal ORFs (intORFs) in the coding sequence and downstream ORFs (dORFs) in the 3'UTR have received less attention. Different bioinformatics tools permit the prediction of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) altering upORFs, mainly those creating AUGs or deleting stop codons, but no tool predicts variants altering non-canonical translation initiation sites and those altering intORFs or dORFs. We propose an upgrade of our MORFEE bioinformatics tool to identify SNVs that may alter all types of sORFs in coding transcripts from a VCF file.

36357557,SimTune: bridging the simulator reality gap for resource management in edge-cloud computing.,"Industries and services are undergoing an Internet of Things centric transformation globally, giving rise to an explosion of multi-modal data generated each second. This, with the requirement of low-latency result delivery, has led to the ubiquitous adoption of edge and cloud computing paradigms. Edge computing follows the data gravity principle, wherein the computational devices move closer to the end-users to minimize data transfer and communication times. However, large-scale computation has exacerbated the problem of efficient resource management in hybrid edge-cloud platforms. In this regard, data-driven models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained popularity to give rise to the notion of edge intelligence. However, DNNs face significant problems of data saturation when fed volatile data. Data saturation is when providing more data does not translate to improvements in performance. To address this issue, prior work has leveraged coupled simulators that, akin to digital twins, generate out-of-distribution training data alleviating the data-saturation problem. However, simulators face the reality-gap problem, which is the inaccuracy in the emulation of real computational infrastructure due to the abstractions in such simulators. To combat this, we develop a framework, SimTune, that tackles this challenge by leveraging a low-fidelity surrogate model of the high-fidelity simulator to update the parameters of the latter, so to increase the simulation accuracy. This further helps co-simulated methods to generalize to edge-cloud configurations for which human encoded parameters are not known apriori. Experiments comparing SimTune against state-of-the-art data-driven resource management solutions on a real edge-cloud platform demonstrate that simulator tuning can improve quality of service metrics such as energy consumption and response time by up to 14.7% and 7.6% respectively.",False,True,,0.6997204,simtune,,16.0,ok,,bridging the simulator reality gap for resource management in edge-cloud computing,,spacy,0.0,SimTune,True,3.0,True,True,,,False,,1

During the past few decades, numerous field investigations have been conducted to estimate grassland NPP since the measuring criterion released by the International Biological Program. However, a comprehensive NPP database, particularly for belowground NPP (BNPP), in global grasslands is rare to date. Here, field NPP measurements from 438 publications (1957-2018) in global grasslands were collected, critically filtered, and incorporated in a comprehensive global database with observations for aboveground NPP (ANPP), BNPP, total NPP (TNPP), and BNPP fraction (f<sub>BNPP</sub> ). Associated information on geographical locations, climatic records, grassland types, land use patterns, manipulations subjected to manipulative experiments, sampling year of study sites, as well as NPP measurement methods are also documented. This database included 2985 entries from 1785 study sites. Among them, 806 entries contained paired data of ANPP and BNPP, resulting in the 806 fBNPP data. The study sites encompassed global grasslands with latitudinal range of 54.5° S~78.9° N, longitudinal range of 157.4° W~175.8° E, and altitudes from 0 to 5168 m above sea level, covering broad climatic gradients (-17.6 to 28.8°C in mean annual temperature and 63-2052 mm in mean annual precipitation). This global database is the world's largest paired data of ANPP and BNPP field measurements in grasslands. It can be used to study the spatio-temporal patterns of NPP and its allocation, evaluate the responses of above- and below-ground carbon components to future global changes, and validate the NPP estimation by empirical or process-based models in global grasslands.

Although the uniqueness of peptides is a well-studied feature, an innovative and pioneering concept regarding the correlation of uniqueness, with the peptide amino acid sequence and the peptide length, is introduced and extensively analyzed for the first time in this work. We construct the human ""Uniquome"" by introducing the following novel peptide entities: ""Core Unique Peptide"" (CrUP) defined as the peptide whose sequence is accommodated, specifically and exclusively, only in one protein in a given proteome, and also bears the minimum length of an amino acid sequence; and, further, the ""Composite Unique Peptide"" (CmUP), the ""Family Unique Peptides"" (FUPs) and the ""Universal Unique Peptides"" (UUPs). We thoroughly analyze the human and 20 critical model organisms' proteomes. Our findings indicate that these novel peptides entities possess unique properties and crucial functions that have not been previously characterized, far beyond the identification of proteins from a single peptide, representing the ""causative agents"" for many other groups of peptides with important biological activities. Considering the complexity of proteomes, a systemic analysis of these new entities will enhance the potential for novel protein identification, functional prediction, and exploration of cellular and molecular uniqueness, setting new standards in medicine for advanced studies in deep proteomics/proteomes, and translational biology.

38733474,GEnDDn: An lncRNA-Disease Association Identification Framework Based on Dual-Net Neural Architecture and Deep Neural Network.,"Accumulating studies have demonstrated close relationships between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and diseases. Identification of new lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) enables us to better understand disease mechanisms and further provides promising insights into cancer targeted therapy and anti-cancer drug design. Here, we present an LDA prediction framework called GEnDDn based on deep learning. GEnDDn mainly comprises two steps: First, features of both lncRNAs and diseases are extracted by combining similarity computation, non-negative matrix factorization, and graph attention auto-encoder, respectively. And each lncRNA-disease pair (LDP) is depicted as a vector based on concatenation operation on the extracted features. Subsequently, unknown LDPs are classified by aggregating dual-net neural architecture and deep neural network. Using six different evaluation metrics, we found that GEnDDn surpassed four competing LDA identification methods (SDLDA, LDNFSGB, IPCARF, LDASR) on the lncRNADisease and MNDR databases under fivefold cross-validation experiments on lncRNAs, diseases, LDPs, and independent lncRNAs and independent diseases, respectively. Ablation experiments further validated the powerful LDA prediction performance of GEnDDn. Furthermore, we utilized GEnDDn to find underlying lncRNAs for lung cancer and breast cancer. The results elucidated that there may be dense linkages between IFNG-AS1 and lung cancer as well as between HIF1A-AS1 and breast cancer.

39732964,Application of artificial intelligence based on state grid ESG platform in clean energy scheduling optimization.,"The randomness and volatility of existing clean energy sources have increased the complexity of grid scheduling. To address this issue, this work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) empowered method based on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) big data platform, focusing on multi-objective scheduling optimization for clean energy. This work employs a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to enhance grid scheduling efficiency and clean energy utilization. First, the work analyzes the complexity and uncertainty challenges faced in clean energy scheduling within the current power system, highlighting the limitations of traditional methods in handling multi-objective optimization and real-time response. Consequently, the work introduces the ESG big data platform and leverages its abundant data resources and computational power to improve the scheduling decision-making process. Next, PSO is used for initial scheduling optimization and a mathematical model for clean energy scheduling optimization is constructed. To further enhance the dynamic response capability of the scheduling process, this work designs a dual-layer architecture. Among this architecture, DQN is responsible for adjusting the PSO initially optimized scheduling plan based on real-time data during the actual scheduling process, adapting it to the instantaneous change demand and renewable energy output characteristics. Finally, to verify the model's effectiveness, this work conducts simulation analyses using real data from the state grid ESG big data platform. The results indicate that this method significantly improves clean energy utilization, increasing it from 62.4% (with traditional methods) to 87.7%, while reducing scheduling costs by 22%. With the increase in communication delay, the generation time of scheduling instruction increases significantly. This is because the algorithm needs to wait longer to receive the complete grid status information, which affects the generation speed of scheduling instructions. Moreover, this method demonstrates good adaptability and stability under different load demands and clean energy supply conditions. This work introduces a novel and efficient method for clean energy scheduling optimization by integrating PSO and DQN. It contributes to the overall improvement of clean energy utilization within the State Grid and provides a theoretical and empirical foundation for further research in related fields.",False,True,,0.67036945,,esg,16.0,ok,,particle swarm optimization,dqn,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Nevertheless, scATAC-seq data is characterized by high sparsity and dimensionality, presenting significant challenges to its annotation process.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a novel method based on language model, named annATAC, which is designed for the automatic annotation of cell types in scATAC-seq data. This method primarily consists of three stages. During the pre-training stage, by training on a vast amount of unlabeled data, the model can learn the interaction relationships between peaks, thus building a preliminary understanding of the data features. Subsequently, in the fine-tuning stage, a small quantity of labeled data is utilized to conduct secondary training on the model, which enables the model to identify cell types accurately. Finally, in the prediction stage, the trained model is applied to annotate scATAC-seq data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared with other automatic annotation methods across multiple datasets, annATAC demonstrates superiority on the annotation performance. Further experiments have validated that annATAC holds great potential in identifying marker peaks and marker motifs. It is expected that annATAC will provide more profound and precise analysis outcomes for scATAC-seq research.

RiPP classes are defined by the tailoring enzyme, which can introduce a narrow range of modifications or a diverse set of alterations. In the latter category, RiPPs synthesized by radical <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes, known as RaS-RiPPs, have emerged as especially divergent. A map of all RaS-RiPP gene clusters does not yet exist. Moreover, precursor peptides remain difficult to predict using computational methods. Herein, we have addressed these challenges and report a bioinformatic atlas of RaS-RiPP gene clusters in available microbial genome sequences. Using co-occurrence of RaS enzymes and transporters from varied families as a bioinformatic hook in conjunction with an in-house code to identify precursor peptides, we generated a map of ∼15,500 RaS-RiPP gene clusters, which reveal a remarkable diversity of syntenies pointing to a tremendous range of enzymatic and natural product chemistries that remain to be explored. To assess its utility, we examined one family of gene clusters encoding a YcaO enzyme and a RaS enzyme. We find the former is noncanonical, contains an iron-sulfur cluster, and installs a novel modification, a backbone amidine into the precursor peptide. The RaS enzyme was also found to install a new modification, a C-C crosslink between the unactivated terminal δ-methyl group of Ile and a Trp side chain.

To address this, we have previously developed THINGS, a large-scale database of 1854 systematically sampled object concepts with 26,107 high-quality naturalistic images of these concepts. With THINGSplus, we significantly extend THINGS by adding concept- and image-specific norms and metadata for all 1854 concepts and one copyright-free image example per concept. Concept-specific norms were collected for the properties of real-world size, manmadeness, preciousness, liveliness, heaviness, naturalness, ability to move or be moved, graspability, holdability, pleasantness, and arousal. Further, we provide 53 superordinate categories as well as typicality ratings for all their members. Image-specific metadata includes a nameability measure, based on human-generated labels of the objects depicted in the 26,107 images. Finally, we identified one new public domain image per concept.

As IIoT relies on an open network channel for data sharing, it is vulnerable to numerous threats, including side channels, impersonation attacks, and clock synchronization issues for which device authentication becomes crucial. Researchers occasionally proposed numerous authentication protocols using conventional cryptographic methods, identity-based cryptographic techniques, or certificateless methods; however, these protocols either suffer from modular exponentiation partial private key distribution problems or are completed in four to five round-trips during authentication. Therefore, this article presents an Elliptic Curve Cryptographic (ECC)-based efficient technique that emerges as a significant solution, addressing the certificate revocations, overheads problem, and the partial private key distribution problem of identity-based cryptography, respectively.

In this context, we report a comprehensive genomics atlas of DNA-binding with one finger (Dof) family genes in 13 diverse rice genomes (five cultivated and eight rice wild-relatives) through a genome-wide scanning approach. A galore of 238 <i>Dof</i> genes, identified across the genus <i>Oryza</i>, are categorized into seven distinct subgroups by comparative phylogenetic analysis with the model plant <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Conserved motifs and gene structure analyses unveiled the prevalence of species- and subgroups-specific structural and functional diversity that is expediating with the evolutionary period.

Although, several research efforts based on machine learning (ML) methods have been made for in silico identification of PVPs, these methods have certain limitations. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new computational approach, termed SCORPION, (StaCking-based Predictior fOR Phage VIrion PrOteiNs), to accurately identify PVPs using only protein primary sequences. Specifically, we explored comprehensive 13 different feature descriptors from different aspects (i.e., compositional information, composition-transition-distribution information, position-specific information and physicochemical properties) with 10 popular ML algorithms to construct a pool of optimal baseline models. These optimal baseline models were then used to generate probabilistic features (PFs) and considered as a new feature vector. Finally, we utilized a two-step feature selection strategy to determine the optimal PF feature vector and used this feature vector to develop a stacked model (SCORPION). Both tenfold cross-validation and independent test results indicate that SCORPION achieves superior predictive performance than its constitute baseline models and existing methods.

Recent work revealed sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI to glia morphological changes in response to inflammatory stimuli, opening up exciting possibilities to characterize inflammation in a variety of preclinical models of pathologies, the great majority of them available in mice. However, there are limited resources dedicated to mouse imaging, like those required for the data processing and analysis. To fill this gap, we build a mouse MRI template of both structural and diffusion contrasts, with anatomical annotation according to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, the most detailed public resource for mouse brain investigation. To achieve a standardized resource, we use a large cohort of animals in vivo, and include animals of both sexes. To prove the utility of this resource to integrate imaging and molecular data, we demonstrate significant association between the mean diffusivity from MRI and gene expression-based glia density. To demonstrate the need of equitable sex representation, we compared across sexes the warp fields needed to match a male-based template, and our template built with both sexes. Then, we use both templates for analysing mice imaging data obtained in animals of different ages, demonstrating that using a male-based template creates spurious significant sex effects, not present otherwise.

This paper proposes an improved DCGAN model for generating welding defect samples by integrating deep convolutional neural networks to enhance the training relationship between the generator and discriminator, thus increasing the number of training samples. We introduce a lightweight DG-MobileNet model to address low accuracy in welding defect identification and poor model convergence. Dilated convolution modules and Squeeze-and-Excitation self-attention mechanisms expand the convolutional receptive field and improve feature extraction capabilities. The fully connected layer is replaced by a global average pooling layer, reducing training parameters and mitigating overfitting. Additionally, combining DropBlock technology with Batch Normalization optimizes the feature extraction process, enhancing generalization ability.

A major contributing factor to this redundancy is the duplication of bacterial taxa in a library, which can be mitigated through the use of a variety of DNA sequencing strategies and/or mass spectrometry-informed bioinformatics platforms so that the library is created with minimal phylogenetic, and thus minimal natural product overlap. IDBac is a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based bioinformatics platform used to assess overlap within collections of environmental bacterial isolates. It allows environmental isolate redundancy to be reduced while considering both phylogeny and natural product production. However, manually selecting isolates for addition to a library during this process was time intensive and left to the researcher's discretion. Here, we developed an algorithm that automates the prioritization of hundreds to thousands of environmental microorganisms in IDBac. The algorithm performs iterative reduction of natural product mass feature overlap within groups of isolates that share high homology of protein mass features.

We show that different aryl alcohol fluorophores containing the <i>o-</i>(morpholinium)methyl group for the release process allow efficient fluorophore labeling of proteins under both light- and chemical-triggering conditions. The bioconjugation in cells as well as in tissues was further demonstrated with an <i>o-</i>(morpholinium)methyl analogue containing a triggering group sensitive to reactive oxygen species.

39013340,Multi-objective context-guided consensus of a massive array of techniques for the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) inference is a fundamental task in biology and medicine, as it enables a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms of gene expression present in organisms. This bioinformatics problem has been addressed in the literature through multiple computational approaches. Techniques developed for inferring from expression data have employed Bayesian networks, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), machine learning, information theory measures and neural networks, among others. The diversity of implementations and their respective customization have led to the emergence of many tools and multiple specialized domains derived from them, understood as subsets of networks with specific characteristics that are challenging to detect a priori. This specialization has introduced significant uncertainty when choosing the most appropriate technique for a particular dataset. This proposal, named MO-GENECI, builds upon the basic idea of the previous proposal GENECI and optimizes consensus among different inference techniques, through a carefully refined multi-objective evolutionary algorithm guided by various objective functions, linked to the biological context at hand.<h4>Methods</h4>MO-GENECI has been tested on an extensive and diverse academic benchmark of 106 gene regulatory networks from multiple sources and sizes. The evaluation of MO-GENECI compared its performance to individual techniques using key metrics (AUROC and AUPR) for gene regulatory network inference. Friedman's statistical ranking provided an ordered classification, followed by non-parametric Holm tests to determine statistical significance.<h4>Results</h4>MO-GENECI's Pareto front approximation facilitates easy selection of an appropriate solution based on generic input data characteristics. The best solution consistently emerged as the winner in all statistical tests, and in many cases, the median precision solution showed no statistically significant difference compared to the winner.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MO-GENECI has not only demonstrated achieving more accurate results than individual techniques, but has also overcome the uncertainty associated with the initial choice due to its flexibility and adaptability. It is shown intelligently to select the most suitable techniques for each case.

However, for neural control of movement, they currently must be integrated with software simulating biomechanical effectors, leading to limiting impracticalities: (1) researchers must rely on two different platforms and (2) biomechanical effectors are not generally differentiable, constraining researchers to reinforcement learning algorithms despite the existence and potential biological relevance of faster training methods. To address these limitations, we developed MotorNet, an open-source Python toolbox for creating arbitrarily complex, differentiable, and biomechanically realistic effectors that can be trained on user-defined motor tasks using ANNs. MotorNet is designed to meet several goals: ease of installation, ease of use, a high-level user-friendly application programming interface, and a modular architecture to allow for flexibility in model building. MotorNet requires no dependencies outside Python, making it easy to get started with. For instance, it allows training ANNs on typically used motor control models such as a two joint, six muscle, planar arm within minutes on a typical desktop computer. MotorNet is built on PyTorch and therefore can implement any network architecture that is possible using the PyTorch framework. Consequently, it will immediately benefit from advances in artificial intelligence through PyTorch updates. Finally, it is open source, enabling users to create and share their own improvements, such as new effector and network architectures or custom task designs. MotorNet's focus on higher-order model and task design will alleviate overhead cost to initiate computational projects for new researchers by providing a standalone, ready-to-go framework, and speed up efforts of established computational teams by enabling a focus on concepts and ideas over implementation.",False,True,,0.7180913,motornet,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

39963945,DiverReef: A global database of the behavior of recreational divers and their interactions with reefs over 20 years.,"Recreational diving is an important activity in reef environments worldwide, providing income and employment for coastal communities and connecting visiting divers to these ecosystems promoting conservation and stewardship. However, if poorly managed, diving has the potential to cause detrimental effects on benthic communities via mechanical damage caused by physical contact of divers with the reef, often in the form of unintentional fin kicks resulting from poor buoyancy. Understanding diver-reef interaction patterns is important to elucidate the potential impacts of diving tourism on the reef biota. The DiverReef database provides the first public dataset on the underwater behavior of recreational divers in shallow reef environments (<25 m depth) globally and their interactions with the reef seascape and/or reef benthic sessile organisms. The dataset comprises 20 years of data (2004-2023) by observing the behavior of 2311 recreational divers in nine countries at 19 diving destinations and 176 diving sites; 93% of the observations were in marine protected areas. The data were collected through on-site observations of divers' behavior during tourism activities and their physical interactions with the reef structure and/or benthic sessile reef organisms. Observers discreetly followed divers and recorded their behavior and interactions with the reef over set periods. Interactions were described as ""contact"" or ""damage,"" the latter referring to when physical damage to a benthic organism or the reef structure was observed. Besides behavior, observers also recorded data on the type of diving activity (scuba or snorkeling), profiles of the divers (gender and experience), use of cameras by the divers, visibility, type of reef formation, and marine protection status of the dive site. The authors of this research expect that the data provided will be useful in advancing knowledge of how divers interact with reefs and in developing strategies to mitigate the potential detrimental effects of the diving industry on reef biota.

The currently widely accepted variant calling pipeline, GATK, is limited in terms of its computational speed and efficiency, which cannot meet the growing analysis needs.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we propose a fast and accurate DNASeq variant calling workflow that is purely composed of tools from LUSH toolkit. The precision and recall measurements indicate that both the LUSH and GATK pipelines exhibit high levels of consistency, with precision and recall rates exceeding 99% on the 30x NA12878 dataset.

Visual data in such cameras are usually captured in analog voltages by a sensor pixel array, and then converted to the digital domain for subsequent AI processing using analog-to-digital converters (ADC). Recent research has tried to take advantage of massively parallel low-power analog/digital computing in the form of near- and in-sensor processing, in which the AI computation is performed partly in the periphery of the pixel array and partly in a separate on-board CPU/accelerator. Unfortunately, high-resolution input images still need to be streamed between the camera and the AI processing unit, frame by frame, causing energy, bandwidth, and security bottlenecks.

Transcriptional networks can be exceptionally complex: a single transcription factor (TF) may regulate hundreds of genes, and multiple TFs may regulate a single gene-depending on the environmental conditions. Moreover, the same TF may act as an activator or repressor in distinct conditions. In turn, the activity of regulators themselves may be dependent on other TFs, as well as posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation. These traits greatly contribute to the intricate networks governing gene expression programs.In this chapter, a step-by-step guide of how to use PathoYeastract, one of several interconnecting databases within the YEASTRACT+ portal, to predict gene and genomic regulation in Candida spp. is provided. PathoYeastract contains a set of analysis tools to study regulatory associations in human pathogenic yeasts, enabling: (1) the prediction and ranking of TFs that contribute to the regulation of individual genes; (2) the prediction of the genes regulated by a given TF; and (3) the prediction and ranking of TFs that regulate a genome-wide transcriptional response. These capabilities are illustrated, respectively, with the analysis of: (1) the TF network controlling the C. glabrata QDR2 gene; (2) the regulon controlled by the C. glabrata TF Rpn4; and (3) the regulatory network controlling the C. glabrata transcriptome-wide changes induced upon exposure to the antifungal drug fluconazole.

36572713,Credible pigeon permissioned blockchain traceability platform integrated with IoT based on HACCP.,"The pigeon food production industry from breeding to processing into food for market circulation involves many stages and people, which is prone to food safety issues and difficult to regulate. To address these problems, one possible solution is to establish a traceability system. However, in traditional traceability systems, a number of stages involved and each of them provides their own data accumulated in the database. Therefore, complex traceability data are compose of too many stages easily result in confusing information for customers. Besides, centralized data storage makes data vulnerable to be tampered with. To solve these problems, hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) principles have been utilized in our work which is a comprehensive traceability system. In this work, we analyze the pigeon food production industry through HACCP principles and determine some critical control points (CCPs), including incubation, breeding, transportation, slaughtering, processing, and logistics. With the help of these CCPs, we are able to build a traceability system with critical and abundant data but not too complicated for users. To further improve the system, there are different kinds of techniques integrated into it. Firstly, a permissioned blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is selected as blockchain module to enhance trustworthiness of data. Secondly, the system contains various IoT devices for automatically collecting environmental parameter data with the aim of reducing human interference. Besides, it is worth mentioning that the proposed information management device can decrease the data entry burden. Consequently, the implementation of the traceability system increase consumers' confidence in pigeon food production.

However, the environmental datasets necessary for informed resource planning and conservation can be costly to collect and annotate. Consequently, there is a lack of publicly available datasets, particularly annotated image datasets relevant for environmental conservation, that can be used for the evaluation of machine learning algorithms to determine their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, the Time-evolving Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Advanced Open Environmental Science (TAIAO) project in New Zealand aims to provide a collection of datasets and accompanying example notebooks for their analysis. This paper showcases three New Zealand-based annotated image datasets that form part of the collection. The first dataset contains annotated images of various predator species, mainly small invasive mammals, taken using low-light camera traps predominantly at night. The second provides aerial photography of the Waikato region in New Zealand, in which stands of Kahikatea (a native New Zealand tree) have been marked up using manual segmentation.

40341180,Real time intelligent garbage monitoring and efficient collection using Yolov8 and Yolov5 deep learning models for environmental sustainability.,"Effective waste management is currently one of the most influential factors in enhancing the quality of life. Increased garbage production has been identified as a significant problem for many cities worldwide and a crucial issue for countries experiencing rapid urban population growth. According to the World Bank Organization, global waste production is projected to increase from 2.01 billion tonnes in 2018 to 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050 (Kaza et al. in What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050, The World Bank Group, Washington, DC, USA, 2018). In many cities, growing waste is the primary driver of environmental pollution. Nationally, governments have initiated several programs to improve cleanliness by developing systems that alert businesses when it's time to empty the bins. Current research proposes an enhanced, accurate, real-time object detection system to address the problem of trash accumulating around containers. This system involves numerous trash cans scattered across the city, each equipped with a low-cost device that measures the amount of trash inside. When a certain threshold is reached, the device sends a message with a unique identifier, prompting the appropriate authorities to take action. The system also triggers alerts if individuals throw trash bags outside the container or if the bin overflows, sending a message with a unique identifier to the authorities. Additionally, this paper addresses the need for efficient garbage classification while reducing computing costs to improve resource utilization. Two-stage lightweight deep learning models based on YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are adopted to significantly decrease the number of parameters and processes, thereby reducing hardware requirements. In this study, trash is first classified into primary categories, which are further subdivided. The primary categories include full trash containers, trash bags, trash outside containers, and wet trash containers. YOLOv5 is particularly effective for classifying small objects, achieving high accuracy in identifying and categorizing different types of waste products on hardware without GPU capabilities. Each main class is further subdivided using YOLOv8 to facilitate recycling. A comparative study of YOLOv8, YOLOv5, and EfficientNet models on public and newly constructed garbage datasets shows that YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 have good accuracy for most classes, with the full-trash bin class achieving the highest accuracy and the wet trash container class the lowest compared to the EfficientNet model. The results demonstrate that the system effectively addresses the reliability issues of previously proposed systems, including detecting whether a trash bin is full, identifying trash outside the bin, and ensuring proper communication with authorities for necessary actions. Further research is recommended to enhance garbage management and collection, considering target occlusion, CPU and GPU hardware optimization, and robotic integration with the proposed system.",False,True,,0.6919775,,yolov5,16.0,ok,,efficientnet,gpu,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To tackle these problems, MADNet was developed using the YOLO framework, incorporating both anchor-based and anchor-free techniques. The structure of MADNet includes CBS, C3b, Bottleneck, SPPFr, and C3 modules, and it was evaluated against YOLOv5n, YOLOv6n, YOLOv7-tiny, and YOLOv8n with consistent application methods on various open-source underwater image datasets. Using the computation cost, trained time, loss, accuracy, speed, and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance evaluation metrics, the anchor-free methods performed better than the anchor-based methods. Similarly, the overall performance score for MADNet was analyzed at 27.8%, which is higher than 20% for YOLOv8n, 18.9% for YOLOv6n, 17.8% for YOLOv5n, and 15.6% for YOLOv7-tiny.

However, a major challenge is how to integrate these experiments that acquired at different conditions. We propose a new statistical tool based on beta-binomial distributions that can construct robust gene co-regulation network (CoRegNet) across tens of thousands of experiments. Our analysis of over 12 000 experiments involving human tissues and cells shows that CoRegNet significantly outperforms existing gene co-expression-based methods. Although the majority of the genes are linearly co-regulated, we did discover an interesting set of genes that are non-linearly co-regulated; half of the time they change in the same direction and the other half they change in the opposite direction. Additionally, we identified a set of gene pairs that follows the Simpson's paradox.

To address this, we introduce pyRBDome, a pipeline for enhancing RNA-binding proteome data in silico. It aligns the experimental results with RNA-binding site (RBS) predictions from distinct machine-learning tools and integrates high-resolution structural data when available. Its statistical evaluation of RBDome data enables quick identification of likely genuine RNA-binders in experimental datasets. Furthermore, by leveraging the pyRBDome results, we have enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of RBS detection through training new ensemble machine-learning models. pyRBDome analysis of a human RBDome dataset, compared with known structural data, revealed that although UV-cross-linked amino acids were more likely to contain predicted RBSs, they infrequently bind RNA in high-resolution structures.

40439671,PLM-DBPs: enhancing plant DNA-binding protein prediction by integrating sequence-based and structure-aware protein language models.,"DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play a crucial role in gene regulation, development, and environmental responses across plants, animals, and microorganisms. Existing DBP prediction methods are largely limited to sequence information, whether through handcrafted features or sequence-based protein language models (PLMs), overlooking structural cues critical to protein function. In addition, most existing tools are trained for general DBP predictions, which are often not accurate for plant-specific DBPs due to the unique structural and functional properties of plant proteins. Our work introduces PLM-DBPs, a deep learning framework that integrates both sequence-based and structure-aware representations to enhance DBP prediction in plants. We evaluated several state-of-the-art PLMs to extract high-dimensional protein representations and experimented with various fusion strategies to validate the complementary information between the various representations. Our final model, a fusion of sequence-based and structure-aware ANN models, achieves a notable improvement in predicting DBPs in plants outperforming previous state-of-the-art models. Although sequence-based PLMs already demonstrate strong performance in DBP prediction, our findings show that the integration of structural information further enhances predictive accuracy. This underscores the complementary nature of structural representations and establishes PLM-DBPs as a robust tool for advancing plant research and agricultural innovation.

Although many methods have been developed for automated cell type annotation, they often encounter challenges such as batch effects due to variations in data distribution across platforms and species, thereby compromising their performance. To address batch effects, in this study, a pre-trained domain adaptation model based on structural similarity, named pscAdapt, is proposed for cell type annotation. Specifically, a pre-trained strategy is employed to initialize model parameters to learn the data distribution of source domain. This strategy is also combined with an adversarial learning strategy to train the domain adaptation network for achieving domain level alignment and reducing domain discrepancy. Furthermore, to better distinguish different types of cells, a structural similarity loss is designed, aiming to shorten distances between cells of the same type and increase distances between cells of different types in feature space, thus achieving cell level alignment and enhancing the discriminability of cell types.

Along this line, in order to analyze transcriptomic data, several computational feature selection (i.e., gene selection) methods have been proposed. On the other hand, uncovering the core functions of the selected genes provides a deep understanding of diseases. In order to address this problem, biological domain knowledge-based feature selection methods have been proposed. Unlike computational gene selection approaches, these domain knowledge-based methods take the underlying biology into account and integrate knowledge from external biological resources. Gene Ontology (GO) is one such biological resource that provides ontology terms for defining the molecular function, cellular component, and biological process of the gene product. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we developed a tool named GeNetOntology which performs GO-based feature selection for gene expression data analysis. In the proposed approach, the process of Grouping, Scoring, and Modeling (G-S-M) is used to identify significant GO terms. GO information has been used as the grouping information, which has been embedded into a machine learning (ML) algorithm to select informative ontology terms. The genes annotated with the selected ontology terms have been used in the training part to carry out the classification task of the ML model. The output is an important set of ontologies for the two-class classification task applied to gene expression data for a given phenotype. <b>Results:</b> Our approach has been tested on 11 different gene expression datasets, and the results showed that GeNetOntology successfully identified important disease-related ontology terms to be used in the classification model. <b>Discussion:</b> GeNetOntology will assist geneticists and scientists to identify a range of disease-related genes and ontologies in transcriptomic data analysis, and it will also help doctors design diagnosis platforms and improve patient treatment plans.",False,True,,0.7064029,genetontology,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,GeNetOntology,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

Additionally, understanding the relationships between different variants, and the tools used to analyze them, have evolved over time, further complicating efforts to harmonize this information. The Universal Y-SNP Database (UYSD) marks a substantial advancement by providing a comprehensive and accessible platform for Y-SNP and haplogroup data from populations around the world. UYSD harmonizes diverse datasets into a unified repository, facilitating the exploration of global Y-chromosomal variation. The platform handles data generated with both high- and low-throughput technology and is compatible with the automated analysis software tool, Yleaf v3. Key functionalities include the ability to: i) visualize haplogroup distributions on an interactive world map, ii) estimate haplogroup frequencies in geographic regions with sparse data through interpolation, and iii) display detailed phylogenetic trees of Y-chromosomal haplogroups. Currently, UYSD encompasses data from over 6,600 males across 27 populations. This dataset largely aligns with known global Y-haplogroup patterns, but also reveals unexplored finer-scale geographic variations. While the present dataset is largely European-centered, UYSD is designed for ongoing expansion by the scientific community, aiming to include more global data and higher-resolution population sequencing data.

36458799,NLM-Chem-BC7: manually annotated full-text resources for chemical entity annotation and indexing in biomedical articles.,"The automatic recognition of chemical names and their corresponding database identifiers in biomedical text is an important first step for many downstream text-mining applications. The task is even more challenging when considering the identification of these entities in the article's full text and, furthermore, the identification of candidate substances for that article's metadata [Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) article indexing]. The National Library of Medicine (NLM)-Chem track at BioCreative VII aimed to foster the development of algorithms that can predict with high quality the chemical entities in the biomedical literature and further identify the chemical substances that are candidates for article indexing. As a result of this challenge, the NLM-Chem track produced two comprehensive, manually curated corpora annotated with chemical entities and indexed with chemical substances: the chemical identification corpus and the chemical indexing corpus. The NLM-Chem BioCreative VII (NLM-Chem-BC7) Chemical Identification corpus consists of 204 full-text PubMed Central (PMC) articles, fully annotated for chemical entities by 12 NLM indexers for both span (i.e. named entity recognition) and normalization (i.e. entity linking) using MeSH. This resource was used for the training and testing of the Chemical Identification task to evaluate the accuracy of algorithms in predicting chemicals mentioned in recently published full-text articles. The NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus consists of 1333 recently published PMC articles, equipped with chemical substance indexing by manual experts at the NLM. This resource was used for the evaluation of the Chemical Indexing task, which evaluated the accuracy of algorithms in predicting the chemicals that should be indexed, i.e. appear in the listing of MeSH terms for the document. This set was further enriched after the challenge in two ways: (i) 11 NLM indexers manually verified each of the candidate terms appearing in the prediction results of the challenge participants, but not in the MeSH indexing, and the chemical indexing terms appearing in the MeSH indexing list, but not in the prediction results, and (ii) the challenge organizers algorithmically merged the chemical entity annotations in the full text for all predicted chemical entities and used a statistical approach to keep those with the highest degree of confidence. As a result, the NLM-Chem-BC7 Chemical Indexing corpus is a gold-standard corpus for chemical indexing of journal articles and a silver-standard corpus for chemical entity identification in full-text journal articles. Together, these resources are currently the most comprehensive resources for chemical entity recognition, and we demonstrate improvements in the chemical entity recognition algorithms.

37589308,"Lessons learned to boost a bioinformatics knowledge base reusability, the Bgee experience.","<h4>Background</h4>Enhancing interoperability of bioinformatics knowledge bases is a high-priority requirement to maximize data reusability and thus increase their utility such as the return on investment for biomedical research. A knowledge base may provide useful information for life scientists and other knowledge bases, but it only acquires exchange value once the knowledge base is (re)used, and without interoperability, the utility lies dormant.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we discuss several approaches to boost interoperability depending on the interoperable parts. The findings are driven by several real-world scenario examples that were mostly implemented by Bgee, a well-established gene expression knowledge base. To better justify the findings are transferable, for each Bgee interoperability experience, we also highlight similar implementations by major bioinformatics knowledge bases. Moreover, we discuss ten general main lessons learned. These lessons can be applied in the context of any bioinformatics knowledge base to foster data reusability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work provides pragmatic methods and transferable skills to promote reusability of bioinformatics knowledge bases by focusing on interoperability.",False,True,,0.71215564,,bgee,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Interpreting enzyme functions and mining new structures of terpenoids could be inspired by the cheminformatic and chemotaxonomic analysis, whereas it is hampered by the incompleteness of available data for terpenoids. Here a dedicated terpenoids database, TeroMOL, is developed to collect more than 170 000 terpenoids and their derivatives annotated with reported biological sources, along with a user-friendly and freely accessible webserver to visualise and analyse the terpenoids skeletons and organism sources. The quantitative distributions as well as the qualitative trends between terpenoid skeletons and organism sources in plant kingdom are revealed from a chemotaxonomic view, while no comparisons are attempted due to the inherent data biases. Nevertheless, the terpenoid chemomarkers in several organisms are discussed based on the available data with highly enriched and exclusive carbon skeletons. We believe that the TeroMOL database and its accessory computational tools will be very promising for exploring the chemical space and biological sources of terpenoids, and assisting the terpenoid research community in the future.",False,True,,0.72828597,teromol,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40063348,VITALdb: to select the best viroinformatics tools for a desired virus or application.,"The recent pandemics of viral diseases, COVID-19/mpox (humans) and lumpy skin disease (cattle), have kept us glued to viral research. These pandemics along with the recent human metapneumovirus outbreak have exposed the urgency for early diagnosis of viral infections, vaccine development, and discovery of novel antiviral drugs and therapeutics. To support this, there is an armamentarium of virus-specific computational tools that are currently available. VITALdb (VIroinformatics Tools and ALgorithms database) is a resource of ~360 viroinformatics tools encompassing all major viruses (SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, papillomavirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis virus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, etc.) and several diverse applications [structural and functional annotation, antiviral peptides development, subspecies characterization, recognition of viral recombination, inhibitors identification, phylogenetic analysis, virus-host prediction, viral metagenomics, detection of mutation(s), primer designing, etc.]. Resources, tools, and other utilities mentioned in this article will not only facilitate further developments in the realm of viroinformatics but also provide tremendous fillip to translate fundamental knowledge into applied research.

39522681,PAMPHLET: PAM Prediction HomoLogous-Enhancement Toolkit for precise PAM prediction in CRISPR-Cas systems.,"CRISPR-Cas technology has revolutionized our ability to understand and engineer organisms, evolving from a singular Cas9 model to a diverse CRISPR toolbox. A critical bottleneck in developing new Cas proteins is identifying protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. Due to the limitations of experimental methods, bioinformatics approaches have become essential. However, existing PAM prediction programs are limited by the small number of spacers in CRISPR-Cas systems, resulting in low accuracy. To address this, we develop PAMPHLET, a pipeline that uses homology searches to identify additional spacers, significantly increasing the number of spacers up to 18-fold. PAMPHLET is validated on 20 CRISPR-Cas systems and successfully predicts PAM sequences for 18 protospacers. These predictions are further validated using the DocMF platform, which characterizes protein-DNA recognition patterns via next-generation sequencing. The high consistency between PAMPHLET predictions and DocMF results for Cas proteins demonstrates the potential of PAMPHLET to enhance PAM sequence prediction accuracy, expedite the discovery process, and accelerate the development of CRISPR tools.",False,True,,0.70929587,,pamphlet,16.0,ok,,,docmf,spacy,0.0,PAMPHLET,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1
39555474,Easy-MODA: Simplifying standardised registration of scientific simulation workflows through MODA template guidelines powered by the Enalos Cloud Platform.,"Modelling Data (MODA) reporting guidelines have been proposed for common terminology and for recording metadata for physics-based materials modelling and simulations in a CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA 17284:2018). Their purpose is similar to that of the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model report form (QMRF) that aims to increase industry and regulatory confidence in QSAR models, but for a wider range of model types. Recently, the WorldFAIR project's nanomaterials case study suggested that both QMRF and MODA templates are an important means to enhance compliance of nanoinformatics models, and their underpinning datasets, with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Despite the advances in computational modelling of materials properties and phenomena, regulatory uptake of predictive models has been slow. This is, in part, due to concerns about lack of validation of complex models and lack of documentation of scientific simulations. The models are often complex, output can be hardware- and software-dependent, and there is a lack of shared standards. Despite advocating for standardised and transparent documentation of simulation protocols through its templates, the MODA guidelines are rarely used in practice by modellers because of a lack of tools for automating their creation, sharing, and storage. They also suffer from a paucity of user guidance on their use to document different types of models and systems. Such tools exist for the more well-established QMRF and have aided widespread implementation of QMRFs. To address this gap, a simplified procedure and online tool, Easy-MODA, has been developed to guide users through MODA creation for physics-based and data-based models, and their various combinations. Easy-MODA is available as a web-tool on the Enalos Cloud Platform (https://www.enaloscloud.novamechanics.com/insight/moda/). The tool streamlines the creation of detailed MODA documentation, even for complex multi-model workflows, and facilitates the registration of MODA workflows and documentation in a database, thereby increasing their Findability and thus Re-usability. This enhances communication, interoperability, and reproducibility in multiscale materials modelling and improves trust in the models through improved documentation. The use of the Easy-MODA tool is exemplified by a case study for nanotoxicity evaluation, involving interlinked models and data transformation, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool in integrating complex computational methodologies and its significant role in improving the FAIRness of scientific simulations.",False,True,,0.7059574,easy-moda | enalos cloud platform,,16.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Easy-MODA,False,0.0,False,False,https://www.enaloscloud.novamechanics.com/insight/moda/ | http://www.enaloscloud.novamechanics.com/insight/moda/,https://www.enaloscloud.novamechanics.com/insight/moda/,True,...lable as a web-tool on the Enalos Cloud Platform (https://www.enaloscloud.novamechanics.com/insight/moda/).

38769143,Reproducible mass spectrometry data processing and compound annotation in MZmine 3.,"Untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) experiments produce complex, multidimensional data that are practically impossible to investigate manually. For this reason, computational pipelines are needed to extract relevant information from raw spectral data and convert it into a more comprehensible format. Depending on the sample type and/or goal of the study, a variety of MS platforms can be used for such analysis. MZmine is an open-source software for the processing of raw spectral data generated by different MS platforms. Examples include liquid chromatography-MS, gas chromatography-MS and MS-imaging. These data might typically be associated with various applications including metabolomics and lipidomics. Moreover, the third version of the software, described herein, supports the processing of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) data. The present protocol provides three distinct procedures to perform feature detection and annotation of untargeted MS data produced by different instrumental setups: liquid chromatography-(IMS-)MS, gas chromatography-MS and (IMS-)MS imaging. For training purposes, example datasets are provided together with configuration batch files (i.e., list of processing steps and parameters) to allow new users to easily replicate the described workflows. Depending on the number of data files and available computing resources, we anticipate this to take between 2 and 24 h for new MZmine users and nonexperts. Within each procedure, we provide a detailed description for all processing parameters together with instructions/recommendations for their optimization.

38261340,GMFGRN: a matrix factorization and graph neural network approach for gene regulatory network inference.,"The recent advances of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled reliable profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing opportunities for accurate inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) on scRNA-seq data. Most methods for inferring GRNs suffer from the inability to eliminate transitive interactions or necessitate expensive computational resources. To address these, we present a novel method, termed GMFGRN, for accurate graph neural network (GNN)-based GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. GMFGRN employs GNN for matrix factorization and learns representative embeddings for genes. For transcription factor-gene pairs, it utilizes the learned embeddings to determine whether they interact with each other. The extensive suite of benchmarking experiments encompassing eight static scRNA-seq datasets alongside several state-of-the-art methods demonstrated mean improvements of 1.9 and 2.5% over the runner-up in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). In addition, across four time-series datasets, maximum enhancements of 2.4 and 1.3% in AUROC and AUPRC were observed in comparison to the runner-up. Moreover, GMFGRN requires significantly less training time and memory consumption, with time and memory consumed <10% compared to the second-best method. These findings underscore the substantial potential of GMFGRN in the inference of GRNs.

38785923,GateView: A Multi-Omics Platform for Gene Feature Analysis of Virus Receptors within Human Normal Tissues and Tumors.,"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on cell surface receptor molecules to complete the first step of invading host cells. The experimental method for virus receptor screening is time-consuming, and receptor molecules have been identified for less than half of known viruses. This study collected known human viruses and their receptor molecules. Through bioinformatics analysis, common characteristics of virus receptor molecules (including sequence, expression, mutation, etc.) were obtained to study why these membrane proteins are more likely to become virus receptors. An in-depth analysis of the cataloged virus receptors revealed several noteworthy findings. Compared to other membrane proteins, human virus receptors generally exhibited higher expression levels and lower sequence conservation. These receptors were found in multiple tissues, with certain tissues and cell types displaying significantly higher expression levels. While most receptor molecules showed noticeable age-related variations in expression across different tissues, only a limited number of them exhibited gender-related differences in specific tissues. Interestingly, in contrast to normal tissues, virus receptors showed significant dysregulation in various types of tumors, particularly those associated with dsRNA and retrovirus receptors. Finally, GateView, a multi-omics platform, was established to analyze the gene features of virus receptors in human normal tissues and tumors.

35148686,ProtPlat: an efficient pre-training platform for protein classification based on FastText.,"<h4>Background</h4>For the past decades, benefitting from the rapid growth of protein sequence data in public databases, a lot of machine learning methods have been developed to predict physicochemical properties or functions of proteins using amino acid sequence features. However, the prediction performance often suffers from the lack of labeled data. In recent years, pre-training methods have been widely studied to address the small-sample issue in computer vision and natural language processing fields, while specific pre-training techniques for protein sequences are few.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we propose a pre-training platform for representing protein sequences, called ProtPlat, which uses the Pfam database to train a three-layer neural network, and then uses specific training data from downstream tasks to fine-tune the model. ProtPlat can learn good representations for amino acids, and at the same time achieve efficient classification. We conduct experiments on three protein classification tasks, including the identification of type III secreted effectors, the prediction of subcellular localization, and the recognition of signal peptides. The experimental results show that the pre-training can enhance model performance effectively and ProtPlat is competitive to the state-of-the-art predictors, especially for small datasets. We implement the ProtPlat platform as a web service ( https://compbio.sjtu.edu.cn/protplat ) that is accessible to the public.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To enhance the feature representation of protein amino acid sequences and improve the performance of sequence-based classification tasks, we develop ProtPlat, a general platform for the pre-training of protein sequences, which is featured by a large-scale supervised training based on Pfam database and an efficient learning model, FastText. The experimental results of three downstream classification tasks demonstrate the efficacy of ProtPlat.",False,True,,0.72338605,protplat,,16.0,ok,,a large-scale,pfam,spacy,0.0,ProtPlat,False,0.0,True,False,https://compbio.sjtu.edu.cn/protplat,https://compbio.sjtu.edu.cn/protplat,True,...mplement the ProtPlat platform as a web service ( https://compbio.sjtu.edu.cn/protplat ) that is accessible to the public.<h4>Conclusion...,1
37393296,FAIR-Checker: supporting digital resource findability and reuse with Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Web standards.,"The current rise of Open Science and Reproducibility in the Life Sciences requires the creation of rich, machine-actionable metadata in order to better share and reuse biological digital resources such as datasets, bioinformatics tools, training materials, etc. For this purpose, FAIR principles have been defined for both data and metadata and adopted by large communities, leading to the definition of specific metrics. However, automatic FAIRness assessment is still difficult because computational evaluations frequently require technical expertise and can be time-consuming. As a first step to address these issues, we propose FAIR-Checker, a web-based tool to assess the FAIRness of metadata presented by digital resources. FAIR-Checker offers two main facets: a ""Check"" module providing a thorough metadata evaluation and recommendations, and an ""Inspect"" module which assists users in improving metadata quality and therefore the FAIRness of their resource. FAIR-Checker leverages Semantic Web standards and technologies such as SPARQL queries and SHACL constraints to automatically assess FAIR metrics. Users are notified of missing, necessary, or recommended metadata for various resource categories. We evaluate FAIR-Checker in the context of improving the FAIRification of individual resources, through better metadata, as well as analyzing the FAIRness of more than 25 thousand bioinformatics software descriptions.",False,True,,0.7187038,fair-checker,,16.0,ok,,fairification,,spacy,0.0,FAIR-Checker,True,3.0,True,True,,,False,,1

With the aim to facilitate this process, we reviewed the published best practices in GDPR compliance. Then, we customized the findings to fit into the DH domain and created a toolkit for GDPR implementation and compliance. The Activity Planning Tool (APT) is provided as an example of how this toolkit could be utilized in new application development in mobile health in Austria.

Max record number in each query is too low. Also, repeating the name of stars in different records is a big problem. Hence, we wrote a script and executed it at different distances. Also, we wrote a program for grouping data and deleting repeated records. The article represents the distance, temperature, and Redshift of 93,060 nearby space objects, including stars, quasars, white dwarfs, and carbon stars. The objects' temperatures are between 671 and 99,575 K, and the distances of the objects are between 413.13 and 0.5 (mas). We have retrieved this information from almost 2,200,000 records. In addition, we have added two new columns for providing equivalent distances in the light year and peak frequency of the black body. All data are in a simple table in a Microsoft Access Database and a copy in the Excel. We have excluded data from space objects whose temperature doesn't exist and space objects whose Redshift is less than zero (Blueshift). The SIMBAD Astronomical Database provides the distance of the space objects using the parallax method. The advantage of choosing nearby stars is using the Parallax method for calculating the distance of the stars, which is more precise than other methods. The Parallax data help us to investigate space objects in a no-expansion universe. We can use this data in many different investigations. Finding a correlation between temperature and Redshift of stars, investigating the nature of nearby space objects with Redshift higher than 1, and investigating the origin of the Quantum Redshift in a no expansion universe using parallax distance are some useful usages of this data.",False,True,,0.65623564,,simbad,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

37738189,MetNetComp: Database for Minimal and Maximal Gene-Deletion Strategies for Growth-Coupled Production of Genome-Scale Metabolic Networks.,"Growth-coupled production, in which cell growth forces the production of target metabolites, plays an essential role in the production of substances by microorganisms. The strains are first designed using computational simulation and then validated by biological experiments. In the simulations, gene-deletion strategies are often necessary because many metabolites are not produced in the natural state of the microorganisms. However, such information is not available for many metabolites owing to the requirement of heavy computation, especially when many gene deletions are required for genome-scale models. A database for such information will be helpful. However, developing such a database is not straightforward because heavy computation and the existence of replaceable genes render difficulty in efficient enumeration.

35100387,FlyPhoneDB: an integrated web-based resource for cell-cell communication prediction in Drosophila.,"Multicellular organisms rely on cell-cell communication to exchange information necessary for developmental processes and metabolic homeostasis. Cell-cell communication pathways can be inferred from transcriptomic datasets based on ligand-receptor expression. Recently, data generated from single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled ligand-receptor interaction predictions at an unprecedented resolution. While computational methods are available to infer cell-cell communication in vertebrates such a tool does not yet exist for Drosophila. Here, we generated a high-confidence list of ligand-receptor pairs for the major fly signaling pathways and developed FlyPhoneDB, a quantification algorithm that calculates interaction scores to predict ligand-receptor interactions between cells. At the FlyPhoneDB user interface, results are presented in a variety of tabular and graphical formats to facilitate biological interpretation. To illustrate that FlyPhoneDB can effectively identify active ligands and receptors to uncover cell-cell communication events, we applied FlyPhoneDB to Drosophila single-cell RNA sequencing data sets from adult midgut, abdomen, and blood, and demonstrate that FlyPhoneDB can readily identify previously characterized cell-cell communication pathways. Altogether, FlyPhoneDB is an easy-to-use framework that can be used to predict cell-cell communication between cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing data in Drosophila.",False,True,,0.7158175,flyphonedb,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,FlyPhoneDB,True,4.0,True,True,,,False,,1

Hence, knowledge of the metabolome, alongside its populace, would help us understand the functionality of a community and also predict how it will change in atypical conditions. Methods that employ low-cost metagenomic sequencing data can predict the metabolic potential of a community, that is, its ability to produce or utilize specific metabolites. These, in turn, can potentially serve as markers of biochemical pathways that are associated with different communities. We developed MMIP (Microbiome Metabolome Integration Platform), a web-based analytical and predictive tool that can be used to compare the taxonomic content, diversity variation and the metabolic potential between two sets of microbial communities from targeted amplicon sequencing data. MMIP is capable of highlighting statistically significant taxonomic, enzymatic and metabolic attributes as well as learning-based features associated with one group in comparison with another. Furthermore, MMIP can predict linkages among species or groups of microbes in the community, specific enzyme profiles, compounds or metabolites associated with such a group of organisms. With MMIP, we aim to provide a user-friendly, online web server for performing key microbiome-associated analyses of targeted amplicon sequencing data, predicting metabolite signature, and using learning-based linkage analysis, without the need for initial metabolomic analysis, and thereby helping in hypothesis generation.",False,True,,0.726496,microbiome metabolome integration platform,mmip,16.0,conflict,mmip | microbiome metabolome integration platform,,,spacy,0.0,Microbiome Metabolome Integration Platform,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1
36755242,pLMSNOSite: an ensemble-based approach for predicting protein S-nitrosylation sites by integrating supervised word embedding and embedding from pre-trained protein language model.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein S-nitrosylation (SNO) plays a key role in transferring nitric oxide-mediated signals in both animals and plants and has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating protein functions and cell signaling of all main classes of protein. It is involved in several biological processes including immune response, protein stability, transcription regulation, post translational regulation, DNA damage repair, redox regulation, and is an emerging paradigm of redox signaling for protection against oxidative stress. The development of robust computational tools to predict protein SNO sites would contribute to further interpretation of the pathological and physiological mechanisms of SNO.<h4>Results</h4>Using an intermediate fusion-based stacked generalization approach, we integrated embeddings from supervised embedding layer and contextualized protein language model (ProtT5) and developed a tool called pLMSNOSite (protein language model-based SNO site predictor). On an independent test set of experimentally identified SNO sites, pLMSNOSite achieved values of 0.340, 0.735 and 0.773 for MCC, sensitivity and specificity respectively. These results show that pLMSNOSite performs better than the compared approaches for the prediction of S-nitrosylation sites.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Together, the experimental results suggest that pLMSNOSite achieves significant improvement in the prediction performance of S-nitrosylation sites and represents a robust computational approach for predicting protein S-nitrosylation sites. pLMSNOSite could be a useful resource for further elucidation of SNO and is publicly available at https://github.com/KCLabMTU/pLMSNOSite .",False,True,,0.647308,plmsnosite,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,pLMSNOSite,False,0.0,True,False,https://github.com/KCLabMTU/pLMSNOSite,,False,,1

38770571,PIPI2: Sensitive Tag-Based Database Search to Identify Peptides with Multiple Post-translational Modifications.,"Peptide identification is important in bottom-up proteomics. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are crucial in regulating cellular activities. Many database search methods have been developed to identify peptides with PTMs and characterize the PTM patterns. However, the PTMs on peptides hinder the peptide identification rate and the PTM characterization precision, especially for peptides with multiple PTMs. To address this issue, we present a sensitive open search engine, PIPI2, with much better performance on peptides with multiple PTMs than other methods. With a greedy approach, we simplify the PTM characterization problem into a linear one, which enables characterizing multiple PTMs on one peptide. On the simulation data sets with up to four PTMs per peptide, PIPI2 identified over 90% of the spectra, at least 56% more than five other competitors. PIPI2 also characterized these PTM patterns with the highest precision of 77%, demonstrating a significant advantage in handling peptides with multiple PTMs. In the real applications, PIPI2 identified 30% to 88% more peptides with PTMs than its competitors.",False,True,,0.7126893,,pipi2,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,PIPI2,True,5.0,True,True,,,False,,1

35346379,Improving reusability along the data life cycle: a regulatory circuits case study.,"<h4>Background</h4>In life sciences, there has been a long-standing effort of standardization and integration of reference datasets and databases. Despite these efforts, many studies data are provided using specific and non-standard formats. This hampers the capacity to reuse the studies data in other pipelines, the capacity to reuse the pipelines results in other studies, and the capacity to enrich the data with additional information. The Regulatory Circuits project is one of the largest efforts for integrating human cell genomics data to predict tissue-specific transcription factor-genes interaction networks. In spite of its success, it exhibits the usual shortcomings limiting its update, its reuse (as a whole or partially), and its extension with new data samples. To address these limitations, the resource has previously been integrated in an RDF triplestore so that TF-gene interaction networks could be generated with two SPARQL queries. However, this triplestore did not store the computed networks and did not integrate metadata about tissues and samples, therefore limiting the reuse of this dataset. In particular, it does not enable to reuse only a portion of Regulatory Circuits if a study focuses on a subset of the tissues, nor to combine the samples described in the datasets with samples from other studies. Overall, these limitations advocate for the design of a complete, flexible and reusable representation of the Regulatory Circuits dataset based on Semantic Web technologies.<h4>Results</h4>We provide a modular RDF representation of the Regulatory Circuits, called Linked Extended Regulatory Circuits (LERC). It consists in (i) descriptions of biological and experimental context mapped to the references databases, (ii) annotations about TF-gene interactions at the sample level for 808 samples, (iii) annotations about TF-gene interactions at the tissue level for 394 tissues, (iv) metadata connecting the knowledge graphs cited above. LERC is based on a modular organisation into 1,205 RDF named graphs for representing the biological data, the sample-specific and the tissue-specific networks, and the corresponding metadata. In total it contains 3,910,794,050 triples and is available as a SPARQL endpoint.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The flexible and modular architecture of LERC supports biologically-relevant SPARQL queries. It allows an easy and fast querying of the resources related to the initial Regulatory Circuits datasets and facilitates its reuse in other studies.

37033947,PathwayKO: An integrated platform for deciphering the systems-level signaling pathways.,"Systems characterization of immune landscapes in health, disease and clinical intervention cases is a priority in modern medicine. High-throughput transcriptomes accumulated from gene-knockout (KO) experiments are crucial for deciphering target KO signaling pathways that are impaired by KO genes at the systems-level. There is a demand for integrative platforms. This article describes the PathwayKO platform, which has integrated state-of-the-art methods of pathway enrichment analysis, statistics analysis, and visualizing analysis to conduct cutting-edge integrative pathway analysis in a pipeline fashion and decipher target KO signaling pathways at the systems-level. We focus on describing the methodology, principles and application features of PathwayKO. First, we demonstrate that the PathwayKO platform can be utilized to comprehensively analyze real-world mouse KO transcriptomes (GSE22873 and GSE24327), which reveal systemic mechanisms underlying the innate immune responses triggered by non-infectious extensive hepatectomy (2 hours after 85% liver resection surgery) and infectious CASP-model sepsis (12 hours after CASP-model surgery). Strikingly, our results indicate that both cases hit the same core set of 21 KO MyD88-associated signaling pathways, including the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, the NFκB signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer, alongside the pathways of bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. These findings suggest common fundamental mechanisms between these immune responses and offer informative cues that warrant future experimental validation. Such mechanisms in mice may serve as models for humans and ultimately guide formulating the research paradigms and composite strategies to reduce the high mortality rates of patients in intensive care units who have undergone successful traumatic surgical treatments. Second, we demonstrate that the PathwayKO platform model-based assessments can effectively evaluate the performance difference of pathway analysis methods when benchmarked with a collection of proper transcriptomes. Together, such advances in methods for deciphering biological insights at the systems-level may benefit the fields of bioinformatics, systems immunology and beyond.",False,True,,0.64280176,pathwayko,,16.0,ok,,an integrated platform for deciphering the systems-level signaling pathways,nfκb,spacy,0.0,PathwayKO,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

38213714,Human_SNP_TATAdb: a database of SNPs that statistically significantly change the affinity of the TATA-binding protein to human gene promoters: genome-wide analysis and use cases.,"It was previously shown that the expression levels of human genes positively correlate with TBP affinity for the promoters of these genes. In turn, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human gene promoters can affect TBP affinity for DNA and, as a consequence, gene expression. The Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS (ICG) has developed a method for predicting TBP affinity for gene promoters based on a three-step binding mecha- nism: (1) TBP slides along DNA, (2) TBP stops at the binding site, and (3) the TBP-promoter complex is fixed due to DNA helix bending. The method showed a high correlation of theoretical predictions with measured values during repeated experimental testing by independent groups of researchers. This model served as a base for other ICG web services, SNP_TATA_Z-tester and SNP_TATA_Comparator, which make a statistical assessment of the SNP-induced change in the affinity of TBP binding to the human gene promoter and help predict changes in expression that may be associated with a genetic predisposition to diseases or phenotypic features of the organism. In this work, we integrated into a single database information about SNPs in human gene promoters obtained by automatic extrac- tion from various heterogeneous data sources, as well as the estimates of TBP affinity for the promoter obtained using the three-step binding model and predicting their effect on gene expression for wild-type promoters and promoters with SNPs. We have shown that Human_SNP_TATAdb can be used for annotation and identification of candidate SNP markers of diseases. The results of a genome-wide data analysis are presented, including the distri- bution of genes with respect to the number of transcripts, the distribution of SNPs affecting TBP-DNA affinity with respect to positions within promoters, as well as patterns linking TBP affinity for the promoter, the specificity of the TBP binding site for the promoter and other characteristics of promoters.

To this end, this paper aims to propose KGrAt-Net, which is a Knowledge Graph Attention Network text classifier. For the first time, it applies the knowledge graph attention network to perform Automatic Personality Prediction (APP), according to the Big Five personality traits. After performing some preprocessing activities, it first tries to acquire a knowing-full representation of the knowledge behind the concepts in the input text by building its equivalent knowledge graph. A knowledge graph collects interlinked descriptions of concepts, entities, and relationships in a machine-readable form. Practically, it provides a machine-readable cognitive understanding of concepts and semantic relationships among them. Then, applying the attention mechanism, it attempts to pay attention to the most relevant parts of the graph to predict the personality traits of the input text. We used 2467 essays from the Essays Dataset. The results demonstrated that KGrAt-Net considerably improved personality prediction accuracies (up to 70.26% on average).

40425649,PathoGraph: A Graph-Based Method for Standardized Representation of Pathology Knowledge.,"Pathology data, primarily consisting of slides and diagnostic reports, inherently contain knowledge that is pivotal for advancing data-driven biomedical research and clinical practice.

To systematically organize pathology knowledge for its computational use, we propose PathoGraph, a knowledge representation method that describes pathology knowledge in a graph-based format. PathoGraph can represent: (1) pathological entities' types and morphological features; (2) the composition, spatial arrangements, and dynamic behaviors associated with pathological phenotypes; and (3) the differential diagnostic approaches used by pathologists. By applying PathoGraph to neoplastic diseases, we illustrate its ability to comprehensively and structurally capture multi-scale disease characteristics alongside pathologists' expertise. Furthermore, we validate its computational utility by demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale automated PathoGraph construction, showing performance improvements in downstream deep learning tasks, and presenting two illustrative use cases that highlight its clinical potential.

35576001,SKIOME Project: a curated collection of skin microbiome datasets enriched with study-related metadata.,"Large amounts of data from microbiome-related studies have been (and are currently being) deposited on international public databases. These datasets represent a valuable resource for the microbiome research community and could serve future researchers interested in integrating multiple datasets into powerful meta-analyses. However, this huge amount of data lacks harmonization and it is far from being completely exploited in its full potential to build a foundation that places microbiome research at the nexus of many subdisciplines within and beyond biology. Thus, it urges the need for data accessibility and reusability, according to findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) principles, as supported by National Microbiome Data Collaborative and FAIR Microbiome. To tackle the challenge of accelerating discovery and advances in skin microbiome research, we collected, integrated and organized existing microbiome data resources from human skin 16S rRNA amplicon-sequencing experiments. We generated a comprehensive collection of datasets, enriched in metadata, and organized this information into data frames ready to be integrated into microbiome research projects and advanced post-processing analyses, such as data science applications (e.g. machine learning). Furthermore, we have created a data retrieval and curation framework built on three different stages to maximize the retrieval of datasets and metadata associated with them. Lastly, we highlighted some caveats regarding metadata retrieval and suggested ways to improve future metadata submissions. Overall, our work resulted in a curated skin microbiome datasets collection accompanied by a state-of-the-art analysis of the last 10 years of the skin microbiome field.

35084488,New resources for the Drosophila 4th chromosome: FRT101F enabled mitotic clones and Bloom syndrome helicase enabled meiotic recombination.,"Genes on the long arm of the Drosophila melanogaster 4th chromosome are difficult to study because the chromosome lacks mitotic and meiotic recombination. Without recombination numerous standard methods of genetic analysis are impossible. Here, we report new resources for the 4th. For mitotic recombination, we generated a chromosome with an FRT very near the centromere in 101F and a derivative that carries FRT101F with a distal ubiquitously expressed GAL80 transgene. This pair of chromosomes enables both unmarked and MARCM clones. For meiotic recombination, we demonstrate that a Bloom syndrome helicase and recombination defective double mutant genotype can create recombinant 4th chromosomes via female meiosis. All strains will be available to the community via the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. Additional resources for studies of the 4th are in preparation and will also be made available. The goal of the 4th Chromosome Resource Project is to accelerate the genetic analysis of protein-coding genes on the 4th, including the 44 genes with no demonstrated function.

In plants, carotenoids provide crucial functions in photosynthesis and photoprotection. Furthermore, carotenoids also serve as precursors to apocarotenoids, which are derived through enzymatic and non-enzymatic cleavage reactions. Apocarotenoids encompass a diverse set of compounds, including hormones, growth regulators, and signaling molecules which play vital roles in pathways associated with plant development, stress responses, and plant-organismic interactions. Regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis indirectly influences the formation of apocarotenoids and bioactive effects on target pathways. Recent discovery of a plethora of new bioactive apocarotenoids across kingdoms has increased interest in expanding knowledge of the breadth of apocarotenoid function and regulation. In this review, we provide insights into the regulation of carotenogenesis, specifically linked to the biosynthesis of apocarotenoid precursors.

39213277,IdeNet: Making Neural Network Identify Camouflaged Objects Like Creatures.,"Camouflaged objects often blend in with their surroundings, making the perception of a camouflaged object a more complex procedure. However, most neural-network-based methods that simulate the visual information processing pathway of creatures only roughly define the general process, which deficiently reproduces the process of identifying camouflaged objects. How to make modeled neural networks perceive camouflaged objects as effectively as creatures is a significant topic that deserves further consideration. After meticulous analysis of biological visual information processing, we propose an end-to-end prudent and comprehensive neural network, termed IdeNet, to model the critical information processing. Specifically, IdeNet divides the entire perception process into five stages: information collection, information augmentation, information filtering, information localization, and information correction and object identification. In addition, we design tailored visual information processing mechanisms for each stage, including the information augmentation module (IAM), the information filtering module (IFM), the information localization module (ILM), and the information correction module (ICM), to model the critical visual information processing and establish the inextricable association of biological behavior and visual information processing. The extensive experiments show that IdeNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the five-stage partitioning of visual information processing pathway and the tailored visual information processing mechanisms for camouflaged object detection.

Despite this wide interest and advancement in measurement techniques, the complexity of protein adsorption has frustrated its accurate prediction. To address this challenge, here, data regarding protein adsorption reported in the last four decades was collected, checked for completeness and correctness, organized, and archived in an upgraded, freely accessible Biomolecular Adsorption Database, which is equivalent to a large-scale, ad hoc, crowd-sourced multifactorial experiment. The shape and physicochemical properties of the proteins present in the database were quantified on their molecular surfaces using an in-house program (ProMS) operating as an add-on to the PyMol software. Machine learning-based analysis indicated that protein adsorption on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces is modulated by different sets of operational, structural, and molecular surface-based physicochemical parameters. Separately, the adsorption data regarding four ""benchmark"" proteins, i.e., lysozyme, albumin, IgG, and fibrinogen, was processed by piecewise linear regression with the protein monolayer acting as breakpoint, using the linearization of the Langmuir isotherm formalism, resulting in semiempirical relationships predicting protein adsorption. These relationships, derived separately for hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, described well the protein concentration on the surface as a function of the protein concentration in solution, adsorbing surface contact angle, ionic strength, pH, and temperature of the carrying fluid, and the difference between pH and the isoelectric point of the protein. When applying the semiempirical relationships derived for benchmark proteins to two other ""test"" proteins with known PDB structure, i.e., β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin, the errors of this extrapolation were found to be in a linear relationship with the dissimilarity between the benchmark and the test proteins.

40327458,MSNGO: multi-species protein function annotation based on 3D protein structure and network propagation.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>In recent years, protein function prediction has broken through the bottleneck of sequence features, significantly improving prediction accuracy using high-precision protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2. While single-species protein function prediction methods have achieved remarkable success, multi-species approaches still face challenges such as difficulties in multi-source data integration and insufficient knowledge transfer between distantly-related species. How to integrate large-scale data and provide effective cross-species label propagation for species with sparse protein annotations remains a critical and unresolved challenge. To address this problem, we propose the MSNGO (Multi-species protein Structures and Network to predict GO terms) model, which integrates structural features and network propagation methods. Our validation shows that using structural features can significantly improve the accuracy of multi-species protein function prediction.<h4>Results</h4>We employ graph representation learning techniques to extract amino acid representations from protein structure contact maps and train a structural model using a graph convolution pooling module to derive protein-level structural features. After incorporating the sequence features from ESM-2, we apply a network propagation algorithm to aggregate information and update node representations within a heterogeneous network.

Among different existing SNP genotyping techniques, melting curve analysis (MCA) becomes increasingly popular due to its high accuracy and straightforward procedures in extracting the melting temperature (<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>). Yet, its study on existing digital microfluidic (DMF) platforms has intrinsic limitations due to the temperature inhomogeneity within a thickened droplet during the on-chip rapid heating process.

Specifically, the hydrothermal and photocatalysis treatment allows the functional substrate to exhibit a superwettability contrast of >170°, facilitating passive isolation of the pL-scale DNA sample into highly-resolved pL droplets above the 200 μm superhydrophilic patterns. This high-resolution MCA technique can successfully discriminate <i>KRAS</i> gene targets with single-nucleotide mutations in 3 seconds.

They serve as a resource of biological knowledge for bioinformatics analyses, and also comprise the subsequent results. However, the interpretation of biological networks is challenging and requires suitable visualizations dependent on the contained information. The most prominent software in the field for the visualization of biological networks is Cytoscape, a desktop modeling environment also including many features for analysis. A further challenge when working with networks is their distribution. Within a typical collaborative workflow, even slight changes of the network data force one to repeat the visualization step as well.

This makes internal migration intensities an important component for understanding the dynamics of population change according to size, composition and across geographies. While incorporating migration into demography's quantitative framework allows a description of population change across both time and space, and mathematical and conceptual frameworks for migration have been developed, researchers lack a public repository of historical age-origin-destination-specific migration probabilities that is in a common format and spans a range of countries. Addressing this requires a robust method for inferring migration probabilities from census and survey data when there are significant levels of uncertainty from small-sample noise and age aggregation. In this paper we extend the P-TOPALS and P-spline methods for smoothing migration probabilities to apply to grouped data by ages to develop a methods protocol for a harmonised, homogeneous format and multi-nation Human Internal Migration Database. We find our method out-performs a hybrid spline-parametric method in terms of both accuracy and plausibility.

36330927,QTLbase2: an enhanced catalog of human quantitative trait loci on extensive molecular phenotypes.,"Deciphering the fine-scale molecular mechanisms that shape the genetic effects at disease-associated loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains challenging. The key avenue is to identify the essential molecular phenotypes that mediate the causal variant and disease under particular biological conditions. Therefore, integrating GWAS signals with context-specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (such as different tissue/cell types, disease states, and perturbations) from extensive molecular phenotypes would present important strategies for full understanding of disease genetics. Via persistent curation and systematic data processing of large-scale human molecular trait QTLs (xQTLs), we updated our previous QTLbase database (now QTLbase2, http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase) to comprehensively analyze and visualize context-specific QTLs across 22 molecular phenotypes and over 95 tissue/cell types. Overall, the resource features the following major updates and novel functions: (i) 960 more genome-wide QTL summary statistics from 146 independent studies; (ii) new data for 10 previously uncompiled QTL types; (iii) variant query scope expanded to fit 195 QTL datasets based on whole-genome sequencing; (iv) supports filtering and comparison of QTLs for different biological conditions, such as stimulation types and disease states; (v) a new linkage disequilibrium viewer to facilitate variant prioritization across tissue/cell types and QTL types.",False,True,,0.7139945,qtlbase2 | qtlbase,,16.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,QTLbase2,True,3.0,False,False,http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase,http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase,True,"...ated our previous QTLbase database (now QTLbase2, http://mulinlab.org/qtlbase) to comprehensively analyze and visualize context...",1
39607778,BWT construction and search at the terabase scale.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a common component in full-text indices. Initially developed for data compression, it is particularly powerful for encoding redundant sequences such as pangenome data. However, BWT construction is resource intensive and hard to be parallelized, and many methods for querying large full-text indices only report exact matches or their simple extensions. These limitations have hampered the biological applications of full-text indices.<h4>Results</h4>We developed ropebwt3 for efficient BWT construction and query. Ropebwt3 indexed 320 assembled human genomes in 65 h and indexed 7.3 terabases of commonly studied bacterial assemblies in 26 days. This was achieved using up to 170 gigabytes of memory at the peak without working disk space. Ropebwt3 can find maximal exact matches and inexact alignments under affine-gap penalties, and can retrieve similar local haplotypes matching a query sequence. It demonstrates the feasibility of full-text indexing at the terabase scale.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://github.com/lh3/ropebwt3.",False,True,,0.7165033,,bwt,16.0,ok,,ropebwt3,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,https://github.com/lh3/ropebwt3,,False,,1

40050634,CUGUV: A Benchmark Dataset for Promoting Large-Scale Urban Village Mapping with Deep Learning Models.,"Delineating the extent of urban villages (UVs) is crucial for effective urban planning and management, as well as for providing targeted policy and financial support. Unlike field surveys, the interpretation of satellite imagery provides an efficient, near real-time, and objective means of mapping UV. However, current research efforts predominantly concentrate on individual cities, resulting in a scarcity of interpretable UV maps for numerous other cities. This gap in availability not only hinders public awareness of the distribution and evolution of UV but also limits the reliability and transferability of models due to the insufficient number and diversity of samples. To address this issue, we developed CUGUV, a benchmark dataset that includes a diverse collection of thousands of UV samples, carefully curated from 15 major cities across various geographical regions in China.

35659771,InflamNat: web-based database and predictor of anti-inflammatory natural products.,"Natural products (NPs) are a valuable source for anti-inflammatory drug discovery. However, they are limited by the unpredictability of the structures and functions. Therefore, computational and data-driven pre-evaluation could enable more efficient NP-inspired drug development. Since NPs possess structural features that differ from synthetic compounds, models trained with synthetic compounds may not perform well with NPs. There is also an urgent demand for well-curated databases and user-friendly predictive tools. We presented a comprehensive online web platform (InflamNat, http://www.inflamnat.com/ or http://39.104.56.4/ ) for anti-inflammatory natural product research. InflamNat is a database containing the physicochemical properties, cellular anti-inflammatory bioactivities, and molecular targets of 1351 NPs that tested on their anti-inflammatory activities.

37822561,ASCARIS: Positional feature annotation and protein structure-based representation of single amino acid variations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genomic variations may cause deleterious effects on protein functionality and perturb biological processes. Elucidating the effects of variations is critical for developing novel treatment strategies for diseases of genetic origin. Computational approaches have been aiding the work in this field by modeling and analyzing the mutational landscape. However, new approaches are required, especially for accurate representation and data-centric analysis of sequence variations.<h4>Method</h4>In this study, we propose ASCARIS (Annotation and StruCture-bAsed RepresentatIon of Single amino acid variations), a method for the featurization (i.e., quantitative representation) of single amino acid variations (SAVs), which could be used for a variety of purposes, such as predicting their functional effects or building multi-omics-based integrative models. ASCARIS utilizes the direct and spatial correspondence between the location of the SAV on the sequence/structure and 30 different types of positional feature annotations (e.g., active/lipidation/glycosylation sites; calcium/metal/DNA binding, inter/transmembrane regions, etc.), along with structural features and physicochemical properties. The main novelty of this method lies in constructing reusable numerical representations of SAVs via functional annotations.<h4>Results</h4>We statistically analyzed the relationship between these features and the consequences of variations and found that each carries information in this regard. To investigate potential applications of ASCARIS, we trained variant effect prediction models that utilize our SAV representations as input. We carried out an ablation study and a comparison against the state-of-the-art methods and observed that ASCARIS has a competing and complementary performance against widely-used predictors. ASCARIS can be used alone or in combination with other approaches to represent SAVs from a functional perspective.

It is important to systematically identify protein mis-localization events in a given condition. Experimental methods for finding mis-localized proteins are always costly and time consuming. Predicting protein subcellular localizations has been studied for many years. However, only a handful of existing works considered protein subcellular location alterations. We proposed a computational method for identifying alterations of protein subcellular locations under drug treatments. We took three drugs, including TSA (trichostain A), bortezomib and tacrolimus, as instances for this study. By introducing dynamic protein-protein interaction networks, graph neural network algorithms were applied to aggregate topological information under different conditions. We systematically reported potential protein mis-localization events under drug treatments. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to find protein mis-localization events computationally in drug treatment conditions. Literatures validated that a number of proteins, which are highly related to pharmacological mechanisms of these drugs, may undergo protein localization alterations.

35266814,The CIAMIB: a Large and Metabolically Diverse Collection of Inflammation-Associated Bacteria from the Murine Gut.,"Gut inflammation directly impacts the growth and stability of commensal gut microbes and can lead to long-lasting changes in microbiota composition that can prolong or exacerbate disease states. While mouse models are used extensively to investigate the interplay between microbes and the inflamed state, the paucity of cultured mouse gut microbes has hindered efforts to determine causal relationships. To address this issue, we are assembling the Collection of Inflammation-Associated Mouse Intestinal Bacteria (CIAMIB). The initial release of this collection comprises 41 isolates of 39 unique bacterial species, covering 4 phyla and containing 10 previously uncultivated isolates, including 1 novel family and 7 novel genera. The collection significantly expands the number of available Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Coriobacteriaceae isolates and includes microbes from genera associated with inflammation, such as <i>Prevotella</i> and Klebsiella. We characterized the growth of CIAMIB isolates across a diverse range of nutritional conditions and predicted their metabolic potential and anaerobic fermentation capacity based on the genomes of these isolates. We also provide the first metabolic analysis of species within the genus <i>Adlercreutzia</i>, revealing these representatives to be nitrate-reducing and severely restricted in their ability to grow on carbohydrates. CIAMIB isolates are fully sequenced and available to the scientific community as a powerful tool to study host-microbiota interactions. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Attempts to explore the role of the microbiota in animal physiology have resulted in large-scale efforts to cultivate the thousands of microbes that are associated with humans. In contrast, relatively few lab mouse-associated bacteria have been isolated, despite the fact that the overwhelming number of studies on the microbiota use laboratory mice that are colonized with microbes that are quite distinct from those in humans. Here, we report the results of a large-scale isolation of bacteria from the intestines of laboratory mice either prone to or suffering from gut inflammation. This collection comprises dozens of novel isolates, many of which represent the only cultured representatives of their genus or species.

33382660,miRCoop: Identifying Cooperating miRNAs via Kernel Based Interaction Tests.,"Although miRNAs can cause widespread changes in expression programs, single miRNAs typically induce mild repression on their targets. Cooperativity among miRNAs is reported as one strategy to overcome this constraint. Expanding the catalog of synergistic miRNAs is critical for understanding gene regulation and for developing miRNA-based therapeutics. In this study, we develop miRCoop to identify synergistic miRNA pairs that have weak or no repression on the target mRNA individually, but when act together, induce strong repression. miRCoop uses kernel-based statistical interaction tests, together with miRNA and mRNA target information. We apply our approach to patient data of two different cancer types. In kidney cancer, we identify 66 putative triplets. For 64 of these triplets, there is at least one common transcription factor that potentially regulates all participating RNAs of the triplet, supporting a functional association among them. Furthermore, we find that identified triplets are enriched for certain biological processes that are relevant to kidney cancer. Some of the synergistic miRNAs are very closely encoded in the genome, hinting a functional association among them. In applying the method on tumor data with the primary liver site, we find 3105 potential triplet interactions. We believe miRCoop can aid our understanding of the complex regulatory interactions in different health and disease states of the cell and can help in designing miRNA-based therapies.

However, the weak correlation between emotions and semantics poses significant challenges to emotion recognition in dialogue. Semantically similar utterances can express different types of emotions, depending on the context or speaker. In order to tackle this challenge, our paper proposes a novel loss called Focal Weighted Loss (FWL) with adversarial training and the compact language model MobileBERT. Our proposed loss function handles the problem of imbalanced emotion classification through Focal Weighted Loss and adversarial training and does not require large batch sizes or more computational resources. Our approach has been employed on four text emotion recognition benchmark datasets, MELD, EmoryNLP, DailyDialog and IEMOCAP demonstrating competitive performance. Extensive experiments on these benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed FWL with adversarial training. This enables more human-like interactions on digital platforms.

However, the 3D movement of these drones with higher speeds results in a network of highly dynamic topology and intermittent connections, making the standard Ad Hoc routing protocols are not suitable for FANET. The approaches followed to address this issue include designing from scratch a routing protocol specific to FANET or modifying the existing protocols. From the view point of reliability, accuracy, and time, it is preferable to base the work on a protocol standard. But before amending the standard, tuning its performance and applying it under suitable conditions may be satisfactory for the new use.

The production process of protein crystals on which the XRD technique relies has undergone multiple experimental steps, which requires a lot of manpower and material resources. In addition, studies have shown that not all proteins can form crystals under experimental conditions, and the success rate of the final crystallization of proteins is only <10%. Although some protein crystallization predictors have been developed, not many tools capable of predicting multi-stage protein crystallization propensity are available and the accuracy of these tools is not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, named SADeepcry, for predicting protein crystallization propensity. The framework can be used to estimate the three steps (protein material production, purification and crystallization) in protein crystallization experiments and the success rate of the final protein crystallization. SADeepcry uses the optimized self-attention and auto-encoder modules to extract sequence, structure and physicochemical features from the proteins. Compared with other state-of-the-art protein crystallization propensity prediction models, SADeepcry can obtain more complex global spatial long-distance dependence of protein sequence information. Our computational results show that SADeepcry has increased Matthews correlation coefficient and area under the curve, by 100.3% and 13.4%, respectively, over the DCFCrystal method on the benchmark dataset.

Here, with a newly assembled reference genome for this tomato cultivar and abundant RNA-seq data derived from tissues of different organs/developmental stages/treatments, we constructed multiple gene co-expression networks, which will provide valuable clues for the identification of important genes involved in diverse regulatory pathways during plant growth, e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and fruit development. Additionally, non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were also identified, together with their potential targets. Interacting networks between different types of non-coding RNAs (miRNA-lncRNA), and non-coding RNAs and genes (miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-mRNA) were constructed as well. Our results and data will provide valuable information for the study of organ differentiation and development of this important fruit. Lastly, we established a database (http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase/) with genomic and transcriptomic data, as well as details of gene co-expression and interacting networks on MicroTom, and this database should be of great value to those who want to adopt MicroTom as a model plant for research.",False,True,,0.70319647,microtom,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase/,http://eplant.njau.edu.cn/microTomBase/,True,"...portant fruit.

Considering the constraints of velocity and maneuverability, a UAV energy efficiency (EE) model was proposed via collaborative design resource allocation and trajectory optimization. Based on this, an EE maximization problem was formulated to jointly optimize the transmit power of ground users and the trajectory of the UAV. To obtain the optimal solutions, this nonconvex problem was transformed into an equivalent convex optimization problem on the basis of three user clustering algorithms. After several alternating iterations, our proposed algorithms converged quickly.

37692080,MetaPep: A core peptide database for faster human gut metaproteomics database searches.,"Metaproteomics has increasingly been applied to study functional changes in the human gut microbiome. Peptide identification is an important step in metaproteomics research, with sequence database search (SDS) and spectral library search (SLS) as the two main methods to identify peptides. However, the large search space in metaproteomics studies causes significant challenges for both identification methods. Moreover, with the development of mass spectrometry, it is now feasible to perform metaproteomic projects involving 100-1000 individual microbiomes. These large-scale projects create a conundrum for searching large databases. In this study, we constructed MetaPep, a core peptide database (including both collections of peptide sequences and tandem MS spectra) greatly accelerating the peptide identifications. Raw files from fifteen metaproteomics projects were re-analyzed and the identified peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) were used to construct the MetaPep database. The constructed MetaPep database achieved rapid and accurate identification of peptides for human gut metaproteomics. MetaPep has a large collection of peptides and spectra that have been identified in published human gut metaproteomics datasets. MetaPep database can be used as an important resource in the current stage of human gut metaproteomics research.

However, theoretical calculations and code development remain labor-intensive challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach based on text-to-code generation, utilizing large language models to automate the implementation of simulation programs in materials science. The effectiveness of automated code generation and review is validated with thermodynamics simulations based on the LAMMPS software as a foundation. This study introduces Molecular Dynamics Agent (MDAgent), a framework designed to guide large models in automatically generating, executing, and refining simulation code. In addition, a thermodynamic simulation code dataset for LAMMPS was constructed to fine-tune the language model. Expert evaluation scores demonstrate that MDAgent significantly improves the code generation and review capabilities.

RFMIX version 2 (RFMIX2) utilizes a robust modeling approach to identify the genetic ancestries in admixed populations. However, this software does not have a built-in method to visually summarize the results of analyses. Here, we introduce the AncestryGrapher toolkit, which converts the numerical output of RFMIX2 into graphical representations of global and local ancestry (i.e. the per-individual ancestry components and the genetic ancestry along chromosomes, respectively).<h4>Results</h4>To demonstrate the utility of our methods, we applied the AncestryGrapher toolkit to visualize the global and local ancestry of individuals in the North African Mozabite Berber population from the Human Genome Diversity Panel. Our results showed that the Mozabite Berbers derived their ancestry from the Middle East, Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa (global ancestry). We also found that the population origin of ancestry varied considerably along chromosomes (local ancestry). For example, we observed variance in local ancestry in the genomic region on Chromosome 2 containing the regulatory sequence in the MCM6 gene associated with lactase persistence, a human trait tied to the cultural development of adult milk consumption. Overall, the AncestryGrapher toolkit facilitates the exploration, interpretation, and reporting of ancestry patterns in human populations.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The AncestryGrapher toolkit is free and open source on https://github.com/alisi1989/RFmix2-Pipeline-to-plot.",False,True,,0.71452653,ancestrygrapher,,16.0,ok,,north african mozabite berber | human genome diversity panel,rfmix2,spacy,0.0,AncestryGrapher toolkit,False,0.0,False,False,https://github.com/alisi1989/RFmix2-Pipeline-to-plot,,False,,1
37053159,SimpleMind: An open-source software environment that adds thinking to deep neural networks.,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) detect patterns in data and have shown versatility and strong performance in many computer vision applications. However, DNNs alone are susceptible to obvious mistakes that violate simple, common sense concepts and are limited in their ability to use explicit knowledge to guide their search and decision making. While overall DNN performance metrics may be good, these obvious errors, coupled with a lack of explainability, have prevented widespread adoption for crucial tasks such as medical image analysis. The purpose of this paper is to introduce SimpleMind, an open-source software environment for Cognitive AI focused on medical image understanding. It allows creation of a knowledge base that describes expected characteristics and relationships between image objects in an intuitive human-readable form. The knowledge base can then be applied to an input image to recognize and understand its content. SimpleMind brings thinking to DNNs by: (1) providing methods for reasoning with the knowledge base about image content, such as spatial inferencing and conditional reasoning to check DNN outputs; (2) applying process knowledge, in the form of general-purpose software agents, that are dynamically chained together to accomplish image preprocessing, DNN prediction, and result post-processing, and (3) performing automatic co-optimization of all knowledge base parameters to adapt agents to specific problems. SimpleMind enables reasoning on multiple detected objects to ensure consistency, providing cross-checking between DNN outputs. This machine reasoning improves the reliability and trustworthiness of DNNs through an interpretable model and explainable decisions.

38314912,ChIP-GPT: a managed large language model for robust data extraction from biomedical database records.,"Increasing volumes of biomedical data are amassing in databases. Large-scale analyses of these data have wide-ranging applications in biology and medicine. Such analyses require tools to characterize and process entries at scale. However, existing tools, mainly centered on extracting predefined fields, often fail to comprehensively process database entries or correct evident errors-a task humans can easily perform. These tools also lack the ability to reason like domain experts, hindering their robustness and analytical depth. Recent advances with large language models (LLMs) provide a fundamentally new way to query databases. But while a tool such as ChatGPT is adept at answering questions about manually input records, challenges arise when scaling up this process. First, interactions with the LLM need to be automated. Second, limitations on input length may require a record pruning or summarization pre-processing step. Third, to behave reliably as desired, the LLM needs either well-designed, short, 'few-shot' examples, or fine-tuning based on a larger set of well-curated examples. Here, we report ChIP-GPT, based on fine-tuning of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model Llama and on a program prompting the model iteratively and handling its generation of answer text. This model is designed to extract metadata from the Sequence Read Archive, emphasizing the identification of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) targets and cell lines. When trained with 100 examples, ChIP-GPT demonstrates 90-94% accuracy. Notably, it can seamlessly extract data from records with typos or absent field labels.

The ALMA toolbox enables the consistent and comprehensive analyses of locomotor kinematics and paw placement and can be applied to neurological conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord. We demonstrated that the ALMA toolbox can (1) robustly track the evolution of locomotor deficits after spinal cord injury, (2) sensitively detect locomotor abnormalities after traumatic brain injury, and (3) correctly predict disease onset in a multiple sclerosis model.

The Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) aims to identify all proteins encoded by the human genome and find functional annotations for them. However, until now there are still 1137 identified human proteins without functional annotation, called uPE1 proteins. Sequence alignment was insufficient to predict their functions, and the crystal structures of most proteins were unavailable. In this study, we demonstrated a new functional annotation strategy, AlphaFun, based on structural alignment using deep-learning-predicted protein structures. Using this strategy, we functionally annotated 99% of the human proteome, including the uPE1 proteins and missing proteins, which have not been identified yet. The accuracy of the functional annotations was validated using the known-function proteins. The uPE1 proteins shared similar functions to the known-function PE1 proteins and tend to express only in very limited tissues. They are evolutionally young genes and thus should conduct functions only in specific tissues and conditions, limiting their occurrence in commonly studied biological models. Such functional annotations provide hints for functional investigations on the uPE1 proteins.

The generation of diseases is closely related to gene and phenotype information. Generally, gene-phenotype relations are mainly obtained through clinical experiments, but the cost is huge. With the amount of published biomedical literature increasing exponentially, it carries a wealth of disease-related gene and phenotype information. This study provided an effective way to obtain disease-related gene and phenotype information. To our best knowledge, this work first attempted to explore relationships between genotype and phenotype about the pancreatitis from the computational perspective. It mined 6152 genes and 76,753 pairs of genotype and phenotype extracted from the biomedical literature about pancreatitis using text mining. Based on the above 76,753 pairs, the study proposed an improved normalized point-wise mutual information (REL-NPMI) model to optimize gene-phenotype relations related to pancreatitis, and obtained 12,562 gene-phenotype pairs which may be related to pancreatitis. The extracted top 20 results were validated and evaluated.

A general platform to produce robust affinity capture ligands for proteins beyond antibodies would improve bioprocessing efficiency. We previously developed nanoCLAMPs (nano Clostridial Antibody Mimetic Proteins), a class of antibody mimetic proteins useful as lab-scale affinity capture reagents. This work describes a protein engineering campaign to develop a more robust nanoCLAMP scaffold compatible with harsh bioprocessing conditions. The campaign generated an improved scaffold with dramatically improved resistance to heat, proteases, and NaOH. To isolate additional nanoCLAMPs based on this scaffold, we constructed a randomized library of 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> clones and isolated binders to several targets.

35759515,urPTMdb/TeaProt: Upstream and Downstream Proteomics Analysis.,"We have developed the underrepresented post-translational modification (PTM) database (urPTMdb), a PTM gene set database to accelerate the discovery of enriched protein modifications in experimental data. urPTMdb provides curated lists of proteins reported to be substrates of underrepresented modifications. Their enrichment in proteomics datasets can reveal unexpected PTM regulations. urPTMdb can be implemented in existing workflows, or used in TeaProt, an online Shiny tool that integrates upstream transcription factor enrichment analysis with downstream pathway analysis through an easy-to-use interactive interface. TeaProt annotates user-uploaded data with drug-gene interactions, subcellular localizations, phenotypic functions, gene-disease associations, and enzyme-gene interactions. TeaProt enables gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to discover enrichments in gene sets from various resources, including MSigDB, CHEA, and urPTMdb. We demonstrate the utility of urPTMdb and TeaProt through the analysis of a previously published Western diet-induced remodeling of the tongue proteome, which revealed altered cellular processes associated with energy metabolism, interferon alpha/gamma response, adipogenesis, HMGylation substrate enrichment, and transcription regulation through PPARG and CEBPA. Additionally, we analyzed the interactome of ADP-ribose glycohydrolase TARG1, a key enzyme that removes mono-ADP-ribosylation. This analysis identified an enrichment of ADP-ribosylation, ribosomal proteins, and proteins localized in the nucleoli and endoplasmic reticulum.

37365203,"Creation of a milk oligosaccharide database, MilkOligoDB, reveals common structural motifs and extensive diversity across mammals.","The carbohydrate fraction of most mammalian milks contains a variety of oligosaccharides that encompass a range of structures and monosaccharide compositions. Human milk oligosaccharides have received considerable attention due to their biological roles in neonatal gut microbiota, immunomodulation, and brain development. However, a major challenge in understanding the biology of milk oligosaccharides across other mammals is that reports span more than 5 decades of publications with varying data reporting methods. In the present study, publications on milk oligosaccharide profiles were identified and harmonized into a standardized format to create a comprehensive, machine-readable database of milk oligosaccharides across mammalian species. The resulting database, MilkOligoDB, includes 3193 entries for 783 unique oligosaccharide structures from the milk of 77 different species harvested from 113 publications. Cross-species and cross-publication comparisons of milk oligosaccharide profiles reveal common structural motifs within mammalian orders. Of the species studied, only chimpanzees, bonobos, and Asian elephants share the specific combination of fucosylation, sialylation, and core structures that are characteristic of human milk oligosaccharides. However, agriculturally important species do produce diverse oligosaccharides that may be valuable for human supplementation.

Microbiota-derived epitopes as molecular mimics of tumor antigens can bind human leukocyte antigen (HLA), thereby modulating host immunity. However, many questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the interactions between microbiota and the host's immune system in cancer. Here, MicroEpitope (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/MicroEpitope) was developed to provide and analyze the atlas of microbiota-derived epitopes in cancer. We manually collected available mass spectrometry (MS)-based HLA immunopeptidomes of 1190 samples across 24 cancer types. Alignment was performed against an in-house constructed theoretical library of human and intratumor microbiome encoded proteins, including 1298 bacterial and 124 viral species. Currently, MicroEpitope contains 51 497 bacteria and 767 virus-derived epitopes, mainly originating from Bacillus subtilis, Buchnera aphidicola and human cytomegalovirus. The common immunogenic features of epitopes were calculated, as well as their biochemical properties and the clinical relevance of corresponding bacteria and viruses across cancers. MicroEpitope also provides five analytical tools, and multiple visualization methods to facilitate understanding of the roles of microbiota-derived epitopes in cancer immunity.

The AgBioData Consortium (https://www.agbiodata.org/) currently represents 44 databases and resources (https://www.agbiodata.org/databases) covering model or crop plant and animal GGB data, ontologies, pathways, genetic variation and breeding platforms (referred to as 'databases' throughout). One of the goals of the Consortium is to facilitate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management and the integration of datasets which requires data sharing, along with structured vocabularies and/or ontologies. Two AgBioData working groups, focused on Data Sharing and Ontologies, respectively, conducted a Consortium-wide survey to assess the current status and future needs of the members in those areas. A total of 33 researchers responded to the survey, representing 37 databases. Results suggest that data-sharing practices by AgBioData databases are in a fairly healthy state, but it is not clear whether this is true for all metadata and data types across all databases; and that, ontology use has not substantially changed since a similar survey was conducted in 2017. Based on our evaluation of the survey results, we recommend (i) providing training for database personnel in a specific data-sharing techniques, as well as in ontology use; (ii) further study on what metadata is shared, and how well it is shared among databases; (iii) promoting an understanding of data sharing and ontologies in the stakeholder community; (iv) improving data sharing and ontologies for specific phenotypic data types and formats; and (v) lowering specific barriers to data sharing and ontology use, by identifying sustainability solutions, and the identification, promotion, or development of data standards.

38102790,The Iowa Health Data Resource (IHDR): an innovative framework for transforming the clinical health data ecosystem.,"<h4>Importance</h4>This manuscript will be of interest to most Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) as they retool for the increasing emphasis on translational science from translational research. This effort is an extension of the EDW4R work that most CTSAs have done to deploy infrastructure and tools for researchers to access clinical data.<h4>Objectives</h4>The Iowa Health Data Resource (IHDR) is a strategic investment made by the University of Iowa to improve access to real-world health data. The goals of IHDR are to improve the speed of translational health research, to boost interdisciplinary collaboration, and to improve literacy about health data. The first objective toward this larger goal was to address gaps in data access, data literacy, lack of computational environments for processing Personal Health Information (PHI) and the lack of processes and expertise for creating transformative datasets.<h4>Methods</h4>A three-pronged approach was taken to address the objective. The approach involves integration of an intercollegiate team of non-informatics faculty and staff, a data enclave for secure patient data analyses, and novel comprehensive datasets.<h4>Results</h4>To date, all five of the health science colleges (dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and public health) have had at least one staff and one faculty member complete the two-month experiential learning curriculum. Over the first two years of this project, nine cohorts totaling 36 data liaisons have been trained, including 18 faculty and 18 staff. IHDR data enclave eliminated the need to duplicate computational infrastructure inside the hospital firewall which reduced infrastructure, hardware and human resource costs while leveraging the existing expertise embedded in the university research computing team. The creation of a process to develop and implement transformative datasets has resulted in the creation of seven domain specific datasets to date.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The combination of people, process, and technology facilitates collaboration and interdisciplinary research in a secure environment using curated data sets.

36529979,SBH17: Benchmark Database of Barrier Heights for Dissociative Chemisorption on Transition Metal Surfaces.,"Accurate barriers for rate controlling elementary reactions on metal surfaces are key to understanding, controlling, and predicting the rate of heterogeneously catalyzed processes. While barrier heights for gas phase reactions have been extensively benchmarked, dissociative chemisorption barriers for the reactions of molecules on metal surfaces have received much less attention. The first database called SBH10 and containing 10 entries was recently constructed based on the specific reaction parameter approach to density functional theory (SRP-DFT) and experimental results. We have now constructed a new and improved database (SBH17) containing 17 entries based on SRP-DFT and experiments. For this new SBH17 benchmark study, we have tested three algorithms (high, medium, and light) for calculating barrier heights for dissociative chemisorption on metals, which we have named for the amount of computational effort involved in their use. We test the performance of 14 density functionals at the GGA, GGA+vdW-DF, and meta-GGA rungs. Our results show that, in contrast with the previous SBH10 study where the BEEF-vdW-DF2 functional seemed to be most accurate, the workhorse functional PBE and the MS2 density functional are the most accurate of the GGA and meta-GGA functionals tested. Of the GGA+vdW functionals tested, the SRP32-vdW-DF1 functional is the most accurate. Additionally, we found that the medium algorithm is accurate enough for assessing the performance of the density functionals tested, while it avoids geometry optimizations of minimum barrier geometries for each density functional tested. The medium algorithm does require metal lattice constants and interlayer distances that are optimized separately for each functional. While these are avoided in the light algorithm, this algorithm is found not to give a reliable description of functional performance. The combination of relative ease of use and demonstrated reliability of the medium algorithm will likely pave the way for incorporation of the SBH17 database in larger databases used for testing new density functionals and electronic structure methods.",False,True,,0.69672155,,sbh17,16.0,ok,,benchmark database of barrier heights for dissociative chemisorption on transition metal surfaces | gga+vdw-df,srp | beef,spacy,0.0,SBH17,True,5.0,True,True,,,False,,1

39102448,COPS: A novel platform for multi-omic disease subtype discovery via robust multi-objective evaluation of clustering algorithms.,"Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study.

40445983,Enhancing the dataset of CycleGAN-M and YOLOv8s-KEF for identifying apple leaf diseases.,"Accurate diagnosis of apple diseases is vital for tree health, yield improvement, and minimizing economic losses. This study introduces a deep learning-based model to tackle issues like limited datasets, small sample sizes, and low recognition accuracy in detecting apple leaf diseases. The approach begins with enhancing the CycleGAN-M network using a multi-scale attention mechanism to generate synthetic samples, improving model robustness and generalization by mitigating imbalances in disease-type representation. Next, an improved YOLOv8s-KEF model is introduced to overcome limitations in feature extraction, particularly for small lesions and complex textures in natural environments. The model's backbone replaces the standard C2f structure with C2f-KanConv, significantly enhancing disease recognition capabilities. Additionally, we optimize the detection head with Efficient Multi-Scale Convolution (EMS-Conv), improving the model's ability to detect small targets while maintaining robustness and generalization across diverse disease types and conditions. Incorporating Focal-EIoU further reduces missed and false detections, enhancing overall accuracy. The experiment results demonstrate that the YOLOv8s-KEF model achieves 95.0% in accuracy, 93.1% in recall, 95.8% in precision, and an F1-score of 94.5%. Compared to the original YOLOv8s model, the proposed model improves accuracy by 7.2%, precision by 6.5%, and F1-score by 5.0%, with only a modest 6MB increase in model size. Furthermore, compared to Faster RCNN, ResNet50, SSD, YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv6, YOLOv9s, and YOLOv10m, our model demonstrates substantial improvements, with up to 30.2% higher precision and 18.0% greater accuracy.

The main challenge lies in accurately mapping these mutations to protein structures and analysing their effects on protein function. To address this, Mut-Map (https://genemutation.org/) is a comprehensive computational pipeline designed to integrate mutation data from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer database with protein structural data from the Protein Data Bank and AlphaFold models. The pipeline begins by taking a UniProt ID and proceeds through mapping corresponding Protein Data Bank structures, renumbering residues, and assessing disorder percentages. It then overlays mutation data, categorizes mutations based on structural context, and visualizes them using advanced tools like MolStar. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of how mutations may disrupt protein function by affecting key regions such as DNA interfaces, ligand-binding sites, and dimer interactions. To validate the pipeline, a case study on the TP53 gene, a critical tumour suppressor often mutated in cancers, was conducted. The analysis highlighted the most frequent mutations occurring at the DNA-binding interface, providing insights into their potential role in cancer progression.

37234732,CocoaMFDB: A dataset of cocoa pod maturity and families in an uncontrolled environment in Côte d'Ivoire.,"Cocoa cultivation is the basis for chocolate production; it has a unique aroma that makes it useful in the production of snacks and usable for cooking or baking. The maximum harvest period of cocoa is normally once or twice a year and spread over several months, depending on the country. Determining the best harvesting period for cocoa pods plays a major role in the export process and the pods quality. The degree of ripening of the pods affects the quality of the resulting beans. Also, unripe pods do not have enough sugar and may prevent proper bean fermentation. As for too-mature pods, they are usually dry, and their beans may germinate inside the pods, or they may develop a fungal disease and cannot be used. Computer-based determination of the ripeness of cocoa pods throughout image analysis could facilitate massive cocoa ripeness detection. Recent technological advances in computing power, communication systems, and machine learning techniques provide opportunities for agricultural engineering and computer scientists to meet the demands of the manual. The need for diverse and representative sets of pod images is essential for developing and testing automatic cocoa pod maturity detection systems. In this perspective, we collected images of cocoa pods to set up a database of cocoa pods of the Côte d'Ivoire named CocoaMFDB. We performed a pre-processing step using the CLAHE algorithm to improve the quality of the images since the effect of the light was not controlled on our data set. CocoaMFDB allows the characterization of cocoa pods according to their maturity level and provides information on the pod family for each image. Our dataset comprises three large families, namely Amelonado, Angoleta, and Guiana, grouped into two maturity categories: the ripe and unripe pods.

Consequently, complementary non-invasive analytical techniques and non-contact measurement methods are often required. This study presents the most comprehensive spectral database to date, combining diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to aid in identifying pigments, dyes, and binders historically used in illuminated and decorated manuscripts. A total of 156 painting mock-ups were created using traditional techniques, incorporating variations in binders, pigment particle sizes, support types, surface roughness, and application methods. Spectral imaging was performed in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions, while DRIFTS analysis covered the middle wave infrared (MWIR) region. For DRIFTS, both contact and non-contact measurements were tested. Using the samples in the database, the influence of binder, support, and grain size on the sample spectra and color were analyzed and discussed. This database facilitates pigment and dye identification using DRIFTS or HSI data independently or in combination through data fusion, applying techniques ranging from direct spectral comparison to advanced methods such as machine learning and spectral unmixing.

Advances in sequencing technology and assembly algorithms have resulted in the ability to sequence large genomes and provided a wealth of data that are being used in comparative genomic analyses. Comparative analysis can be leveraged to systematically explore and evaluate the biological relationships and evolution between species, aid in understanding the structure and function of genes, and gain a better understanding of disease and potential drug targets. As our knowledge of genetics expands, comparative genomics can help identify emerging model organisms among a broader span of the tree of life, positively impacting human health.

However, achieving highly sensitive and reproducible SERS signals for label-free proteins remains challenging due to their weak Raman signals and structural complexity. In this study, silver nanomushroom arrays (Ag NMAs) as SERS substrates were readily prepared and surface-engineered using a facile template-assisted micro- and nanofabrication approach. The surface of the substrate exhibits nanoscale roughness, long-range order, and hydrophilicity, enabling rapid and uniform dispersion of protein molecules. These molecules are anchored through Ag-S bonds, resulting in ultrasensitive Raman signals driven by strong electromagnetic enhancement effects. The highly ordered array structure improves signal repeatability, achieving a relative standard deviation of as low as 4.32%. Additionally, utilizing the silicon characteristic peak of the SERS substrate as an internal standard significantly reduces measurement errors, allowing for reliable and precise quantitative detection of protein molecules, with a linear correlation coefficient (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) exceeding 0.96. Ultrasensitive SERS detection and effective protein discrimination via principal component analysis further validate the Ag NMA substrate's potential for universal trace protein detection.

Experimental methods for identifying silencers are always costly and time-consuming. Computational methods, which relies on genomic sequence features, have been introduced as alternative approaches. However, silencers do not have significant epigenomic signature. Therefore, we explore a new way to computationally identify silencers, by incorporating chromatin structural information. We propose the SilenceREIN method, which focuses on finding silencers on anchors of chromatin loops. By using graph neural networks, we extracted chromatin structural information from a regulatory element interaction network. SilenceREIN integrated the chromatin structural information with linear genomic signatures to find silencers. The predictive performance of SilenceREIN is comparable or better than other states-of-the-art methods. We performed a genome-wide scanning to systematically find silencers in human genome. Results suggest that silencers are widespread on anchors of chromatin loops. In addition, enrichment analysis of transcription factor binding motif support our prediction results.

We define the drivers of skin diversity to be considered when selecting sequencing datasets for the atlas and list practical hurdles during skin sampling that can result in data gaps and impede comprehensive representation and technical considerations for tissue processing and computational analysis, the accounting for which should minimize biases in cell type enrichments and exclusions and decrease batch effects.

40315414,The Aggregated Gut Viral Catalogue (AVrC): A unified resource for exploring the viral diversity of the human gut.,"The growing interest in the role of the gut virome in human health and disease, has led to several recent large-scale viral catalogue projects mining human gut metagenomes each using varied computational tools and quality control criteria. Importantly, there has been to date no consistent comparison of these catalogues' quality, diversity, and overlap. In this project, we therefore systematically surveyed nine previously published human gut viral catalogues. While these catalogues collectively screened >40,000 human fecal metagenomes, 82% of the recovered 345,613 viral sequences were unique to one catalogue, highlighting limited redundancy between the ressources and suggesting the need for an aggregated resource bringing these viral sequences together. We further expanded these viral catalogues by mining 7,867 infant gut metagenomes from 12 large-scale infant studies collected in 9 different countries. From these datasets, we constructed the Aggregated Gut Viral Catalogue (AVrC), a unified modular resource containing 1,018,941 dereplicated viral sequences (449,859 species-level vOTUs). Using computational inference tools, annotations were obtained for each vOTU representative sequence quality, viral taxonomy, predicted viral lifestyle, and putative host. This project aims to facilitate the reuse of previously published viral catalogues by the research community and follows a modular framework to enable future expansions as novel data becomes available.",False,True,,0.68075943,aggregated gut viral catalogue,avrc,16.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Aggregated Gut Viral Catalogue,True,6.0,True,True,,,False,,1
40315417,LSTM-conformal forecasting-based bitcoin forecasting method for enhancing reliability.,"Cryptocurrency is a new type of asset that has emerged with the advancement of financial technology, creating significant opportunities for research. bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency and holds significant research value. However, due to the significant fluctuations in bitcoin's value in recent years, predicting its value and ensuring the reliability of these predictions, which have become crucial, have gained increasing importance. A method that combines Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) with conformal prediction is proposed in this paper. Initially, the high-dimensional features in the dataset are divided using the Spearman correlation coefficient method, and features below 0.75 and above 0.95 are excluded. Subsequently, an LSTM model is built, and data are fed into it and the data is used to train the model to generate predictions. Finally, the predicted values generated by the LSTM are fed into the conformal prediction model, and confidence intervals for these values are generated to verify their reliability. In the conformal prediction model, the quantile loss of the loss function is defined, and an Average Coverage Interval (ACI) predictor is designed to improve the accuracy of the results. The experiments are conducted using data from CoinGecko, which is a publicly available data. The results show that the LSTM-conformal prediction (LSTM-CP) combination improves reliability.",False,True,,0.67427164,,lstm,16.0,ok,,coingecko,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36350503,MSINGB: A Novel Computational Method Based on NGBoost for Identifying Microsatellite Instability Status from Tumor Mutation Annotation Data.,"Microsatellite instability (MSI), a vital mutator phenotype caused by DNA mismatch repair deficiency, is frequently observed in several tumors. MSI is recognized as a critical molecular biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic selection in several cancers. Identifying MSI status for current gold standard methods based on experimental analysis is laborious, time-consuming, and costly. Although several computational methods based on machine learning have been proposed to identify MSI status, we need to further understand which machine learning model would favor identification for MSI and which feature subset is strongly related to MSI. On this basis, more effective machine learning-based methods can be developed to improve the performance of MSI status identification. In this work, we present MSINGB, an NGBoost-based method for identifying MSI status from tumor somatic mutation annotation data. MSINGB first evaluates the prediction performance of 11 popular machine learning algorithms and 9 deep learning models to identify MSI. Among 20 models, NGBoost, a novel natural gradient boosting method, achieves the overall best performance. MSINGB then introduces two feature selection strategies to find the compact feature subset, which is strongly related to MSI, and employs the SHAP approach to interpreting how selected features impact the model prediction. MSINGB achieves a better prediction performance on both the tenfold cross-validation test and independent test compared with state-of-the-art methods.",False,True,,0.6771378,,msingb | msi,16.0,conflict,,tumor mutation annotation data,shap,spacy,0.0,MSINGB,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

However, no platform is available to provide a comprehensive and systematic multi-omics analysis for millets, which seriously hinders the mining of stress-related genes and the molecular breeding of millets. Here, a free, web-accessible, user-friendly millets multi-omics database platform (Milletdb, http://milletdb.novogene.com) has been developed. The Milletdb contains six millets and their one related species genomes, graph-based pan-genomics of pearl millet, and stress-related multi-omics data, which enable Milletdb to be the most complete millets multi-omics database available. We stored GWAS (genome-wide association study) results of 20 yield-related trait data obtained under three environmental conditions [field (no stress), early drought and late drought] for 2 years in the database, allowing users to identify stress-related genes that support yield improvement. Milletdb can simplify the functional genomics analysis of millets by providing users with 20 different tools (e.g., 'Gene mapping', 'Co-expression', 'KEGG/GO Enrichment' analysis, etc.). On the Milletdb platform, a gene PMA1G03779.1 was identified through 'GWAS', which has the potential to modulate yield and respond to different environmental stresses. Using the tools provided by Milletdb, we found that the stress-related PLATZs TFs (transcription factors) family expands in 87.5% of millet accessions and contributes to vegetative growth and abiotic stress responses.

The Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can overcome the problem of low similarity sequences with distant relationships and are widely implemented within various sequence alignment softwares. However, the HMM-based sequence alignments can generate a large number of results, how to quickly screen and batch extract target homologs from microbiomes is the major sticking points. It is necessary to develop an integrated gene filter and extraction pipeline to quickly and accurately screen homologs. Here, we introduced the HMMER-Extractor for amino acids or nucleotide sequences extraction, which was a supporting toolkit through provided filtering scores and an iterative keyword matching (IKM) logic. To make it more user-friendly and accessible, we further presented a visualized web server platform. An interactive HTML output provided a user-friendly way to browse homologous annotations and sequence extraction. The web server provided the community with a streamlined and user-friendly interface to analyze microbiomes. Through the HMMER-Extractor, we constructed a cardiovascular disease related gene dataset of the macromolecular metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) based on 46,699 bacterial genomes from human gut. Approximately 21,014 and 1961 bacterial strains were identified to contain the cnt or cut operon of TMA, and the waa gene cluster of LPS, respectively.

36825752,FAPD: An Astringency Threshold and Astringency Type Prediction Database for Flavonoid Compounds Based on Machine Learning.,"Astringency is a puckering or velvety sensation mainly derived from flavonoid compounds in food. The traditional experimental approach for astringent compound discovery was labor-intensive and cost-consuming, while machine learning (ML) can greatly accelerate this procedure. Herein, we propose the Flavonoid Astringency Prediction Database (FAPD) based on ML. First, the Molecular Fingerprint Similarities (MFSs) and thresholds of flavonoid compounds were hierarchically clustering analyzed. For the astringency threshold prediction, four regressions models (i.e., Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT)) were established, and the best model was RF which was interpreted by the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach. For the astringency type prediction, six classification models (i.e., RF, GBDT, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)) were established, and the best model was SGD. Furthermore, over 1200 natural flavonoid compounds were discovered and built into the customized FAPD. In FAPD, the astringency thresholds were achieved by RF; the astringency types were distinguished by SGD, and the real and predicted astringency types were verified by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). Therefore, ML models can be used to predict the astringency threshold and astringency type of flavonoid compounds, which provides a new paradigm to research the molecular structure-flavor property relationship of food components.",False,True,,0.6881526,,fapd,16.0,ok,fapd | flavonoid astringency prediction database,flavonoid astringency prediction database | molecular fingerprint similarities,shap | sgd,spacy,0.0,FAPD,True,5.0,True,True,,,False,,1

However, replication fork progression can be challenged by many factors, including co-directional and head-on transcription-replication conflicts (TRC). Head-on TRCs are more dangerous for genome integrity. To study the direction of replication fork movement and TRCs, we developed a bioinformatics toolkit called OKseqHMM (https://github.com/CL-CHEN-Lab/OK-Seq, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7428883). Then, we used OKseqHMM to analyse a large number of datasets obtained by Okazaki fragment sequencing to directly measure the genome-wide replication fork directionality (RFD) and to accurately predict replication initiation and termination at a fine resolution in organisms including yeast, mouse and human. We also successfully applied our analysis to other genome-wide sequencing techniques that also contain RFD information (e.g. eSPAN, TrAEL-seq). Our toolkit can be used to predict replication initiation and fork progression direction genome-wide in a wide range of cell models and growth conditions. Comparing the replication and transcription directions allows identifying loci at risk of TRCs, particularly head-on TRCs, and investigating their role in genome instability by checking DNA damage data, which is of prime importance for human health.",False,True,,0.70807415,okseqhmm,,16.0,ok,,,rfd | espan | trael,spacy,0.0,OKseqHMM,False,0.0,True,False,https://github.com/CL-CHEN-Lab/OK-Seq | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7428883,,False,,1

39578580,HDBind: encoding of molecular structure with hyperdimensional binary representations.,"Traditional methods for identifying ""hit"" molecules from a large collection of potential drug-like candidates rely on biophysical theory to compute approximations to the Gibbs free energy of the binding interaction between the drug and its protein target. These approaches have a significant limitation in that they require exceptional computing capabilities for even relatively small collections of molecules. Increasingly large and complex state-of-the-art deep learning approaches have gained popularity with the promise to improve the productivity of drug design, notorious for its numerous failures. However, as deep learning models increase in their size and complexity, their acceleration at the hardware level becomes more challenging. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) has recently gained attention in the computer hardware community due to its algorithmic simplicity relative to deep learning approaches. The HDC learning paradigm, which represents data with high-dimension binary vectors, allows the use of low-precision binary vector arithmetic to create models of the data that can be learned without the need for the gradient-based optimization required in many conventional machine learning and deep learning methods. This algorithmic simplicity allows for acceleration in hardware that has been previously demonstrated in a range of application areas (computer vision, bioinformatics, mass spectrometery, remote sensing, edge devices, etc.). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider HDC for the task of fast and efficient screening of modern drug-like compound libraries. We also propose the first HDC graph-based encoding methods for molecular data, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvement over previous work. We compare our approaches to alternative approaches on the well-studied MoleculeNet dataset and the recently proposed LIT-PCBA dataset derived from high quality PubChem assays. We demonstrate our methods on multiple target hardware platforms, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), showing at least an order of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency versus even our smallest neural network baseline model with a single hidden layer.

By employing this method, researchers can pinpoint biological pathways that exhibit a higher level of enrichment for a given set of genes than would be anticipated by random chance. These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway. Here we propose a novel method to enrich the molecular pathways and prioritize them based on their importance and crucial role in the biological function using the graph and evidence-based approach and customized datasets called PathwayMind. It includes 2648 pathways, 4539 biological events, 2465847 protein-protein interactions and 124717 gene-to-pathway relationships and the role of 3510 unique initial genes in 11,992 molecular pathways.

The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) emerged as a cost-effective method in Finland and globally, offering surveillance data without requiring clinical diagnoses and complementing individual testing data. The widespread adoption of WBS for SARS-CoV-2 stimulated the development of interactive dashboards and online resources, facilitating data sharing and trend analysis by public health officials. However, most dashboards were developed to communicate only SARS-CoV-2 data. The WastPan project developed a microbial surveillance system to monitor multiple pathogens in Finland, covering 40% of the population. From February 2021 to February 2023, ten wastewater treatments plants, supported by three laboratories, monitored 32 selected pathogens including, among others, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the influenza A virus and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In this article we introduce the WastPan project's wastewater surveillance portal for monitoring multiple pathogens. We also discuss the challenges and different aspects of WBS portal development.

37874948,ProsperousPlus: a one-stop and comprehensive platform for accurate protease-specific substrate cleavage prediction and machine-learning model construction.,"Proteases contribute to a broad spectrum of cellular functions. Given a relatively limited amount of experimental data, developing accurate sequence-based predictors of substrate cleavage sites facilitates a better understanding of protease functions and substrate specificity. While many protease-specific predictors of substrate cleavage sites were developed, these efforts are outpaced by the growth of the protease substrate cleavage data. In particular, since data for 100+ protease types are available and this number continues to grow, it becomes impractical to publish predictors for new protease types, and instead it might be better to provide a computational platform that helps users to quickly and efficiently build predictors that address their specific needs. To this end, we conceptualized, developed, tested and released a versatile bioinformatics platform, ProsperousPlus, that empowers users, even those with no programming or little bioinformatics background, to build fast and accurate predictors of substrate cleavage sites. ProsperousPlus facilitates the use of the rapidly accumulating substrate cleavage data to train, empirically assess and deploy predictive models for user-selected substrate types. Benchmarking tests on test datasets show that our platform produces predictors that on average exceed the predictive performance of current state-of-the-art approaches.

To achieve these vital processes, this complex is supported by incredible tissue diversity, variously composed of epithelia, vessels, cartilage, bone, teeth, ligaments, and muscles, as well as mesenchymal, adipose, and peripheral nervous tissue. Recent single cell and spatial multiomics assays-specifically, genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-have annotated known and new cell types and cell states in human tissues and animal models, but these concepts remain limitedly explored in the human postnatal oral and craniofacial complex. Here, we highlight the collaborative and coordinated efforts of the newly established Oral and Craniofacial Bionetwork as part of the Human Cell Atlas, which aims to leverage single cell and spatial multiomics approaches to first understand the cellular and molecular makeup of human oral and craniofacial tissues in health and to then address common and rare diseases. These powerful assays have already revealed the cell types that support oral tissues, and they will unravel cell types and molecular networks utilized across development, maintenance, and aging as well as those affected in diseases of the craniofacial complex. This level of integration and cell annotation with partner laboratories across the globe will be critical for understanding how multiple variables, such as age, sex, race, and ancestry, influence these oral and craniofacial niches. Here, we 1) highlight these recent collaborative efforts to employ new single cell and spatial approaches to resolve our collective biology at a higher resolution in health and disease, 2) discuss the vision behind the Oral and Craniofacial Bionetwork, 3) outline the stakeholders who contribute to and will benefit from this network, and 4) outline directions for creating the first Human Oral and Craniofacial Cell Atlas.",False,True,,0.6719977,human oral and craniofacial cell atlas,,16.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

38481855,The InBIO Barcoding Initiative Database: DNA barcodes of Iberian Bees.,"<h4>Background</h4>Bees are important actors in terrestrial ecosystems and are recognised for their prominent role as pollinators. In the Iberian Peninsula, approximately 1,100 bee species are known, with nearly 100 of these species being endemic to the Peninsula. A reference collection of DNA barcodes, based on morphologically identified bee specimens, representing 514 Iberian species, was constructed. The ""InBIO Barcoding Initiative Database: DNA Barcodes of Iberian bees"" dataset contains records of 1,059 sequenced specimens. The species of this dataset correspond to about 47% of Iberian bee species diversity and 21% of endemic species diversity. For peninsular Portugal only, the corresponding coverage is 71% and 50%. Specimens were collected between 2014 and 2022 and are deposited in the research collection of Thomas Wood (Naturalis Biodiversity Center, The Netherlands), in the FLOWer Lab collection at the University of Coimbra (Portugal), in the Andreia Penado collection at the Natural History and Science Museum of the University of Porto (MHNC-UP) (Portugal) and in the InBIO Barcoding Initiative (IBI) reference collection (Vairão, Portugal).<h4>New information</h4>Of the 514 species sequenced, 75 species from five different families are new additions to the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) and 112 new BINs were added. Whilst the majority of species were assigned to a single BIN (94.9%), 27 nominal species were assigned to multiple BINs. Although the placement into multiple BINs may simply reflect genetic diversity and variation, it likely also represents currently unrecognised species-level diversity across diverse taxa, such as <i>Amegillaalbigena</i> Lepeletier, 1841, <i>Andrenarussula</i> Lepeletier, 1841, <i>Lasioglossumleucozonium</i> (Schrank, 1781), <i>Nomadafemoralis</i> Morawitz, 1869 and <i>Sphecodesalternatus</i> Smith, 1853. Further species pairs of <i>Colletes</i>, <i>Hylaeus</i> and <i>Nomada</i> were placed into the same BINs, emphasising the need for integrative taxonomy within Iberia and across the Mediterranean Basin more broadly. These data substantially contribute to our understanding of bee genetic diversity and DNA barcodes in Iberia and provide an important baseline for ongoing taxonomic revisions in the West Palaearctic biogeographical region.",False,True,,0.6386515,barcoding initiative database,inbio,16.0,conflict,,barcode of life data system,flower,spacy,0.0,InBIO Barcoding Initiative Database,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

37859287,Cx22: A new publicly available dataset for deep learning-based segmentation of cervical cytology images.,"The segmentation of cervical cytology images plays an important role in the automatic analysis of cervical cytology screening. Although deep learning-based segmentation methods are well-developed in other image segmentation areas, their application in the segmentation of cervical cytology images is still in the early stage. The most important reason for the slow progress is the lack of publicly available and high-quality datasets, and the study on the deep learning-based segmentation methods may be hampered by the present datasets which are either artificial or plagued by the issue of false-negative objects. In this paper, we develop a new dataset of cervical cytology images named Cx22, which consists of the completely annotated labels of the cellular instances based on the open-source images released by our institute previously. Firstly, we meticulously delineate the contours of 14,946 cellular instances in1320 images that are generated by our proposed ROI-based label cropping algorithm. Then, we propose the baseline methods for the deep learning-based semantic and instance segmentation tasks based on Cx22. Finally, through the experiments, we validate the task suitability of Cx22, and the results reveal the impact of false-negative objects on the performance of the baseline methods. Based on our work, Cx22 can provide a foundation for fellow researchers to develop high-performance deep learning-based methods for the segmentation of cervical cytology images.

37974076,PRANA: an R package for differential co-expression network analysis with the presence of additional covariates.,"<h4>Background</h4>Advances in sequencing technology and cost reduction have enabled an emergence of various statistical methods used in RNA-sequencing data, including the differential co-expression network analysis (or differential network analysis). A key benefit of this method is that it takes into consideration the interactions between or among genes and do not require an established knowledge in biological pathways. As of now, none of existing softwares can incorporate covariates that should be adjusted if they are confounding factors while performing the differential network analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We develop an R package PRANA which a user can easily include multiple covariates. The main R function in this package leverages a novel pseudo-value regression approach for a differential network analysis in RNA-sequencing data. This software is also enclosed with complementary R functions for extracting adjusted p-values and coefficient estimates of all or specific variable for each gene, as well as for identifying the names of genes that are differentially connected (DC, hereafter) between subjects under biologically different conditions from the output.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Herewith, we demonstrate the application of this package in a real data on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The pea aphid is also used as a model to study fascinating biological traits of aphids, such as their extensive polyphenisms, their bacteriocyte-confined nutritional symbiosis, or their adaptation to the highly unbalanced diet represented by phloem sap. To get insights into the molecular basis of all these processes, it is important to have an appropriate annotation of transcription factors (TFs), which would enable the reconstruction/inference of gene regulatory networks in aphids. Using the latest version of the A. pisum genome assembly and annotation, which represents the first chromosome-level pea aphid genome, we annotated the complete repertoire of A. pisum TFs and complemented this information by annotating genes encoding chromatin-associated and basal transcription machinery proteins. These annotations were done combining information from the model Drosophila melanogaster, for which we also provide a revisited list of these proteins, and de novo prediction. The comparison between the two model systems allowed the identification of major losses or expansions in each genome, while a deeper analysis was made of ZNF TFs (with certain families expanded in the pea aphid), and the Hox gene cluster (showing reorganization in gene position in the pea aphid compared to D. melanogaster).

However, the linking problem is hard because usually no direct references between a clinical study and an associated collection are available.<h4>Methods</h4>The BBMRI-ERIC Directory and the ECRIN Metadata Repository (MDR), already include much of the information required to link clinical studies and related sample collections. In this study, we present the work performed to find and implement those links across existing corresponding records in the two systems. The linking process between MDR studies and related collections in the BBMRI-ERIC Directory started with exploring linkage in both directions - searching the BBMRI-ERIC Directory for candidate hits to try to link with MDR records, and searching the ECRIN MDR for candidate hits to try to link with Directory collections. Thereafter, a systematic search through the BBMRI-ERIC Directory was performed.<h4>Results</h4>The investigation of linkages in both directions resulted in a limited but promising number of linkages. The results of the systematic search of the Directory identified linkage of 202 studies, spanning 284 collections.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The analysis with existing data sources indicated that links between the BBMRI-ERIC and ECRIN collections exist, but also that they would be difficult to continuously identify and maintain without a great deal of manual work which neither organisation could support.

Yet, the therapeutic potential of targeting lectins remains largely untapped due in part to limitations in tools for building glycan-based drugs. One group of desirable structures is proteins with noncanonical glycans. Cell-free protein synthesis systems have matured as a promising approach for making glycoproteins that may overcome current limitations and enable new glycoprotein medicines. Yet, this approach has not been applied to the construction of proteins with noncanonical glycans. To address this limitation, we develop a cell-free glycoprotein synthesis platform for building noncanonical glycans and, specifically, clickable azido-sialoglycoproteins (called GlycoCAP). The GlycoCAP platform uses an <i>Escherichia coli</i>-based cell-free protein synthesis system for the site-specific installation of noncanonical glycans onto proteins with a high degree of homogeneity and efficiency. As a model, we construct four noncanonical glycans onto a dust mite allergen (Der p 2): α2,3 C5-azido-sialyllactose, α2,3 C9-azido-sialyllactose, α2,6 C5-azido-sialyllactose, and α2,6 C9-azido-sialyllactose. Through a series of optimizations, we achieve more than 60% sialylation efficiency with a noncanonical azido-sialic acid. We then show that the azide click handle can be conjugated with a model fluorophore using both strain-promoted and copper-catalyzed click chemistry.

38793613,Rapid Detection and Quick Characterization of African Swine Fever Virus Using the VolTRAX Automated Library Preparation Platform.,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of a severe and highly contagious viral disease affecting domestic and wild swine. The current ASFV pandemic strain has a high mortality rate, severely impacting pig production and, for countries suffering outbreaks, preventing the export of their pig products for international trade. Early detection and diagnosis of ASFV is necessary to control new outbreaks before the disease spreads rapidly. One of the rate-limiting steps to identify ASFV by next-generation sequencing platforms is library preparation. Here, we investigated the capability of the Oxford Nanopore Technologies' VolTRAX platform for automated DNA library preparation with downstream sequencing on Nanopore sequencing platforms as a proof-of-concept study to rapidly identify the strain of ASFV. Within minutes, DNA libraries prepared using VolTRAX generated near-full genome sequences of ASFV. Thus, our data highlight the use of the VolTRAX as a platform for automated library preparation, coupled with sequencing on the MinION Mk1C for field sequencing or GridION within a laboratory setting. These results suggest a proof-of-concept study that VolTRAX is an effective tool for library preparation that can be used for the rapid and real-time detection of ASFV.",False,True,,0.6427855,voltrax,,16.0,ok,,gridion,minion,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36712859,miRdisNET: Discovering microRNA biomarkers that are associated with diseases utilizing biological knowledge-based machine learning.,"During recent years, biological experiments and increasing evidence have shown that microRNAs play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of human complex diseases. Therefore, to diagnose and treat human complex diseases, it is necessary to reveal the associations between a specific disease and related miRNAs. Although current computational models based on machine learning attempt to determine miRNA-disease associations, the accuracy of these models need to be improved, and candidate miRNA-disease relations need to be evaluated from a biological perspective. In this paper, we propose a computational model named miRdisNET to predict potential miRNA-disease associations. Specifically, miRdisNET requires two types of data, i.e., miRNA expression profiles and known disease-miRNA associations as input files. First, we generate subsets of specific diseases by applying the grouping component. These subsets contain miRNA expressions with class labels associated with each specific disease. Then, we assign an importance score to each group by using a machine learning method for classification. Finally, we apply a modeling component and obtain outputs. One of the most important outputs of miRdisNET is the performance of miRNA-disease prediction. Compared with the existing methods, miRdisNET obtained the highest AUC value of .9998. Another output of miRdisNET is a list of significant miRNAs for disease under study. The miRNAs identified by miRdisNET are validated <i>via</i> referring to the gold-standard databases which hold information on experimentally verified microRNA-disease associations. miRdisNET has been developed to predict candidate miRNAs for new diseases, where miRNA-disease relation is not yet known. In addition, miRdisNET presents candidate disease-disease associations based on shared miRNA knowledge.

Starting with a pool of DNA oligonucleotides encoding peptides of interest, this protocol outlines a fully in vitro and massively parallel procedure for synthesizing the encoded peptides and covalently linking each to a corresponding cDNA tag. The resulting libraries of peptide/DNA conjugates can be used for highly multiplexed assays that leverage high-throughput sequencing to profile the binding or enzymatic specificities of proteins of interest. Here, we describe the implementation of PepSeq for fast and cost-effective epitope-level analysis of antibody reactivity across hundreds of thousands of peptides from <1 µl of serum or plasma input. This protocol includes the design of the DNA oligonucleotide library, synthesis of DNA-barcoded peptide constructs, binding of constructs to sample, preparation for sequencing and data analysis. Implemented in this way, PepSeq can be used for a number of applications, including fine-scale mapping of antibody epitopes and determining a subject's pathogen exposure history. The protocol is divided into two main sections: (i) design and synthesis of DNA-barcoded peptide libraries and (ii) use of libraries for highly multiplexed serology. Once oligonucleotide templates are in hand, library synthesis takes 1-2 weeks and can provide enough material for hundreds to thousands of assays. Serological assays can be conducted in 96-well plates and generate sequencing data within a further ~4 d.

Herein, we present a facile strategy for highly controllable oxidative etching of ultrasmall AuNPs and tailorable modulation of luminescence. The proper choice of a moderate oxidant, ClO<sup>-</sup>, could not only selectively etch the Au(I)-thiolate motifs from the nanoparticle surface at the subnanometer scale but also retained a stable metallic core structure without aggregation, which impressively prompted the wide-range luminescent switching from the visible to second near-infrared (NIR-II) region. The resultant oxidized AuNPs displayed highly luminescent NIR-II emission with a quantum yield of 3.0%, excellent monodispersed stability, ideal biocompatibility, and tunable shielding effects against protein adsorption. With those outstanding features, oxidized AuNPs could be utilized as nanoprobes for long-lasting and in vivo bioimaging of associated metabolic behaviors with distinguishable organ-specific targeting capabilities and ligand-mediated kinetics in nanoparticle clearance.

36696912,Hand-Powered Point-of-Care: Centrifugal Microfluidic Platform for Urine Routine Examination (μCUREX).,"Urinalysis is one of the simplest and most common medical tests in modern cities. With the assistance of professional technicians and equipment, people in metropolitan areas can effortlessly acquire information about their physiological conditions from traditional clinical laboratories. However, the threshold, including precise benchtop equipment and well-trained personnel, still remains a considerable dilemma for residents in healthcare-poor areas. Hence, it is a crucial and urgent topic to develop a smart and affordable widget to address this challenge. To improve the healthcare rights of residents, we proposed a disposable centrifugal microfluidic urine routine examination platform (named μCUREX) actuated with a modified hand-powered fan. Two parts of urinalysis (sediment test and chemical strip test) were integrated into the μCUREX disc. The influence on sedimentation by variant hand-powered manipulation was simulated using COMSOL. As a result, more than 70% of the sediment can be collected. Moreover, the color change of chemical strip papers (indicators for glucose, pH, protein, and occult blood) was recorded with a 3D-printed studio and analyzed after reaction with chemical-spiked and pH-adjusted artificial and human urine specimens. The whole process can be completed within 10 min, with only 200 μL of urine needed.

36074326,Dog-human translational genomics: state of the art and genomic resources.,"Innovative models for medical research are strongly required nowadays. Convincing evidence supports dog as the most suitable spontaneous model for several human genetic diseases. Decades of studies on dog genome allowed the identification of hundreds of mutations causing genetic disorders, many of which are proposed as counterparts responsible for human diseases. Traditionally, the murine model is the most extensively used in human translational research. However, this species shows large physiological differences from humans, and it is kept under a controlled artificial environment. Conversely, canine genetic disorders often show pathophysiological and clinical features highly resembling the human counterpart. In addition, dogs share the same environment with humans; therefore, they are naturally exposed to many risk factors. Thus, different branches of translational medicine aim to study spontaneously occurring diseases in dogs to provide a more reliable model for human disorders. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the knowledge and resources available today for all the researchers involved in the field of dog-human translational medicine. Some of the main successful examples from dog-human translational genomics are reported, such as the canine association studies which helped to identify the causal mutation in the human counterpart. We also illustrated the ongoing projects aiming to create public canine big datasets.

However, this has created discrepancies between published annotations and epigenome tracks, which have not been updated to keep pace with the new assemblies. Here, we used the latest improved telomere-to-telomere assembly of the model pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum to lift over the gene models from Phatr3, a previously annotated reference genome. We used the lifted genes annotation and newly published transposable elements to map the epigenome landscape, namely DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histones. This provides the community with PhaeoEpiView, a browser that allows the visualization of epigenome data and transcripts on an updated and contiguous reference genome, to better understand the biological significance of the mapped data. We updated previously published histone marks with a more accurate peak calling using mono instead of poly(clonal) antibodies and deeper sequencing.

Several factors contribute significantly including delayed diagnosis, emergence of drug resistance, and biofilm formation. Although various diagnostic methods are available for TB, such as sputum smear microscopy, culture techniques, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). They have notable limitations, including false positives and negatives, timeliness, and high cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an early and accurate diagnostic approach to control the infection. MicroRNA (miRNA)-based diagnostics have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the potential for earlier detection and reduced false-positivity. However, this field is still in development and requires specialized tools to accelerate miRNA research, streamline the process, and facilitate the creation of innovative diagnostic methods. To address this need, the MicroRNA Disease Databank (MDDB) was developed as a centralized platform providing extensive miRNA-related information.

The current research integrated remote sensing datasets (e.g., ASTER and Landsat OLI), field observations and petrographic investigations to explore structural and hydrothermal alteration zones linked to the mineralization. Our results revealed that the key tectonic structures trend NE to E-W, control the distribution of mineralization in the Mougueur Inleir and meso-cenozoic cover. Hydrothermal alteration mapping identified abundant iron-bearing minerals and quartz, closely associated with fault zones sush as Tit N'Ali, Tijane, Talharit, and Tamelahl.

37680201,PSF toolkit: an R package for pathway curation and topology-aware analysis.,"Most high throughput genomic data analysis pipelines currently rely on over-representation or gene set enrichment analysis (ORA/GSEA) approaches for functional analysis. In contrast, topology-based pathway analysis methods, which offer a more biologically informed perspective by incorporating interaction and topology information, have remained underutilized and inaccessible due to various limiting factors. These methods heavily rely on the quality of pathway topologies and often utilize predefined topologies from databases without assessing their correctness. To address these issues and make topology-aware pathway analysis more accessible and flexible, we introduce the PSF (Pathway Signal Flow) toolkit R package. Our toolkit integrates pathway curation and topology-based analysis, providing interactive and command-line tools that facilitate pathway importation, correction, and modification from diverse sources. This enables users to perform topology-based pathway signal flow analysis in both interactive and command-line modes. To showcase the toolkit's usability, we curated 36 KEGG signaling pathways and conducted several use-case studies, comparing our method with ORA and the topology-based signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) method. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can effectively identify ORA enriched pathways while providing more detailed branch-level information. Moreover, in contrast to the SPIA method, it offers the advantage of being cut-off free and less susceptible to the variability caused by selection thresholds. By combining pathway curation and topology-based analysis, the PSF toolkit enhances the quality, flexibility, and accessibility of topology-aware pathway analysis. Researchers can now easily import pathways from various sources, correct and modify them as needed, and perform detailed topology-based pathway signal flow analysis. In summary, our PSF toolkit offers an integrated solution that addresses the limitations of current topology-based pathway analysis methods. By providing interactive and command-line tools for pathway curation and topology-based analysis, we empower researchers to conduct comprehensive pathway analyses across a wide range of applications.",False,True,,0.71264184,,psf,16.0,ok,,,kegg | ora | spia,spacy,0.0,PSF toolkit,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Such mechanisms enable us to learn embedding functions capable of generalizing to new object angle views, facilitating rapid adaptation and efficient reasoning in dynamic contexts as users navigate their environment. Through experiments conducted on three distinct video sequences, our interactive-based method showcases significant performance improvements over fixed training/testing algorithms, even when trained on considerably smaller annotated samples collected through user feedback.

38630617,RNAscape: geometric mapping and customizable visualization of RNA structure.,"Analyzing and visualizing the tertiary structure and complex interactions of RNA is essential for being able to mechanistically decipher their molecular functions in vivo. Secondary structure visualization software can portray many aspects of RNA; however, these layouts are often unable to preserve topological correspondence since they do not consider tertiary interactions between different regions of an RNA molecule. Likewise, quaternary interactions between two or more interacting RNA molecules are not considered in secondary structure visualization tools. The RNAscape webserver produces visualizations that can preserve topological correspondence while remaining both visually intuitive and structurally insightful. RNAscape achieves this by designing a mathematical structural mapping algorithm which prioritizes the helical segments, reflecting their tertiary organization. Non-helical segments are mapped in a way that minimizes structural clutter. RNAscape runs a plotting script that is designed to generate publication-quality images. RNAscape natively supports non-standard nucleotides, multiple base-pairing annotation styles and requires no programming experience. RNAscape can also be used to analyze RNA/DNA hybrid structures and DNA topologies, including G-quadruplexes.

To fully leverage these complex and often heterogeneous data sets (i.e. those that differ in format and structure), scientists must invest considerable time in data processing, and data management has emerged as a considerable barrier for downstream application. Here, we propose a pipeline to enhance data collection, processing, and management from plant science studies comprising of two newly developed open-source programs. The first, called AgTC, is a series of programming functions that generates comma-separated values file templates to collect data in a standard format using either a lab-based computer or a mobile device.

There, data are stored and can be accessed for data analysis-related processes, including dynamic data visualization through web-based tools. Both AgTC and AgETL are flexible for application across plant science experiments without programming knowledge on the part of the domain scientist, and their functions are executed on Jupyter Notebook, a browser-based interactive development environment. Additionally, all parameters are easily customized from central configuration files written in the human-readable YAML format.

36271389,A comprehensive update on CIDO: the community-based coronavirus infectious disease ontology.,"<h4>Background</h4>The current COVID-19 pandemic and the previous SARS/MERS outbreaks of 2003 and 2012 have resulted in a series of major global public health crises. We argue that in the interest of developing effective and safe vaccines and drugs and to better understand coronaviruses and associated disease mechenisms it is necessary to integrate the large and exponentially growing body of heterogeneous coronavirus data. Ontologies play an important role in standard-based knowledge and data representation, integration, sharing, and analysis. Accordingly, we initiated the development of the community-based Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) in early 2020.<h4>Results</h4>As an Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) library ontology, CIDO is open source and interoperable with other existing OBO ontologies. CIDO is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology and Viral Infectious Disease Ontology. CIDO has imported terms from over 30 OBO ontologies. For example, CIDO imports all SARS-CoV-2 protein terms from the Protein Ontology, COVID-19-related phenotype terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology, and over 100 COVID-19 terms for vaccines (both authorized and in clinical trial) from the Vaccine Ontology. CIDO systematically represents variants of SARS-CoV-2 viruses and over 300 amino acid substitutions therein, along with over 300 diagnostic kits and methods. CIDO also describes hundreds of host-coronavirus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and the drugs that target proteins in these PPIs. CIDO has been used to model COVID-19 related phenomena in areas such as epidemiology. The scope of CIDO was evaluated by visual analysis supported by a summarization network method. CIDO has been used in various applications such as term standardization, inference, natural language processing (NLP) and clinical data integration. We have applied the amino acid variant knowledge present in CIDO to analyze differences between SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. CIDO's integrative host-coronavirus PPIs and drug-target knowledge has also been used to support drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CIDO represents entities and relations in the domain of coronavirus diseases with a special focus on COVID-19.

However, to have more socially engaging conversations, we need to formulate strategies that consider emotion, relevant-facts, and user behaviour in multi-turn conversations. Establishing such engaging conversations using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based approaches often suffer from the problem of exposure bias. Since MLE loss evaluates the sentences at the word level, we focus on sentence-level judgment for our training purposes. In this paper, we present a method named EmoKbGAN for automatic response generation that makes use of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in multiple-discriminator settings involving joint minimization of the losses provided by each attribute specific discriminator model (knowledge and emotion discriminator).

36484479,Emati: a recommender system for biomedical literature based on supervised learning.,"The scientific literature continues to grow at an ever-increasing rate. Considering that thousands of new articles are published every week, it is obvious how challenging it is to keep up with newly published literature on a regular basis. Using a recommender system that improves the user experience in the online environment can be a solution to this problem. In the present study, we aimed to develop a web-based article recommender service, called Emati. Since the data are text-based by nature and we wanted our system to be independent of the number of users, a content-based approach has been adopted in this study. A supervised machine learning model has been proposed to generate article recommendations. Two different supervised learning approaches, namely the naïve Bayes model with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer and the state-of-the-art language model bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), have been implemented. In the first one, a list of documents is converted into TF-IDF-weighted features and fed into a classifier to distinguish relevant articles from irrelevant ones. Multinomial naïve Bayes algorithm is used as a classifier since, along with the class label, it also gives the probability that the input belongs to this class. The second approach is based on fine-tuning the pretrained state-of-the-art language model BERT for the text classification task. Emati provides a weekly updated list of article recommendations and presents it to the user, sorted by probability scores. New article recommendations are also sent to users' email addresses on a weekly basis.

38909399,NNBGWO-BRCA marker: Neural Network and binary grey wolf optimization based Breast cancer biomarker discovery framework using multi-omics dataset.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>Breast cancer is a multifaceted condition characterized by diverse features and a substantial mortality rate, underscoring the imperative for timely detection and intervention. The utilization of multi-omics data has gained significant traction in recent years to identify biomarkers and classify subtypes in breast cancer. This kind of research idea from part to whole will also be an inevitable trend in future life science research. Deep learning can integrate and analyze multi-omics data to predict cancer subtypes, which can further drive targeted therapies. However, there are few articles leveraging the nature of deep learning for feature selection. Therefore, this paper proposes a Neural Network and Binary grey Wolf Optimization based BReast CAncer bioMarker (NNBGWO-BRCAMarker) discovery framework using multi-omics data to obtain a series of biomarkers for precise classification of breast cancer subtypes.<h4>Methods</h4>NNBGWO-BRCAMarker consists of two phases: in the first phase, relevant genes are selected using the weights obtained from a trained feedforward neural network; in the second phase, the binary grey wolf optimization algorithm is leveraged to further screen the selected genes, resulting in a set of potential breast cancer biomarkers.<h4>Results</h4>The SVM classifier with RBF kernel achieved a classification accuracy of 0.9242 ± 0.03 when trained using the 80 biomarkers identified by NNBGWO-BRCAMarker, as evidenced by the experimental results. We conducted a comprehensive gene set analysis, prognostic analysis, and druggability analysis, unveiling 25 druggable genes, 16 enriched pathways strongly linked to specific subtypes of breast cancer, and 8 genes linked to prognostic outcomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed framework successfully identified 80 biomarkers from the multi-omics data, enabling accurate classification of breast cancer subtypes.

At this point, smart ports become a more important paradigm for handling increasing cargo volumes and increasing operational efficiency. In fact, as ports become more congested and cargo volumes increase, the need for accurate navigation through seaports is more pronounced to avoid collisions and the resulting consequences. To this end, digital twin (DT) technology in the fifth-generation (5G) networks and drone-assisted data collection can be combined to provide precise ship maneuvering. In this paper, we propose a DT model using drone-assisted data collection architecture, called TwinPort, to offer a comprehensive port management system for smart seaports.

However, finding new Acrs has been challenging due to their low sequence similarity. Recent advances in protein structure prediction have opened new pathways for Acr discovery by using 3D structure similarity. This study presents an updated AcrDB, with the following new features not available in other databases: (1) predicted Acrs from human gut virome databases, (2) Acr structures predicted by AlphaFold2, (3) a structural similarity search function to allow users to submit new sequences and structures to search against 3D structures of experimentally known Acrs. The updated AcrDB contains predicted 3D structures of 795 candidate Acrs with structural similarity (TM-score ≥0.7) to known Acrs supported by at least two of the three non-sequence similarity-based tools (TM-Vec, Foldseek, AcrPred). Among these candidate Acrs, 121 are supported by all three tools. AcrDB also includes 3D structures of 122 experimentally characterized Acr proteins. The 121 most confident candidate Acrs were combined with the 122 known Acrs and clustered into 163 sequence similarity-based Acr families. The 163 families were further subject to a structure similarity-based hierarchical clustering, revealing structural similarity between 44 candidate Acr (cAcr) families and 119 known Acr families. The bacterial hosts of these 163 Acr families are mainly from Bacillota, Pseudomonadota, and Bacteroidota, which are all dominant gut bacterial phyla. Many of these 163 Acr families are also co-localized in Acr operons.

However, many of the available information about human allele frequencies, and about clinical drug-gene interactions, is based on American and European populations. PharmaKoVariome database was constructed to support genetic testing for safe prescription and drug development. It consolidated and stored 2507 diseases, 11 459 drugs and 61 627 drug-target or druggable genes from public databases. PharmaKoVariome precomputed ethnic-specific abundant variants for approximately 120 M single-nucleotide variants of drug-target or druggable genes. A user can search by gene symbol, drug name, disease and reference SNP ID number (rsID) to statistically analyse the frequency of ethnical variations, such as odds ratio and P-values for related genes. In an example study, we observed five Korean-enriched variants in the CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 genes, one of which (rs1065852) is known to be incapable of metabolizing drug. It is also shown that 4-6% of North and East Asians have risk factors for drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 gene.

35042806,Threatened Species Initiative: Empowering conservation action using genomic resources.,"Globally, 15,521 animal species are listed as threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and of these less than 3% have genomic resources that can inform conservation management. To combat this, global genome initiatives are developing genomic resources, yet production of a reference genome alone does not conserve a species. The reference genome allows us to develop a suite of tools to understand both genome-wide and functional diversity within and between species. Conservation practitioners can use these tools to inform their decision-making. But, at present there is an implementation gap between the release of genome information and the use of genomic data in applied conservation by conservation practitioners. In May 2020, we launched the Threatened Species Initiative and brought a consortium of genome biologists, population biologists, bioinformaticians, population geneticists, and ecologists together with conservation agencies across Australia, including government, zoos, and nongovernment organizations. Our objective is to create a foundation of genomic data to advance our understanding of key Australian threatened species, and ultimately empower conservation practitioners to access and apply genomic data to their decision-making processes through a web-based portal. Currently, we are developing genomic resources for 61 threatened species from a range of taxa, across Australia, with more than 130 collaborators from government, academia, and conservation organizations.

37697022,Enhanced brain tumor classification using graph convolutional neural network architecture.,"The Brain Tumor presents a highly critical situation concerning the brain, characterized by the uncontrolled growth of an abnormal cell cluster. Early brain tumor detection is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning. In this paper, a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is proposed using the publicly available Brain Tumor dataset from Kaggle to predict whether a person has brain tumor or not and if yes then which type (Meningioma, Pituitary or Glioma). The objective of this research and the proposed models is to provide a solution to the non-consideration of non-Euclidean distances in image data and the inability of conventional models to learn on pixel similarity based upon the pixel proximity. To solve this problem, we have proposed a Graph based Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) model and it is found that the proposed model solves the problem of considering non-Euclidean distances in images. We aimed at improving brain tumor detection and classification using a novel technique which combines GNN and a 26 layered CNN that takes in a Graph input pre-convolved using Graph Convolution operation. The objective of Graph Convolution is to modify the node features (data linked to each node) by combining information from nearby nodes. A standard pre-computed Adjacency matrix is used, and the input graphs were updated as the averaged sum of local neighbor nodes, which carry the regional information about the tumor. These modified graphs are given as the input matrices to a standard 26 layered CNN with Batch Normalization and Dropout layers intact. Five different networks namely Net-0, Net-1, Net-2, Net-3 and Net-4 are proposed, and it is found that Net-2 outperformed the other networks namely Net-0, Net-1, Net-3 and Net-4. The highest accuracy achieved was 95.01% by Net-2.

The biobank consists of 5485 samples representing 132 tissues from 13 dogs, 12 dog embryos, and 24 wolves. In a subset of 100 tissues from nine dogs and 12 embryos, we characterized gene expression activity for each promoter, including alternative and novel, i.e., previously not annotated, promoter regions, using the 5' targeting RNA sequencing technology STRT2-seq. We identified over 100,000 promoter region candidates in the recent canine genome assembly, CanFam4, including over 45,000 highly reproducible sites with gene expression and respective tissue enrichment levels.

Some of the most important bacteria have been purposely engineered to produce commercial quantities of antibiotics and therapeutics, and non-classical secretion systems are at the forefront of these technologies. Unlike the classical Sec or Tat pathways, non-classically secreted proteins share few common characteristics and use much more diverse secretion pathways for protein transport. Systematically categorizing and investigating the non-classically secreted proteins will enable a deeper understanding of their associated secretion mechanisms and provide a landscape of the Gram-positive secretion pathway distribution. We therefore developed PncsHub (https://pncshub.erc.monash.edu/), the first universal platform for comprehensively annotating and analyzing Gram-positive bacterial non-classically secreted proteins. PncsHub catalogs 4,914 non-classically secreted proteins, which are delicately categorized into 8 subtypes (including the 'unknown' subtype) and annotated with data compiled from up to 26 resources and visualisation tools. It incorporates state-of-the-art predictors to identify new and homologous non-classically secreted proteins and includes three analytical modules to visualise the relationships between known and putative non-classically secreted proteins.

Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are well established for encoding the dependence structure over a collection of variables in both inference and simulation settings. However, while modern machine learning is applied to data of an increasingly complex nature, DAG-based simulation frameworks are still confined to settings with relatively simple variable types and functional forms. We here present DagSim, a Python-based framework for DAG-based data simulation without any constraints on variable types or functional relations. A succinct YAML format for defining the simulation model structure promotes transparency, while separate user-provided functions for generating each variable based on its parents ensure simulation code modularization.

The standard approach to address this question is to carry out a goodness-of-recovery study. Here, the correlation between individual-participant true and estimated parameter values determines when a sample size is large enough. However, depending on one's research question, this approach may be suboptimal, potentially leading to sample sizes that are either too small (underpowered) or too large (overcostly or unfeasible). In this paper, we formulate a generalized concept of statistical power and use this to propose a novel approach toward determining how much data is needed to obtain useful parameter estimates from a computational model. We describe a Python-based toolbox (COMPASS) that allows one to determine how many participants are needed to fit one specific computational model, namely the Rescorla-Wagner model of learning and decision-making.

37566638,Practical sampling of constraint-based models: Optimized thinning boosts CHRR performance.,"Thinning is a sub-sampling technique to reduce the memory footprint of Markov chain Monte Carlo. Despite being commonly used, thinning is rarely considered efficient. For sampling constraint-based models, a highly relevant use-case in systems biology, we here demonstrate that thinning boosts computational and, thereby, sampling efficiencies of the widely used Coordinate Hit-and-Run with Rounding (CHRR) algorithm. By benchmarking CHRR with thinning with simplices and genome-scale metabolic networks of up to thousands of dimensions, we find a substantial increase in computational efficiency compared to unthinned CHRR, in our examples by orders of magnitude, as measured by the effective sample size per time (ESS/t), with performance gains growing with polytope (effective network) dimension. Using a set of benchmark models we derive a ready-to-apply guideline for tuning thinning to efficient and effective use of compute resources without requiring additional coding effort. Our guideline is validated using three (out-of-sample) large-scale networks and we show that it allows sampling convex polytopes uniformly to convergence in a fraction of time, thereby unlocking the rigorous investigation of hitherto intractable models. The derivation of our guideline is explained in detail, allowing future researchers to update it as needed as new model classes and more training data becomes available. CHRR with deliberate utilization of thinning thereby paves the way to keep pace with progressing model sizes derived with the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) tool set.

40548541,IECata: interpretable bilinear attention network and evidential deep learning improve the catalytic efficiency prediction of enzymes.,"Enzyme catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is a key parameter for identifying high-activity enzymes. Recently, deep learning techniques have demonstrated the potential for fast and accurate kcat/Km prediction. However, three challenges remain: (i) the limited size of the available kcat/Km dataset hinders the development of deep learning models; (ii) the model predictions lack reliable confidence estimates; and (iii) models lack interpretable insights into enzyme-catalyzed reactions. To address these challenges, we proposed IECata, a kcat/Km prediction model that provides uncertainty estimation and interpretability. IECata collected a dataset of 11 815 kcat/Km entries from the BRENDA and SABIO-RK databases, along with an out-of-domain test dataset of 806 entries from the literature. By introducing evidential deep learning, IECata provides uncertainty estimates for kcat/Km predictions. Moreover, it uses a bilinear attention mechanism to focus on learning crucial local interactions to interpret the key residues and substrate atoms in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Testing results indicate that the prediction performance of IECata exceeds that of state-of-the-art benchmark models. More importantly, it provides a reliable confidence assessment for these predictions. Case studies further highlight that the incorporation of uncertainty in screening for highly active enzymes can effectively increase the hit ratio, thereby improving the efficiency of experimental validation and accelerating directed enzyme evolution.

39123237,Mapping vaccine names in clinical trials to vaccine ontology using cascaded fine-tuned domain-specific language models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Vaccines have revolutionized public health by providing protection against infectious diseases. They stimulate the immune system and generate memory cells to defend against targeted diseases. Clinical trials evaluate vaccine performance, including dosage, administration routes, and potential side effects.<h4>Clinicaltrials</h4>gov is a valuable repository of clinical trial information, but the vaccine data in them lacks standardization, leading to challenges in automatic concept mapping, vaccine-related knowledge development, evidence-based decision-making, and vaccine surveillance.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a cascaded framework that capitalized on multiple domain knowledge sources, including clinical trials, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and the Vaccine Ontology (VO), to enhance the performance of domain-specific language models for automated mapping of VO from clinical trials. The Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a community-based ontology that was developed to promote vaccine data standardization, integration, and computer-assisted reasoning. Our methodology involved extracting and annotating data from various sources. We then performed pre-training on the PubMedBERT model, leading to the development of CTPubMedBERT. Subsequently, we enhanced CTPubMedBERT by incorporating SAPBERT, which was pretrained using the UMLS, resulting in CTPubMedBERT + SAPBERT. Further refinement was accomplished through fine-tuning using the Vaccine Ontology corpus and vaccine data from clinical trials, yielding the CTPubMedBERT + SAPBERT + VO model. Finally, we utilized a collection of pre-trained models, along with the weighted rule-based ensemble approach, to normalize the vaccine corpus and improve the accuracy of the process. The ranking process in concept normalization involves prioritizing and ordering potential concepts to identify the most suitable match for a given context. We conducted a ranking of the Top 10 concepts, and our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed cascaded framework consistently outperformed existing effective baselines on vaccine mapping, achieving 71.8% on top 1 candidate's accuracy and 90.0% on top 10 candidate's accuracy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study provides a detailed insight into a cascaded framework of fine-tuned domain-specific language models improving mapping of VO from clinical trials. By effectively leveraging domain-specific information and applying weighted rule-based ensembles of different pre-trained BERT models, our framework can significantly enhance the mapping of VO from clinical trials.",False,True,,0.69630826,vaccine ontology,,16.0,ok,,ctpubmedbert,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

KSHV has been extensively studied with various high-throughput RNA-sequencing approaches to map the transcription start and end sites, the splice junctions, and the translation initiation sites. Despite these efforts, the comprehensive annotation of the viral transcriptome remains incomplete. In the present study, we generated a long-read sequencing data set of the lytic and latent KSHV transcriptome using native RNA and direct cDNA-sequencing methods. This was supplemented with Cap Analysis of Gene Expression sequencing based on a short-read platform. We also utilized data sets from previous publications for our analysis. As a result of this combined approach, we have identified a number of novel viral transcripts and RNA isoforms and have either corroborated or improved the annotation of previously identified viral RNA molecules, thereby notably enhancing our comprehension of the transcriptomic architecture of the KSHV genome. We also evaluated the coding capability of transcripts previously thought to be non-coding by integrating our data on the viral transcripts with translatomic information from other publications.IMPORTANCEDeciphering the viral transcriptome of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is of great importance because we can gain insight into the molecular mechanism of viral replication and pathogenesis, which can help develop potential targets for antiviral interventions. Specifically, the identification of substantial transcriptional overlaps by this work suggests the existence of a genome-wide interference between transcriptional machineries.

To trace the past distributions of hoverfly species, verified records of historical collections are essential.<h4>New information</h4>Here, we provide data on 1071 specimens of hoverflies collected or received by Jean Timon-David and hosted at the Marseille Natural History Museum, France. Most of the specimens were collected by Timon-David himself and come from south-eastern France, mainly from the Departments of Bouches-du-Rhône, Var and Hautes-Alpes. Most of these specimens were checked for the accuracy of their identification according to the latest identification keys. This resulted in 85 additions to the known fauna of the French Departments, mostly for Var and Bouches-du-Rhône. The taxonomy of all specimens was checked against the latest available checklists and updated names added whenever necessary. Specimens received from entomologists working in other continents may also be valuable, as these are historic testimonies of the fauna of their own respective regions of origin and may, therefore, also be used as reference material. One paratype specimen from Australia is present in the collection. The holotype of <i>Cheilosia vangaveri</i> Timon-David, 1937 is absent from the collection and should be considered as lost.

35879669,SparkGC: Spark based genome compression for large collections of genomes.,"Since the completion of the Human Genome Project at the turn of the century, there has been an unprecedented proliferation of sequencing data. One of the consequences is that it becomes extremely difficult to store, backup, and migrate enormous amount of genomic datasets, not to mention they continue to expand as the cost of sequencing decreases. Herein, a much more efficient and scalable program to perform genome compression is required urgently. In this manuscript, we propose a new Apache Spark based Genome Compression method called SparkGC that can run efficiently and cost-effectively on a scalable computational cluster to compress large collections of genomes. SparkGC uses Spark's in-memory computation capabilities to reduce compression time by keeping data active in memory between the first-order and second-order compression. The evaluation shows that the compression ratio of SparkGC is better than the best state-of-the-art methods, at least better by 30%. The compression speed is also at least 3.8 times that of the best state-of-the-art methods on only one worker node and scales quite well with the number of nodes. SparkGC is of significant benefit to genomic data storage and transmission.

36289281,Mapping human disease-associated enzymes into Reactome allows characterization of disease groups and their interactions.,"According to databases such as OMIM, Humsavar, Clinvar and Monarch, 1494 human enzymes are presently associated to 2539 genetic diseases, 75% of which are rare (with an Orphanet code). The Mondo ontology initiative allows a standardization of the disease name into specific codes, making it possible a computational association between genes, variants, diseases, and their effects on biological processes. Here, we tackle the problem of which biological processes enzymes can affect when the protein variant is disease-associated. We adopt Reactome to describe human biological processes, and by mapping disease-associated enzymes in the Reactome pathways, we establish a Reactome-disease association. This allows a novel categorization of human monogenic and polygenic diseases based on Reactome pathways and reactions. Our analysis aims at dissecting the complexity of the human genetic disease universe, highlighting all the possible links within diseases and Reactome pathways. The novel mapping helps understanding the biochemical/molecular biology of the disease and allows a direct glimpse on the present knowledge of other molecules involved.

39762738,SequenceCraft: machine learning-based resource for exploratory analysis of RNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes represent artificial short DNA sequences bearing many catalytic properties. In particular, DNAzymes able to cleave RNA sequences have a huge potential in gene therapy and sequence-specific analytic detection of disease markers. This activity is provided by catalytic cores able to perform site-specific hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of an RNA substrate. However, the vast majority of existing DNAzyme catalytic cores have low efficacy in in vivo experiments, whereas SELEX based on in vitro screening offers long and expensive selection cycle with the average success rate of ~ 30%, moreover not allowing the direct selection of chemically modified DNAzymes, which were previously shown to demonstrate higher activity in vivo. Therefore, there is a huge need in in silico approach for exploratory analysis of RNA-cleaving DNAzyme cores to drastically ease the discovery of novel catalytic cores with superior activities.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we develop a machine learning based open-source platform SequenceCraft allowing experimental scientists to perform DNAzyme exploratory analysis via quantitative observed rate constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) estimation as well as statistical and clustering data analysis. This became possible with the development of a unique curated database of > 350 RNA-cleaving catalytic cores, property-based sequence representations allowing to work with both conventional and chemically modified nucleotides, and optimized k<sub>obs</sub> predicting algorithm achieving Q<sup>2</sup> > 0.9 on experimental data published to date.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work represents a significant advancement in DNAzyme research, providing a tool for more efficient discovery of RNA-cleaving DNAzymes.

40270708,CORN 2.0 - Condition Orientated Regulatory Networks 2.0.,"Gene regulation is a fundamental process that allows organisms to adapt to their environment and increase complexity through the action of nucleic acid-binding proteins (NBPs), such as transcription factors (TFs), which regulate specific sets of genes under distinct conditions. These regulatory interactions form transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), which can be further broken down into transcriptional regulatory sub-networks (TRSNs) centered around individual TFs. TRSNs are more stable and practical for analysis, making them ideal for studying gene regulation under specific conditions.

Researchers usually have to make significant efforts to generate well-structured and trustworthy datasets. This situation is aggravated when patients are involved, due to experimental, privacy, and safety constraints. The availability of public datasets can facilitate this process. In this work, we systematically review the scientific and technical literature to identify the human locomotion databases publicly available nowadays. Within the 93 datasets identified, we observed that the most basic motor skills, e.g., flat or sloped walking, are well covered, whereas many other daily-life motor skills are poorly represented. The most common sensors used to record gait are optical motion capture systems, followed by RGB cameras and inertial sensors. We observed a lack of consistency in the data formats and limited sample size in most reviewed datasets. These issues hinder researchers from systematically standing on previous research results and represent a major barrier to using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data algorithms.

Genome mining of CAZymes has become a routine data analysis in (meta-)genome projects, owing to the importance of CAZymes in bioenergy, microbiome, nutrition, agriculture, and global carbon recycling. In 2012, dbCAN was provided as an online web server for automated CAZyme annotation. dbCAN2 (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2) was further developed in 2018 as a meta server to combine multiple tools for improved CAZyme annotation. dbCAN2 also included CGC-Finder, a tool for identifying CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) in (meta-)genomes. We have updated the meta server to dbCAN3 with the following new functions and components: (i) dbCAN-sub as a profile Hidden Markov Model database (HMMdb) for substrate prediction at the CAZyme subfamily level; (ii) searching against experimentally characterized polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) with known glycan substates of the dbCAN-PUL database for substrate prediction at the CGC level; (iii) a majority voting method to consider all CAZymes with substrate predicted from dbCAN-sub for substrate prediction at the CGC level; (iv) improved data browsing and visualization of substrate prediction results on the website.

38190692,Assessing Face Image Quality: A Large-Scale Database and a Transformer Method.,"The amount of face images has been witnessing an explosive increase in the last decade, where various distortions inevitably exist on transmitted or stored face images. The distortions lead to visible and undesirable degradation on face images, affecting their quality of experience (QoE). To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Transformer-based method for quality assessment on face images (named as TransFQA). Specifically, we first establish a large-scale face image quality assessment (FIQA) database, which includes 42,125 face images with diversifying content at different distortion types. Through an extensive crowdsource study, we obtain 712,808 subjective scores, which to the best of our knowledge contribute to the largest database for assessing the quality of face images. Furthermore, by investigating the established database, we comprehensively analyze the impacts of distortion types and facial components (FCs) on the overall image quality. Accordingly, we propose the TransFQA method, in which the FC-guided Transformer network (FT-Net) is developed to integrate the global context, face region and FC detailed features via a new progressive attention mechanism. Then, a distortion-specific prediction network (DP-Net) is designed to weight different distortions and accurately predict final quality scores. Finally, the experiments comprehensively verify that our TransFQA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for quality assessment on face images.",False,True,,0.6760408,transformer | a large-scale,,16.0,conflict,,assessing face image quality | transfqa,dp-net | fiqa,spacy,0.0,Assessing Face Image Quality,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Accurate image segmentation is required for analyzing EM images. While manual segmentation is reliable, it is labor-intensive, incentivizing the development of automated segmentation methods. Although deep learning-based segmentation has demonstrated expert-level performance, it lacks generalizable performance across diverse EM datasets. Current approaches usually use either convolutional or transformer-based neural networks for image feature extraction. We developed the RETINA method, which combines pre-training on the large, unlabeled CEM500K EM image dataset with a hybrid neural-network model architecture that integrates both local (convolutional layer) and global (transformer layer) image processing to learn from manual image annotations.

38567644,Metagenomic-based discovery and comparison of the lignin degrading potential of microbiomes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems via the LCdb database.,"Lignin, as an abundant organic carbon, plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle. However, our understanding of the global lignin-degrading microbiome remains elusive. The greatest barrier has been absence of a comprehensive and accurate functional gene database. Here, we first developed a curated functional gene database (LCdb) for metagenomic profiling of lignin degrading microbial consortia. Via the LCdb, we draw a clear picture describing the global biogeography of communities with lignin-degrading potential. They exhibit clear niche differentiation at the levels of taxonomy and functional traits. The terrestrial microbiomes showed the highest diversity, yet the lowest correlations. In particular, there were few correlations between genes involved in aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways, showing a clear functional redundancy property. In contrast, enhanced correlations, especially closer inter-connections between anaerobic and aerobic groups, were observed in aquatic consortia in response to the lower diversity. Specifically, dypB and dypA, are widespread on Earth, indicating their essential roles in lignin depolymerization. Estuarine and marine consortia featured the laccase and mnsod genes, respectively. Notably, the roles of archaea in lignin degradation were revealed in marine ecosystems. Environmental factors strongly influenced functional traits, but weakly shaped taxonomic groups. Null mode analysis further verified that composition of functional traits was deterministic, while taxonomic composition was highly stochastic, demonstrating that the environment selects functional genes rather than taxonomic groups.

35536809,LitMC-BERT: Transformer-Based Multi-Label Classification of Biomedical Literature With An Application on COVID-19 Literature Curation.,"The rapid growth of biomedical literature poses a significant challenge for curation and interpretation. This has become more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. LitCovid, a literature database of COVID-19 related papers in PubMed, has accumulated over 200,000 articles with millions of accesses. Approximately 10,000 new articles are added to LitCovid every month. A main curation task in LitCovid is topic annotation where an article is assigned with up to eight topics, e.g., Treatment and Diagnosis. The annotated topics have been widely used both in LitCovid (e.g., accounting for ∼18% of total uses) and downstream studies such as network generation. However, it has been a primary curation bottleneck due to the nature of the task and the rapid literature growth. This study proposes LITMC-BERT, a transformer-based multi-label classification method in biomedical literature. It uses a shared transformer backbone for all the labels while also captures label-specific features and the correlations between label pairs. We compare LITMC-BERT with three baseline models on two datasets.

40189939,"Unequally Abundant Chromosomes and Unusual Collections of Transferred Sequences Characterize Mitochondrial Genomes of Gastrodia (Orchidaceae), One of the Largest Mycoheterotrophic Plant Genera.","The mystery of genomic alternations in heterotrophic plants is among the most intriguing in evolutionary biology. Compared to plastid genomes (plastomes) with parallel size reduction and gene loss, mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) variation in heterotrophic plants remains underexplored in many aspects. To further unravel the evolutionary outcomes of heterotrophy, we present a comparative mitogenomic study with 13 de novo assemblies of Gastrodia (Orchidaceae), one of the largest fully mycoheterotrophic plant genera, and its relatives. Analyzed Gastrodia mitogenomes range from 0.56 to 2.1 Mb, each consisting of numerous, unequally abundant chromosomes or contigs. Size variation might have evolved through chromosome rearrangements followed by stochastic loss of ""dispensable"" chromosomes, with deletion-biased mutations. The discovery of a hyper-abundant (∼15 times intragenomic average) chromosome in two assemblies represents the hitherto most extreme copy number variation in any mitogenomes, with similar architectures discovered in two metazoan lineages. Transferred sequence contents highlight asymmetric evolutionary consequences of heterotrophy: despite drastically reduced intracellular plastome transfers convergent across heterotrophic plants, their rarity of horizontally acquired sequences sharply contrasts parasitic plants, where massive transfers from their hosts prevail. Rates of sequence evolution are markedly elevated but not explained by copy number variation, extending prior findings of accelerated molecular evolution from parasitic to heterotrophic plants. Putative evolutionary scenarios for these mitogenomic convergence and divergence fit well with the common (e.g. plastome contraction) and specific (e.g. host identity) aspects of the two heterotrophic types. These idiosyncratic mycoheterotrophs expand known architectural variability of plant mitogenomes and provide mechanistic insights into their content and size variation.",False,True,,0.6578516,gastrodia,,16.0,ok,,unequally abundant chromosomes and unusual collections of transferred sequences characterize mitochondrial genomes of gastrodia,,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1

35650384,Deep-SAGA: a deep-learning-based system for automatic gaze annotation from eye-tracking data.,"With continued advancements in portable eye-tracker technology liberating experimenters from the restraints of artificial laboratory designs, research can now collect gaze data from real-world, natural navigation. However, the field lacks a robust method for achieving this, as past approaches relied upon the time-consuming manual annotation of eye-tracking data, while previous attempts at automation lack the necessary versatility for in-the-wild navigation trials consisting of complex and dynamic scenes. Here, we propose a system capable of informing researchers of where and what a user's gaze is focused upon at any one time. The system achieves this by first running footage recorded on a head-mounted camera through a deep-learning-based object detection algorithm called Masked Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN). The algorithm's output is combined with frame-by-frame gaze coordinates measured by an eye-tracking device synchronized with the head-mounted camera to detect and annotate, without any manual intervention, what a user looked at for each frame of the provided footage. The effectiveness of the presented methodology was legitimized by a comparison between the system output and that of manual coders. High levels of agreement between the two validated the system as a preferable data collection technique as it was capable of processing data at a significantly faster rate than its human counterpart. Support for the system's practicality was then further demonstrated via a case study exploring the mediatory effects of gaze behaviors on an environment-driven attentional bias.",False,True,,0.6600175,deep-saga,,11.97356296,ok,,convolutional neural network,saga,v2,0.97356296,Deep-SAGA,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

In order to bring greater impact to drug discovery, we propose the development of a DB of bioactive antiviral compounds. Several research groups have presented evidence of the antiviral activity of medicinal plants and compounds isolated from these plants. We believe that compiling these discoveries in a DB would benefit the scientific research community and increase the speed to discover new potential drugs and medicines. Thus, we present the Antiviral Medicinal Plant and Natural Product DB (avMpNp DB) as an important source for acquiring, organizing, and distributing knowledge related to natural products and antiviral drug discovery. The avMpNp DB contains a series of chemically diverse compounds with drug-like profiles. To test the potential of this DB, SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> and PL<sup>pro</sup> enzymatic inhibition assays were performed for available compounds resulting in IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 6.308±0.296 to 15.795±0.155 μM.

This study focuses on estimating baseflow using deep learning algorithms that enhance the estimation capabilities in both gauged and ungauged basins. Recognizing the shortage in accessible high quality daily baseflow data, our objective is to generate a daily baseflow dataset across the contiguous United States (CONUS) for 1661 basins from 1981 to 2022. This dataset provides valuable information for earth and environmental scientists, and water resource managers, enhancing our understanding of the water cycle.

35749394,TRR: Target-relation regulated network for sequential recommendation.,"Item co-occurrence is an important pattern in recommendation. Due to the difference in correlation, the matching degrees between the target and historical items vary. The higher the matching degree, the greater probability they co-occur. Recently, the recommendation performance has been greatly improved by leveraging item relations. As an important bond imposed by relations, these connected items should have a strong correlation in the calculation of certain measures. This kind of correlation can be the biased knowledge that benefits parameter training. Specifically, we focus on tuples containing the target item and latest relational items that have relations such as complement or substitute with the target item in user's behavior sequence. Such close relations mean the matching degrees between relational items and historical items should be highly affected by that of the target item and historical items. For example, given a relational item having relation complement with the target item, if the target item has high matching degrees with some items in user's behavior sequence, this complementary item should behave similarly for the co-occurrence of complementary items. Under guidance of the above thought, in this work, we propose a target-relation regulated mechanism which converts the biased knowledge of high correlation of matching degrees into a regulation. It integrates the target item and relational items in history as a whole to characterize the matching score between the target item and historical items. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform a set of state-of-the-art models.",False,True,,0.64960885,target-relation regulated network for sequential recommendation,,11.9533998,ok,,,trr,v2,0.9533998,TRR,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Pathology reports are routinely generated, more nuanced than structured data, and contain added insight from pathologists. However, there are no publicly available datasets for benchmarking report-based models. Two recent advances suggest the urgent need for a benchmark dataset. First, improved optical character recognition (OCR) techniques will make it possible to access older pathology reports in an automated way, increasing the data available for analysis. Second, recent improvements in natural language processing (NLP) techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) allow more accurate prediction of clinical targets from text.

Harnessing the power of fly genetics, we develop a comprehensive Drosophila COVID-19 resource (DCR) consisting of publicly available strains for conditional tissue-specific expression of all SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins, UAS-human cDNA transgenic lines encoding established host-viral interacting factors, and GAL4 insertion lines disrupting fly homologs of SARS-CoV-2 human interacting proteins. We demonstrate the utility of the DCR to functionally assess SARS-CoV-2 genes and candidate human binding partners. We show that NSP8 engages in strong genetic interactions with several human candidates, most prominently with the ATE1 arginyltransferase to induce actin arginylation and cytoskeletal disorganization, and that two ATE1 inhibitors can reverse NSP8 phenotypes.

Osteosarcoma is a malignant lesion caused by a malignant osteoid growing from primitive mesenchymal cells. In most cases, osteosarcoma develops as a solitary lesion within the most rapidly growing areas of the long bones in children. The distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus are the most frequently affected bones, but virtually any bone can be affected. Early detection can reduce mortality rates. Osteosarcoma's manual detection requires expertise, and it can be tedious. With the assistance of modern technology, medical images can now be analyzed and classified automatically, which enables faster and more efficient data processing. A deep learning-based automatic detection system based on whole slide images (WSIs) is presented in this paper to detect osteosarcoma automatically.

While animals exhibit a characteristic genome topology defined by topologically associating domains (TADs), plants display similar features with a more diverse conformation across species. Employing advanced high-throughput sequencing and microscopy techniques, we investigated the landscape of 26 histone modifications and RNA polymerase II distribution in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Our study unveiled a rich and nuanced epigenetic landscape, shedding light on distinct chromatin states associated with heterochromatin formation and gene silencing. Moreover, we elucidated the intricate interplay between these chromatin states and the overall topology of the genome. Employing a genetic approach, we delved into the role of the histone modification H3K9ac in genome topology. Notably, our investigation revealed that the ectopic deposition of this chromatin mark triggered a reorganization of the 3D chromatin structure, defining different TAD-like borders.

37640843,FGSI: distant supervision for relation extraction method based on fine-grained semantic information.,"Relation extraction is one of the important steps in building a knowledge graph. Its main objective is to extract semantic relationships from identified entity pairs in sentences, playing a crucial role in semantic understanding and knowledge graph construction. Remote supervised relation extraction aligns knowledge bases with natural language texts and generates labeled data, which alleviates the burden of manually annotating datasets. However, the labeled corpus obtained from remote supervision contains a large amount of noisy data, which greatly affects the training of relation extraction models. In this paper, we propose the hypothesis that key semantic information within the sentence plays a crucial role in entity relation extraction in the task of remote supervised relation extraction. Based on this hypothesis, we divide the sentence into three segments by splitting it according to the positions of entities, starting from within the sentence. Then, using intra-sentence attention mechanisms, we identify fine-grained semantic features within the sentence to reduce the interference of irrelevant noise information. We also improved the intra-bag attention mechanism by setting a threshold gate to filter out low-relevant noisy sentences, minimizing the impact of noise on the relation extraction model, and making full use of available positive semantic information. Experimental results show that the proposed relation extraction model in this paper achieves improvements in precision-recall curve, P@N value, and AUC value compared to existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of this model.",False,True,,0.68882596,distant supervision,,11.68467057,ok,,distant supervision for relation extraction method based on fine-grained semantic information,fgsi,v2,0.68467057,FGSI,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

The final step of the process is genome annotation, which works on assembled genome sequences to identify the location of genome features. In the case of organelle genomes, specialized annotation tools are used to identify organelle genes and structural features. Numerous annotation tools target chloroplast sequences. Most chloroplast DNA genomes have a quadripartite structure caused by two copies of a large inverted repeat.

39198545,Emotional palette: a computational mapping of aesthetic experiences evoked by visual art.,"Despite the evolutionary history and cultural significance of visual art, the structure of aesthetic experiences it evokes has only attracted recent scientific attention. What kinds of experience does visual art evoke? Guided by Semantic Space Theory, we identify the concepts that most precisely describe people's aesthetic experiences using new computational techniques. Participants viewed 1457 artworks sampled from diverse cultural and historical traditions and reported on the emotions they felt and their perceived artwork qualities. Results show that aesthetic experiences are high-dimensional, comprising 25 categories of feeling states. Extending well beyond hedonism and broad evaluative judgments (e.g., pleasant/unpleasant), aesthetic experiences involve emotions of daily social living (e.g., ""sad"", ""joy""), the imagination (e.g., ""psychedelic"", ""mysterious""), profundity (e.g., ""disgust"", ""awe""), and perceptual qualities attributed to the artwork (e.g., ""whimsical"", ""disorienting""). Aesthetic emotions and perceptual qualities jointly predict viewers' liking of the artworks, indicating that we conceptualize aesthetic experiences in terms of the emotions we feel but also the qualities we perceive in the artwork. Aesthetic experiences are often mixed and lie along continuous gradients between categories rather than within discrete clusters.

However, yoga postures can be complex and challenging, especially for beginners who may struggle with proper alignment and positioning. To address this issue, there is a need for a dataset of different yoga postures that can be used to develop computer vision algorithms capable of recognizing and analyzing yoga poses. For this we created the image and video datasets of different yoga asana using the mobile device Samsung Galaxy M30s. The dataset contains images and videos of effective (right) and ineffective postures for 10 Yoga asana, with a total of 11,344 images and 80 videos. The image dataset is organized into 10 subfolders, each with ""Effective (right) Steps"" and ""Ineffective (wrong) Steps"" folders. The video dataset has 4 videos for each posture, with 40 videos demonstrating effective (right) postures and 40 demonstrating ineffective (wrong) postures. This dataset benefits app developers, machine learning researchers, Yoga instructors, and practitioners, who can use it to develop apps, train computer vision algorithms, and improve their practice.

39567545,A Hyperspectral Reflectance Database of Plastic Debris with Different Fractional Abundance in River Systems.,"Plastic debris pollution transported by river systems to lakes and oceans has emerged as a significant environmental concern with adverse impacts on ecosystems, food webs, and human health. Remote sensing presents a cost-effective approach to bolster interception and removal efforts. However, unlike marine environments, the optical properties of plastic debris in fresh waters remain poorly understood. This study aims to address this gap by providing an open-access hyperspectral reflectance database of floating weathered and virgin plastic debris found in river systems under controlled laboratory experiments. Utilizing natural waters from the Mississippi River, the database was assembled using a remote sensing data acquisition system deployed over a hydraulic flume operating under subcritical flow conditions and varying suspended sediment concentrations. The measurements encompass hyperspectral diffused light reflectance from ultraviolet (UV, 350 nm) to shortwave infrared (SWIR, 2500 nm) wavelengths.

35586258,Database of Amphibia distribution in West Siberia (Russia).,"<h4>Background</h4>West Siberia is a large region in North Eurasia, which harbours multiple climatic zones, landscape types and biomes. Its amphibian fauna is characterised by a combination of European and Asian species. For many species, this region is the place where the limits of their global ranges are located (<i>Ranatemporaria</i>, <i>R.amurensis</i>, <i>Bufotessitibundus</i>). West Siberia also has at least two non-native amphibian species (<i>Pelophylaxridibundus</i>, <i>Bufotesviridis</i>). The exact ranges and patterns of distribution of the West Siberian amphibian species are poorly studied. The mapping of species ranges is important for the development of conservation measures and monitoring of invasive species is required to investigate their impacts on the natural ecosystems.<h4>New information</h4>This work presents the most complete biogeographic and occurrence records database of the amphibians of West Siberia. To assemble the database, we digitised data from 190 published works, obtained data from major museum collections and from the data bank on the abundance and distribution of animals «Zoomonitor» by the Zoomonitoring laboratory of the Institute of Systematics and Ecology of Animals, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences. The database also includes original and partly unpublished data collected by the authors from 1975 to 2021, as well as quality-assessed citizen science data from the iNaturalist portal.

39682316,Renal Disease in Cats and Dogs-Lessons Learned from Text-Mined Trends in Humans.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterised by progressive kidney damage and encompasses a broad range of renal pathologies and aetiologies. In humans, CKD is an increasing global health problem, in particular in the western world, while in cats and dogs, CKD is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Here, we aimed to develop an enhanced understanding of the knowledge base related to the pathophysiology of renal disease and CKD in cats and dogs. To achieve this, we leveraged a text-mining approach for reviewing trends in the literature and compared the findings to evidence collected from publications related to CKD in humans. Applying a quantitative text-mining technique, we examined data on clinical signs, diseases, clinical and lab methods, cell types, cytokine, and tissue associations (co-occurrences) captured in PubMed biomedical literature. Further, we examined different types of pain within human CKD-related publications, as publications on this topic are sparser in companion animals, but with the growing importance of animal welfare and quality of life, it is an area of interest. Our findings could serve as substance for future research studies. The systematic automated review of relevant literature, along with comparative analysis, has the potential to summarise scientific evidence and trends in a quick, easy, and cost-effective way.

38027538,Conjugated Polymer Process Ontology and Experimental Data Repository for Organic Field-Effect Transistors.,"Polymer-based semiconductors and organic electronics encapsulate a significant research thrust for informatics-driven materials development. However, device measurements are described by a complex array of design and parameter choices, many of which are sparsely reported. For example, the mobility of a polymer-based organic field-effect transistor (OFET) may vary by several orders of magnitude for a given polymer as a plethora of parameters related to solution processing, interface design/surface treatment, thin-film deposition, postprocessing, and measurement settings have a profound effect on the value of the final measurement. Incomplete contextual, experimental details hamper the availability of reusable data applicable for data-driven optimization, modeling (e.g., machine learning), and analysis of new organic devices. To curate organic device databases that contain reproducible and findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) experimental data records, data ontologies that fully describe sample provenance and process history are required. However, standards for generating such process ontologies are not widely adopted for experimental materials domains. In this work, we design and implement an object-relational database for storing experimental records of OFETs. A data structure is generated by drawing on an international standard for batch process control (ISA-88) to facilitate the design. We then mobilize these representative data records, curated from the literature and laboratory experiments, to enable data-driven learning of process-structure-property relationships.

38879569,Microscopy Image Dataset for Deep Learning-Based Quantitative Assessment of Pulmonary Vascular Changes.,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a syndrome complex that accompanies a number of diseases of different etiologies, associated with basic mechanisms of structural and functional changes of the pulmonary circulation vessels and revealed pressure increasing in the pulmonary artery. The structural changes in the pulmonary circulation vessels are the main limiting factor determining the prognosis of patients with PH. Thickening and irreversible deposition of collagen in the pulmonary artery branches walls leads to rapid disease progression and a therapy effectiveness decreasing. In this regard, histological examination of the pulmonary circulation vessels is critical both in preclinical studies and clinical practice. However, measurements of quantitative parameters such as the average vessel outer diameter, the vessel walls area, and the hypertrophy index claimed significant time investment and the requirement for specialist training to analyze micrographs. A dataset of pulmonary circulation vessels for pathology assessment using semantic segmentation techniques based on deep-learning is presented in this work. 609 original microphotographs of vessels, numerical data from experts' measurements, and microphotographs with outlines of these measurements for each of the vessels are presented. Furthermore, here we cite an example of a deep learning pipeline using the U-Net semantic segmentation model to extract vascular regions.

35733854,Stage Specific Transcriptomic Analysis and Database for Zebrafish Oogenesis.,"Oogenesis produces functional eggs and is essential for fertility, embryonic development, and reproduction. The zebrafish ovary is an excellent model to study oogenesis in vertebrates, and recent studies have identified multiple regulators in oocyte development through forward genetic screens, as well as reverse genetics by CRISPR mutagenesis. However, many developmental steps in oogenesis, in zebrafish and other species, remain poorly understood, and their underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we take a genomic approach to systematically uncover biological activities throughout oogenesis. We performed transcriptomic analysis on five stages of oogenesis, from the onset of oocyte differentiation through Stage III, which precedes oocyte maturation. These transcriptomes revealed thousands of differentially expressed genes across stages of oogenesis. We analyzed trends of gene expression dynamics along oogenesis, as well as their expression in pair-wise comparisons between stages. We determined their functionally enriched terms, identifying uniquely characteristic biological activities in each stage. These data identified two prominent developmental phases in oocyte differentiation and traced the accumulation of maternally deposited embryonic regulator transcripts in the developing oocyte. Our analysis provides the first molecular description for oogenesis in zebrafish, which we deposit online as a resource for the community. Further, the presence of multiple gene paralogs in zebrafish, and the exclusive curation by many bioinformatic tools of the single paralogs present in humans, challenge zebrafish genomic analyses. We offer an approach for converting zebrafish gene name nomenclature to the human nomenclature for supporting genomic analyses generally in zebrafish. Altogether, our work provides a valuable resource as a first step to uncover oogenesis mechanisms and candidate regulators and track accumulating transcripts of maternal regulators of embryonic development.",False,True,,0.7138495,stage specific transcriptomic analysis and database for zebrafish oogenesis,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Systematic curation and cross-validation of the scientific literature would provide a solid foundation for comparative genetic studies of the major molecular subtypes of lung cancer. Here, we constructed a literature-based lung cancer gene database (LCGene). In the current release, we collected and curated 2507 unique human genes, including 2267 protein-coding and 240 non-coding genes from comprehensive manual examination of 10,960 PubMed article abstracts. Extensive annotations were added to aid identification of differentially expressed genes, potential gene editing sites, and non-coding gene regulation. For instance, we prepared 607 curated genes with CRISPR knockout information in 43 lung cancer cell lines. Further comparison of these implicated genes among different subtypes identified several subtype-specific genes with high mutational frequencies. Common tumor suppressors and oncogenes shared by lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, for example, exhibited different mutational frequencies and prognostic features, suggesting the presence of subtype-specific biomarkers. Our retrospective analysis revealed 43 small cell lung cancer-specific genes. Moreover, 52 tumor suppressors and oncogenes shared by lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma confirmed the different molecular mechanisms of these two cancer subtypes.

37192099,Discovery of Diverse CRISPR-Cas Systems and Expansion of the Genome Engineering Toolbox.,"CRISPR systems mediate adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea through diverse effector mechanisms and have been repurposed for versatile applications in therapeutics and diagnostics thanks to their facile reprogramming with RNA guides. RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas targeting and interference are mediated by effectors that are either components of multisubunit complexes in class 1 systems or multidomain single-effector proteins in class 2. The compact class 2 CRISPR systems have been broadly adopted for multiple applications, especially genome editing, leading to a transformation of the molecular biology and biotechnology toolkit. The diversity of class 2 effector enzymes, initially limited to the Cas9 nuclease, was substantially expanded via computational genome and metagenome mining to include numerous variants of Cas12 and Cas13, providing substrates for the development of versatile, orthogonal molecular tools. Characterization of these diverse CRISPR effectors uncovered many new features, including distinct protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) that expand the targeting space, improved editing specificity, RNA rather than DNA targeting, smaller crRNAs, staggered and blunt end cuts, miniature enzymes, promiscuous RNA and DNA cleavage, etc. These unique properties enabled multiple applications, such as harnessing the promiscuous RNase activity of the type VI effector, Cas13, for supersensitive nucleic acid detection. class 1 CRISPR systems have been adopted for genome editing, as well, despite the challenge of expressing and delivering the multiprotein class 1 effectors. The rich diversity of CRISPR enzymes led to rapid maturation of the genome editing toolbox, with capabilities such as gene knockout, base editing, prime editing, gene insertion, DNA imaging, epigenetic modulation, transcriptional modulation, and RNA editing.

In comparison with previous methods, this microfluidic platform can make, incubate, and measure samples in a few minutes, uses just 20 μg of protein (>10-fold improvement), and yields 10,000 data points (1000-fold improvement). This allows quantitative comparison of formulation excipients, such as sodium chloride, polysorbate, histidine, arginine, and sucrose. Additionally, we can measure how solubility is affected by the combinatorial effect of multiple additives, find a suitable pH for the formulation, and measure the impact of mutations on solubility, thus enabling the screening of large libraries.

37766241,Navigating the Landscape: A Comprehensive Review of Current Virus Databases.,"Viruses are abundant and diverse entities that have important roles in public health, ecology, and agriculture. The identification and surveillance of viruses rely on an understanding of their genome organization, sequences, and replication strategy. Despite technological advancements in sequencing methods, our current understanding of virus diversity remains incomplete, highlighting the need to explore undiscovered viruses. Virus databases play a crucial role in providing access to sequences, annotations and other metadata, and analysis tools for studying viruses. However, there has not been a comprehensive review of virus databases in the last five years. This study aimed to fill this gap by identifying 24 active virus databases and included an extensive evaluation of their content, functionality and compliance with the FAIR principles. In this study, we thoroughly assessed the search capabilities of five database catalogs, which serve as comprehensive repositories housing a diverse array of databases and offering essential metadata. Moreover, we conducted a comprehensive review of different types of errors, encompassing taxonomy, names, missing information, sequences, sequence orientation, and chimeric sequences, with the intention of empowering users to effectively tackle these challenges. We expect this review to aid users in selecting suitable virus databases and other resources, and to help databases in error management and improve their adherence to the FAIR principles. The databases listed here represent the current knowledge of viruses and will help aid users find databases of interest based on content, functionality, and scope. The use of virus databases is integral to gaining new insights into the biology, evolution, and transmission of viruses, and developing new strategies to manage virus outbreaks and preserve global health.",False,True,,0.6826502,a comprehensive review of current virus databases,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Navigating the Landscape,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37553326,spinDrop: a droplet microfluidic platform to maximise single-cell sequencing information content.,"Droplet microfluidic methods have massively increased the throughput of single-cell sequencing campaigns. The benefit of scale-up is, however, accompanied by increased background noise when processing challenging samples and the overall RNA capture efficiency is lower. These drawbacks stem from the lack of strategies to enrich for high-quality material or specific cell types at the moment of cell encapsulation and the absence of implementable multi-step enzymatic processes that increase capture. Here we alleviate both bottlenecks using fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to enrich for droplets that contain single viable cells, intact nuclei, fixed cells or target cell types and use reagent addition to droplets by picoinjection to perform multi-step lysis and reverse transcription. Our methodology increases gene detection rates fivefold, while reducing background noise by up to half. We harness these properties to deliver a high-quality molecular atlas of mouse brain development, despite starting with highly damaged input material, and provide an atlas of nascent RNA transcription during mouse organogenesis. Our method is broadly applicable to other droplet-based workflows to deliver sensitive and accurate single-cell profiling at a reduced cost.",False,True,,0.6877741,spindrop | a droplet microfluidic platform to maximise single-cell sequencing information content,,11.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,spinDrop,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In order to store, access, compare, validate, classify, and understand the massive data generated by different researchers, and to promote effective communication among research communities, various genome and cytogenetic online databases have been established. These data platforms/resources are essential not only for computational analyses and theoretical syntheses but also for helping researchers select future research topics and prioritize molecular targets. Furthermore, they are valuable for identifying shared recurrent genomic patterns related to human diseases and for avoiding unnecessary duplications among different researchers. The website interface, menu, graphics, animations, text layout, and data from databases are displayed by a front end on the screen of a monitor or smartphone. A database front-end refers to the user interface or application that enables accessing tabular, structured, or raw data stored in the database. The Internet makes it possible to reach a greater number of users around the world and gives them quick access to information stored in databases. The number of ways of presenting this data by front-ends increases as well. This requires unifying the ways of operating and presenting information by front-ends and ensuring contextual switching between front-ends of different databases. This chapter aims to present selected cytogenetic and cytogenomic Internet resources in terms of obtaining the needed information and to indicate how to increase the efficiency of access to stored information.

The underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, a droplet-based microfluidic platform is presented to identify and select NK cells with serial killing ability. To this end, primary human NK cells are encapsulated with several target cells using an efficient negative pressure-based droplet generator. Capitalizing on the large number of possible killing events due to quantization into droplets, a convolutional neural network analysis pipeline is developed to quantify the cytotoxicity and abundance of serial killing events with high accuracy. To physically select NK cells based on their serial killing ability, MultiCell-Sort - an advanced real-time image-based droplet sorting module - is presented. While conventional single-cell sorters mostly evaluate intrinsically-encoded properties, such as protein expression levels, MultiCell-Sort can select living NK cells based on complex functional phenotypes emerging from multiple cell-cell interactions within the droplet.

Plant synthetic biology, particularly chloroplast engineering, holds promise as a viable approach to this challenge. Chloroplasts present a variety of advantageous traits for genetic engineering, but the development of genetic tools and genetic part characterization in these organelles is hindered by the lengthy time scales required to generate transplastomic organisms. To address these challenges, we have established a versatile protocol for generating highly active chloroplast-based cell-free gene expression (CFE) systems derived from a diverse range of plant species, including wheat (monocot), spinach, and poplar trees (dicots). We show that these systems work with conventionally used T7 RNA polymerase as well as the endogenous chloroplast polymerases, allowing for detailed characterization and prototyping of regulatory sequences at both transcription and translation levels. To demonstrate the platform for characterization of promoters and 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) in higher plant chloroplast gene expression, we analyze a collection of 23 5'UTRs, 10 3'UTRs, and 6 chloroplast promoters, assessed their expression in spinach and wheat extracts, and found consistency in expression patterns, suggesting cross-species compatibility.

35178077,Data Collection Strategy Based on OSELM and Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks.,"In order to effectively reduce the energy consumption, improve the efficiency of data collection in HWSNs, and prolong the lifetime of the overall network, the clustering method is one of the most effective methods in the data collection methods for HWSNs. The data collection strategy of HWSNs based on the clustering method mainly includes three stages: (1) selecting the appropriate cluster head, (2) forming between clusters, and (3) transferring data between clusters. Among them, the selection of the cluster heads in the first stage. The optimal number of cluster heads in the formation of clusters in the second stage is the core and key to the clustering data collection of HWSNs. In the stage of cluster head selection, a data collection strategy for HWSNs based on the clustering method is proposed. Sink establishes an extreme learning machine neural network model. The cluster member nodes select cluster heads based on the remaining energy of the sensor node, the number of the neighbor node, and the distance to the sink. The best cluster head node is selected through the adaptive learning of the online sequence extreme learning machine. Through comprehensive consideration of various factors to complete the clustering process, the gray wolf algorithm is used to optimize the number of clusters, balance the effect of clustering, and improve the efficiency of data collection while reducing energy consumption. An energy efficient and reliable clustering data collection strategy for HWSNs based on the online sequence extreme learning machine and the gray wolf optimization algorithm is proposed in this paper. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only significantly improves the efficiency of the data collection and reduces energy consumption but also comprehensively improves the reliability of the network and prolongs the network's lifetime.",False,True,,0.6149556,data collection strategy based on oselm,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To tackle this issue, we have devised an efficient deep learning-based approach that promises to revolutionize how we estimate food leftovers. Our first step was creating the LeFoodSet dataset, a pioneering large-scale open dataset explicitly designed for estimating food leftovers. This dataset is unique in its ability to estimate leftover rates and types of food. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive dataset for this type of analysis. The dataset comprises 524 image pairs representing 34 Indonesian food categories, each with images captured before and after consumption.

37668974,Using Linear Motif Database Resources to Identify SH2 Domain Binders.,"The SH2-binding phosphotyrosine class of short linear motifs (SLiMs) are key conditional regulatory elements, particularly in signaling protein complexes beneath the cell's plasma membrane. In addition to transmitting cellular signaling information, they can also play roles in cellular hijack by invasive pathogens. Researchers can take advantage of bioinformatics tools and resources to predict the motifs at conserved phosphotyrosine residues in regions of intrinsically disordered protein. A candidate SH2-binding motif can be established and assigned to one or more of the SH2 domain subgroups. It is, however, not so straightforward to predict which SH2 domains are capable of binding the given candidate. This is largely due to the cooperative nature of the binding amino acids which enables poorer binding residues to be tolerated when the other residues are optimal. High-throughput peptide arrays are powerful tools used to derive SH2 domain-binding specificity, but they are unable to capture these cooperative effects and also suffer from other shortcomings. Tissue and cell type expression can help to restrict the list of available interactors: for example, some well-studied SH2 domain proteins are only present in the immune cell lineages. In this article, we provide a table of motif patterns and four bioinformatics strategies that introduce a range of tools that can be used in motif hunting in cellular and pathogen proteins. Experimental followup is essential to determine which SH2 domain/motif-containing proteins are the actual functional partners.",False,True,,0.6890732,linear motif database resources to identify sh2 domain binders,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,8.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Therefore, the emergence of any new technology in this field is a significant event, especially because previous technologies have not yielded results. Recently, the development of a cancer vaccine has been complemented by a new proteomics technology platform that allows the creation of antigen compositions known as antigenic essences. Antigenic essence comprises a target fraction of cellular antigens, the composition of which is precisely controlled by peptide mass spectrometry and compared to the proteomic footprint of the target cells to ensure similarity. This proteomics platform offers potential for a massive upgrade of conventional cellular cancer vaccines. Antigenic essences have the same mechanism of action, but without the disadvantages, and with notable advantages such as precise targeting of the immune response, safety, controlled composition, improved immunogenicity, addressed MHC restriction, and extended range of vaccination doses. The present paper calls attention to this novel platform, stimulates discussion of the role of antigenic essence in vaccine development, and consolidates academic science with biotech capabilities. A brief description of the platform, list of cellular cancer vaccines suitable for the upgrade, main recommendations, limitations, and legal and ethical aspects of vaccine upgrade are reported here.",False,True,,0.6062767,changing landscape of cancer vaccines-novel proteomics platform for new antigen compositions,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40192223,The Molecular Toolbox for Linkage Type-Specific Analysis of Ubiquitin Signaling.,"Modification of proteins and other biomolecules with ubiquitin regulates virtually all aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. Ubiquitin can be attached to substrates as a monomer or as an array of polyubiquitin chains with defined linkages between the ubiquitin moieties. Each ubiquitin linkage type adopts a distinct structure, enabling the individual linkage types to mediate specific functions or outcomes in the cell. The dynamics, heterogeneity, and in some cases low abundance, make analysis of linkage type-specific ubiquitin signaling a challenging and complex task. Herein, the strategies and molecular tools available for enrichment, detection, and characterization of linkage type-specific ubiquitin signaling, are reviewed. The molecular ""toolbox"" consists of a range of molecularly different affinity reagents, including antibodies and antibody-like molecules, affimers, engineered ubiquitin-binding domains, catalytically inactive deubiquitinases, and macrocyclic peptides, each with their unique characteristics and binding modes. The molecular engineering of these ubiquitin-binding molecules makes them useful tools and reagents that can be coupled to a range of analytical methods, such as immunoblotting, fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, or enzymatic analyses to aid in deciphering the ever-expanding complexity of ubiquitin modifications.",False,True,,0.65863144,molecular toolbox for linkage type-specific analysis of ubiquitin signaling,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

However, despite considerable therapeutic efficacy, severe toxicity-associated problems, which are mainly caused by the non-specific mode of action such as chromosomal DNA damage and interference in the DNA replication even in normal cells, remain unresolved and a major challenge for safer and thus more widespread adoption of chemotherapy. Herein, an innovative platform is developed through beneficially integrating core peptide units into highly-ordered, stable, and flexibly guest-adaptable structure of apoferritin, which simultaneously fulfills high-capacity loading of chemotherapeutic drugs compared with the case of FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugates, efficient drug targeting to cancer cells, and cancer cell-specific drug release and activation. This approach dramatically reduces drug toxicity to normal cells, significantly enhances efficacy in in vivo cancer treatment without toxicity to normal organs of mice, and thus is expected to open up a novel clinical route to break through the limits of current cancer chemotherapy.",False,True,,0.6020059,optimally fabricated platform guides cancer-specific activation of chemotherapeutic drugs and toxicity-free cancer treatment,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

36227552,Machine Learning Using Neural Networks for Metabolomic Pathway Analyses.,"Elucidating the mechanisms of metabolic pathways helps us understand the cascade of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that lead to the conversion of substances into final products. This has implications for predicting how newly synthesized compounds will affect a person's metabolism and, hence, the development of novel treatments to improve one's health. The study of metabolomic pathways, together with protein engineering, may also aid in the extraction, at a scale, of natural products to be used as drugs and drug precursors. Several approaches have been used to correlate protein annotations to metabolic pathways in order to derive pathways directly related to specific organisms. These could range from association rule-mining techniques to machine learning methods such as decision trees, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and ensemble methods.In this chapter, we will be reviewing the use of machine learning for metabolic pathway analyses, with a step-by-step focus on the use of deep learning to predict the association of compounds (metabolites) to their respective metabolomic pathway classes. This prediction could help explain interactions of small molecules in organisms. Inspired by the work of Baranwal et al. (2019), we demonstrate how to build and train a deep learning neural network model to perform a multi-label prediction. We considered two different types of fingerprints as features (inputs to the model). The output of the model is the set of metabolic pathway classes (from the KEGG dataset) in which the input molecule participates. We will walk through the various steps of this process, including data collection, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

Herein, a review of graph ML methods and their applications in the disease prediction domain based on electronic health data is presented in this study from two levels: node classification and link prediction. Commonly used graph ML approaches for these two levels are shallow embedding and graph neural networks (GNN). This study performs comprehensive research to identify articles that applied or proposed graph ML models on disease prediction using electronic health data. We considered journals and conferences from four digital library databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, ACM digital library, and IEEEXplore). Based on the identified articles, we review the present status of and trends in graph ML approaches for disease prediction using electronic health data. Even though GNN-based models have achieved outstanding results compared with the traditional ML methods in a wide range of disease prediction tasks, they still confront interpretability and dynamic graph challenges. Though the disease prediction field using ML techniques is still emerging, GNN-based models have the potential to be an excellent approach for disease prediction, which can be used in medical diagnosis, treatment, and the prognosis of diseases.",False,True,,0.6572959,disease prediction using graph machine learning based on,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Disease Prediction Using Graph Machine Learning Based on Electronic Health Data,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In addition, because of the open nature of the wireless channel, authentication is a critical issue in wireless communications. Physical layer authentication (PLA) is based on distinctive features to provide information-theory security and low complexity. However, although many researchers are interested in the PLA and how it might be used to improve wireless security, there is surprisingly little literature on the subject, with no systematic overview of the current state-of-the-art PLA and the main foundations involved. Therefore, this paper aims to determine and systematically compare existing studies in the physical layer authentication. This study showed whether machine learning approaches in physical layer authentication models increased wireless network security performance and demonstrated the latest techniques used in PLA.

For the rapid annotation of whole genome sequencing and metagenomic results considering antibiotic resistance, several tools and data resources were developed. These databases, however, can differ fundamentally in the number and type of genes and resistance determinants they comprise. Furthermore, the annotation structure and metadata stored in these resources can also contribute to their differences.

Thanks to the digital revolution, large data sets are now accessible, which also enables real-time epidemic tracking. However, despite this, academic faculty and their trainees have been struggling to access comprehensive clinical data. To tackle this issue, we have devised a clinical data repository that streamlines research processes and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to present an easily accessible up-to-date database that promotes access to local COVID-19 clinical data, thereby increasing efficiency, streamlining, and democratizing the research enterprise. By providing a robust database, a broad range of researchers (faculty and trainees) and clinicians from different areas of medicine are encouraged to explore and collaborate on novel clinically relevant research questions.<h4>Methods</h4>A research platform, called the Yale Department of Medicine COVID-19 Explorer and Repository (DOM-CovX), was constructed to house cleaned, highly granular, deidentified, and continually updated data from over 18,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 2020 to January 2023, across the Yale New Haven Health System. Data across several key domains were extracted including demographics, past medical history, laboratory values during hospitalization, vital signs, medications, imaging, procedures, and outcomes. Given the time-varying nature of several data domains, summary statistics were constructed to limit the computational size of the database and provide a reasonable data file that the broader research community could use for basic statistical analyses. The initiative also included a front-end user interface, the DOM-CovX Explorer, for simple data visualization of aggregate data. The detailed clinical data sets were made available for researchers after a review board process.<h4>Results</h4>As of January 2023, the DOM-CovX Explorer has received 38 requests from different groups of scientists at Yale and the repository has expanded research capability to a diverse group of stakeholders including clinical and research-based faculty and trainees within 15 different surgical and nonsurgical specialties. A dedicated DOM-CovX team guides access and use of the database, which has enhanced interdepartmental collaborations, resulting in the publication of 16 peer-reviewed papers, 2 projects available in preprint servers, and 8 presentations in scientific conferences. Currently, the DOM-CovX Explorer continues to expand and improve its interface. The repository includes up to 3997 variables across 7 different clinical domains, with continued growth in response to researchers' requests and data availability.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The DOM-CovX Data Explorer and Repository is a user-friendly tool for analyzing data and accessing a consistently updated, standardized, and large-scale database. Its innovative approach fosters collaboration, diversity of scholarly pursuits, and expands medical education.

The first WGS-based datasets have already been released including underrepresented populations. Although many databases contain pooled data from several cohorts, recently the importance of local databases has been highlighted. Genomic databases are not only collecting data but may also contribute to better diagnostics and therapies. They may find applications in population studies, rare diseases, oncology, pharmacogenetics, and infectious and inflammatory diseases. Further data may be analysed with Al technologies and in the context of other omics data.

A systematic workflow was established using robust, reproducible in vivo models and standardized methods to identify novel players in melanoma metastasis. This approach allows for data inference at specific experimental stages to precisely characterize a gene's role in metastasis. Models are established by introducing genetically modified melanoma cells via intracardiac, intradermal, or subcutaneous injections into mice, followed by monitoring with serial in vivo imaging. Once preestablished endpoints are reached, primary tumors and/or metastases-bearing organs are harvested and processed for various analyses. Tumor cells can be sorted and subjected to any of several 'omics' platforms, including single-cell RNA sequencing. Organs undergo imaging and immunohistopathological analyses to quantify the overall burden of metastases and map their specific anatomic location.

Meanwhile, the clinical detection capability of this sensor was further verified using gold-standard real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction through <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> measurement, which demonstrated its good reliability for practical applications.

Although most comparative MRI studies of human and nonhuman primate brains have been based on brains of primates that had been used as subjects in experiments, it is essential to investigate various species of nonhuman primates in order to elucidate and interpret the diversity of neuroanatomy features among humans and nonhuman primates. To develop a research platform for this purpose, it is necessary to harmonize the scientific contributions of studies with the standards of animal ethics, animal welfare, and the conservation of brain information for long-term continuation of the field.

Our image repository should facilitate scientific discoveries in the field of comparative neuroscience. This repository can also promote animal ethics and animal welfare in experiments with nonhuman primate models by optimizing methods for in vivo and ex vivo MRI scanning of brains and supporting veterinary neuroradiological education.

Binning of metagenomic contigs is a hot topic in metagenomics research. There are two key challenges for the current unsupervised metagenomic clustering algorithms. First, unsupervised metagenomic clustering methods rarely use reference databases, causing a certain waste of resources. Second, unsupervised metagenomic clustering methods are restricted by the characteristics of the sequences and the clustering algorithms, and the binning effect is limited. Therefore, a new binning method for metagenomic contigs using unsupervised clustering methods and reference databases is proposed to address these challenges, to make full use of the advantages of unsupervised clustering methods and reference databases constructed by scientists to improve the overall binning effect. This method uses the integrated SVM classification model to further bin the unsupervised clustering parts that do not perform well. Our proposed method was tested on simulated datasets and a real dataset and compared with other state-of-the-art metagenomic clustering methods including CONCOCT, Metabin2.0, Autometa, and MetaBAT.

With this extensive knowledge of its cell and molecular biology, S. pombe also holds promise for use in metabolism research and industrial applications. However, unlike the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a major workhorse in these areas, cell physiology and metabolism of S. pombe remain less explored. One way to advance understanding of organism-specific metabolism is construction of computational models and their use for hypothesis testing. To this end, we leverage existing knowledge of S. cerevisiae to generate a manually curated high-quality reconstruction of S. pombe<i>'s</i> metabolic network, including a proteome-constrained version of the model. Using these models, we gain insights into the energy demands for growth, as well as ribosome kinetics in S. pombe. Furthermore, we predict proteome composition and identify growth-limiting constraints that determine optimal metabolic strategies under different glucose availability regimes and reproduce experimentally determined metabolic profiles. Notably, we find similarities in metabolic and proteome predictions of S. pombe with S. cerevisiae, which indicate that similar cellular resource constraints operate to dictate metabolic organization. With these cases, we show, on the one hand, how these models provide an efficient means to transfer metabolic knowledge from a well-studied to a lesser-studied organism, and on the other, how they can successfully be used to explore the metabolic behavior and the role of resource allocation in driving different strategies in fission yeast. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Our understanding of microbial metabolism relies mostly on the knowledge we have obtained from a limited number of model organisms, and the diversity of metabolism beyond the handful of model species thus remains largely unexplored in mechanistic terms. Computational modeling of metabolic networks offers an attractive platform to bridge the knowledge gap and gain new insights into physiology of lesser-studied organisms.

It allows sampling droplets loaded with molecules from the brain extracellular fluid punctually, without the long transient equilibration periods typical of continuous methods. It uses an accurately defined fluidic sequence with controlled timings, volumes, and flow rates, and correct operation is verified by the embedded electrodes and a flow sensor. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the application of this novel approach <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, to collect glucose in the brain of mice, with a temporal resolution of 1-2 min and without transient regime. Absolute quantification of the glucose level in the samples was performed by direct infusion nanoelectrospray ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (nanoESI-FTMS). By adjusting the diffusion time and the perfusion volume of DoD, the fraction of molecules recovered in the samples can be tuned to mirror the tissue concentration at accurate points in time. Moreover, this makes quantification of biomarkers in the brain possible within acute experiments of only 20-120 min.

The fossil record suggests that human colonisation of the Balearic Islands resulted in a sharp decrease of the Balearic shearwater population size. Currently, populations of the species continue to be decimated mainly due to predation by introduced mammals and bycatch in longline fisheries, with some studies predicting its extinction by 2070. Here, using a combination of short and long reads, we generate the first high-quality reference genome for the Balearic shearwater, with a completeness amongst the highest across available avian species. We used this reference genome to study critical aspects relevant to the conservation status of the species and to gain insights into the adaptation to a pelagic lifestyle of the order Procellariiformes. We detected relatively high levels of genome-wide heterozygosity in the Balearic shearwater despite its reduced population size. However, the reconstruction of its historical demography uncovered an abrupt population decline potentially linked to a reduction of the neritic zone during the Penultimate Glacial Period (∼194-135 ka). Comparative genomics analyses uncover a set of candidate genes that may have played an important role into the adaptation to a pelagic lifestyle of Procellariiformes, including those for the enhancement of fishing capabilities, night vision, and the development of natriuresis.

As a consequence, the interest in plant molecular farming aimed at producing the desired therapeutic proteins has significantly increased. Since the middle of the 1980s, recombinant pharmaceuticals have transformed the treatment of many serious diseases and nowadays are used in all branches of medicine. The available systems of the synthesis include wild-type or modified mammalian cells, plants or plant cell cultures, insects, yeast, fungi, or bacteria. Undeniable benefits such as well-characterised breeding conditions, safety, and relatively low costs of production make plants an attractive yet competitive platform for biopharmaceutical production. Some of the vegetable plants that have edible tubers, fruits, leaves, or seeds may be desirable as inexpensive bioreactors because these organs can provide edible vaccines and thus omit the purification step of the final product. Some crucial facts in the development of plant-made pharmaceuticals are presented here in brief. Although crop systems do not require more strictly dedicated optimization of methodologies at any stages of the of biopharmaceutical production process, here we recall the complete framework of such a project, along with theoretical background. Thus, a brief review of the advantages and disadvantages of different systems, the principles for the selection of <i>cis</i> elements for the expression cassettes, and available methods of plant transformation, through to the protein recovery and purification stage, are all presented here.

The advent of combinational design has notably accelerated the generation of chemical libraries, offering numerous candidates for the development of robust sensor arrays. However, screening elements with superior cross-responsiveness remains challenging, impeding the development of high-performance sensor arrays. Herein, we propose a new deep learning-assisted, two-step screening strategy to identify the optimal combination of minimal sensor elements, using a designed volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-targeted sensor library. 400 sensing elements constructed by pairing 20 ionizable cationic elements and 20 anionic dyes in the sensor library were employed for various VOCs, generating plentiful color variation data. By employing a feedforward neural network─random forest-recursive feature elimination (FRR) algorithm, sensing elements were effectively screened, resulting in the rapidly producing 8-element and 10-element arrays for two VOC models, both achieving 100% discrimination accuracy. Furthermore, a smartphone-based point-of-care testing (POCT) platform achieved cancer discrimination in a simulated cancer VOC model, using image-based deep learning, demonstrating the rationality and practicality of deep learning in the assembly of sensor elements for parallel sensing platforms.",False,True,,0.66734594,design of multi-cancer vocs profiling platform,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Particularly, over the last seventy years, the amount of radiobiological data has considerably increased, and permitted the mathematical formulas describing dose-response to become less empirical. A better understanding of the basic radiobiological mechanisms has also contributed to establish quantitative inter-correlations between clinical, biological and molecular biomarkers, refining again the mathematical models of description. Today, big data approaches and, more recently, artificial intelligence may finally complete and secure this long process of thinking from the multi-scale description of radiation-induced events to their prediction. Here, we reviewed the major dose-response models applied in radiobiology for quantifying molecular and cellular radiosensitivity and aimed to explain their evolution: Specifically, we highlighted the advances concerning the target theory with the cell survival models and the progressive introduction of the DNA repair process in the mathematical models. Furthermore, we described how the technological advances have changed the description of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair kinetics by introducing the important notion of DSB recognition, independent of that of DSB repair.

Those few exceptions to this rule (e.g., glucose, pyruvate, the monoamines) are monitored using ""one-off"" technologies reliant on the specific enzymatic or redox reactivity of their targets, and thus not generalizable to the measurement of other targets. In response we have developed in vivo electrochemical aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors, a modular, receptor-based measurement technology that is independent of the chemical reactivity of its targets, and thus has the potential to be generalizable to a wide range of analytes.

Introducing controllable gradients to anisotropic biomaterials is critical for the next generation of bioactive biomaterials. Current strategies for introducing gradients to anisotropic biomaterials are highly limited to special cues with inferior controllability. Here, beta-sheet rich silk nanofibers (B-SNFs) are exploited to build aligned hydrogels with controllable gradients, providing a universal approach to fabricating different gradients in anisotropic hydrogels. B-SNFs as carriers are loaded with gradient cues in aqueous solutions, and then the gradients on the aligned hydrogels under the electrical field are stabilized due to their stagnant behaviors in aqueous solutions and directional movement under the electrical field. The anisotropy, gradient strength/type, and gradient interval of the hydrogels are regulated through tuning the B-SNF concentration, the gradients of cues in solution, and the intervals of the compartments, suggesting good controllability. Both biological and physical gradient cues are effectively introduced to the aligned hydrogels and exhibit efficient gradient control of cell behavior.

Despite their global distribution and role as vectors of pathogens such as Rickettsia spp., ticks in the genus Dermacentor Koch, 1844 (Acari: Ixodidae) have recently received less attention than ticks in the genus Ixodes Latreille, 1795 (Acari: Ixodidae). To address this knowledge gap, we compiled an extensive database of Dermacentor tick traits, including morphological characteristics, host range, and geographic distribution. Zoonotic vector status was determined by compiling information about zoonotic pathogens found in Dermacentor species derived from primary literature and data repositories. We trained a machine learning algorithm on this data set to assess which traits were the most important predictors of zoonotic vector status. Our model successfully classified vector species with ~84% accuracy (mean AUC) and identified two additional Dermacentor species as potential zoonotic vectors. Our results suggest that Dermacentor species that are most likely to be zoonotic vectors are broad ranging, both in terms of the range of hosts they infest and the range of ecoregions across which they are found, and also tend to have large hypostomes and be small-bodied as immature ticks. Beyond the patterns we observed, high spatial and species-level resolution of this new, synthetic dataset has the potential to support future analyses of public health relevance, including species distribution modeling and predictive analytics, to draw attention to emerging or newly identified Dermacentor species that warrant closer monitoring for zoonotic pathogens.",False,True,,0.6427435,ecological predictors of zoonotic vector status among dermacentor ticks,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Ecological Predictors of Zoonotic Vector Status Among Dermacentor Ticks (Acari,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39704048,The Emergence of Oligonucleotide Building Blocks in the Multispecific Proximity-Inducing Drug Toolbox of Destruction.,"Oligonucleotides are a rapidly emerging class of therapeutics. Their most well-known examples are informational drugs that modify gene expression by binding mRNA. Despite inducing proximity between biological machinery and mRNA when applied to modulating gene expression, oligonucleotides are not typically labeled as ""proximity-inducing"" in literature. Yet, they have recently been explored as building blocks for multispecific proximity-inducing drugs (MPIDs). MPIDs are unique because they can direct endogenous biological machinery to destroy targeted molecules and cells, in contrast to traditional drugs that inhibit only their functions. The unique mechanism of action of MPIDs has enabled the targeting of previously ""undruggable"" molecular entities that cannot be effectively inhibited. However, the development of MPIDs must ensure that these molecules will selectively direct a potent, destruction-based mechanism of action toward intended targets over healthy tissues to avoid causing life-threatening toxicities. Oligonucleotides have emerged as promising building blocks for the design of MPIDs because they are sequence-controlled molecules that can be rationally designed to program multispecific binding interactions. In this Review, we examine the emergence of oligonucleotide-containing MPIDs in the proximity induction space, which has been dominated by antibody and small molecule MPID modalities. Moreover, examples of oligonucleotides developed as MPID candidates in immunotherapy and protein degradation are discussed to demonstrate the utility of oligonucleotides in expanding the scope and selectivity of the MPID toolbox. Finally, we discuss the utility of programming ""AND"" gates into oligonucleotide scaffolds to encode conditional responses that have the potential to be incorporated into MPIDs, which can further enhance their selectivity, thus increasing the scope of this drug category.",False,True,,0.6505102,emergence of oligonucleotide building blocks,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

We review how genome sequencing coupled with metabolomics can facilitate the screening of genebank collections in the search for superior alleles related to the nutritional quality of crops. We argue that the first examples are very promising, suggesting that this approach could benefit broader ranges of crops and compounds with known relevance for human health.

Over the past decade, substantial efforts have been directed towards the exploration of innovative methodologies for developing new materials. These efforts encompass enhancements to existing products or processes and the design of novel materials. Of particular significance is the synthesis of specific polymers through the copolymerization of epoxides with CO<sub>2</sub>. However, several uncertainties emerge in this chemical process, including challenges associated with successful polymerization and the properties of the resulting materials. These uncertainties render the design of new polymers a trial-and-error endeavor, often resulting in failed outcomes that entail significant financial, human resource, and time investments due to unsuccessful experimentation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising technology to mitigate these drawbacks during the experimental phase. Nonetheless, the availability of high-quality data remains crucial, posing particular challenges in the context of polymeric materials, mainly because of the stochastic nature of polymers, which impedes their homogeneous representation, and the variation in their properties based on their processing. In this study, the first dataset linking the structure of the epoxy comonomer, the catalyst employed, and the experimental conditions of polymerization to the reaction's success is described. A novel analytical pipeline based on ML to effectively exploit the constructed database is introduced. The initial results underscore the importance of addressing the dimensionality problem. The outcomes derived from the proposed analytical pipeline, which infer the molecular weight, polydispersity index, and conversion rate, demonstrate promising adjustment values for all target parameters. The best results are measured in terms of the (Determination Coefficient) R2 between real and predicted values for all three target magnitudes.

40114309,Solar Evaporators for Saline Water: Sustainable Clean Water Harvesting and Critical Mineral Resources Extraction.,"Solar-driven interfacial water evaporation (SIWE) can efficiently utilize solar energy to separate or extract various ions from saline water, providing an environmentally friendly, economical, and sustainable approach to clean water and critical mineral resources harvesting. However, for ongoing practical implementation, solid salt accumulation at the interface will inevitably impair the SIWE performance, while direct disposal of residual concentrated brine poses significant environmental risks. As such, advancing solar evaporators for sustainable clean water harvesting and critical mineral resources extraction is pivotal in the resources-energy-environment nexus. Critically, this review spotlights the latest research progress in engineering nonselective salt-rejecting solar evaporators (NS-SRSEs) for sustainable desalination, emphasizing interfacial structural design and surface modification. We then delineate our endeavors aimed at the construction strategies of selective salt-extraction solar evaporators (S-SESEs) for getting access to critical mineral resources such as uranium and lithium. Finally, current challenges and opportunities are outlined in the high-value saline water utilization of NS-SRSE and S-SESE for real-world applications that balance high efficiency, durability, and adaptability with a low environmental impact.

Despite the development of several protein conjugation strategies in recent years, the ability to modify one specific amino acid residue on a protein in the presence of other reactive side chains remains a challenge. We show that monosubstituted cyclopropenone (CPO) reagents react selectively with the 1,2-aminothiol groups of N-terminal cysteine residues to give a stable 1,4-thiazepan-5-one linkage under mild, biocompatible conditions. The CPO-based reagents, all accessible from a common activated ester CPO-pentafluorophenol (<b>CPO-PFP</b>), allow selective modification of N-terminal cysteine-containing peptides and proteins even in the presence of internal, solvent-exposed cysteine residues. This approach enabled the preparation of a dual protein conjugate of <b>2</b>×<b>cys-GFP</b>, containing both internal and N-terminal cysteine residues, by first modifying the N-terminal residue with a CPO-based reagent followed by modification of the internal cysteine with a traditional cysteine-modifying reagent. CPO-based reagents enabled a copper-free click reaction between two proteins, producing a dimer of a de novo protein mimic of IL2 that binds to the β-IL2 receptor with low nanomolar affinity. Importantly, the reagents are compatible with the common reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), a useful property for working with proteins prone to dimerization. Finally, quantum mechanical calculations uncover the origin of selectivity for CPO-based reagents for N-terminal cysteine residues.

Here, a modular, tubeless fluidic circuit board (FCB) coupled with reversibly sealed cell culture bricks for dynamic culture of embryonic stem cell-derived thyroid follicles is developed. The FCB is fabricated by milling channels in a polycarbonate (PC) plate followed by thermal bonding against another PC plate. LEGO-like fluidic interconnectors allow plug-and-play connection between a variety of cell culture bricks and the FCB. Lock-and-play clamps are integrated in the organoid brick to enable easy (un)loading of organoids. A multiplexed perfusion experiment is conducted with six FCBs, where thyroid organoids are transferred on-chip within minutes and cultured up to 10 d without losing their structure and functionality, thus validating this system as a flexible, easy-to-use platform, capable of synergistically combining organoids with advanced microfluidic platforms.",False,True,,0.63066083,modular microfluidic organoid platform using lego-like bricks,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40082352,The DNA Damage Response as an Auxiliary Indicator of Senescence in Cancer: A User-Friendly Toolkit of Markers and Detection Methods.,"Senescence is a cellular stress response causing a stable exit from the cell cycle. Limitation of cell proliferation is accompanied by a variety of characteristic changes, including cellular and nuclear morphological alterations, chromatin rearrangements, metabolic reprogramming, nuclear envelope rupture, and an immunomodulatory secretome, termed senescence-associated secreted phenotype (SASP). Senescence is a robust mechanism of tissue homeostasis, with crucial roles in eliminating dysfunctional and/or premalignant cells, and tissue repair. Activation of oncogenes triggers senescence, which in turn arrests DNA-damaged cells. This type of response, known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a powerful barrier to oncogenesis. However, in specific contexts, senescent cells support tumor progression, mainly via their secretome-mediated activities. The dynamic, context-dependent and ambivalent nature of senescence challenges the identification, characterization, and specific targeting of senescent cells for disease management. Importantly, senescence is highly intertwined with DNA damage response and repair (DDR/R) machinery that safeguards genome integrity. DNA damage events are frequently prevalent, while DDR/R signaling pathways are active during cellular senescence. In this regard, it can serve as an auxiliary indicator for senescent cells. In this chapter, we emphasize DDR/R as a shared hallmark of cancer and senescence. We provide a wieldy toolkit of experimental methods for monitoring DDR-related senescence markers, and we demonstrate the potential of using natural language processing to extract additional DDR/R biomarkers tailored to specific cancer types.

Genetically encoded biosensors have emerged as promising tools and have been used to improve microbial productivity and tolerance toward industrially relevant stresses. Here, fluorescent biosensors able to sense the yeast intracellular environment (pH, ATP levels, oxidative stress, glycolytic flux, and ribosome production) were implemented into a versatile and easy-to-use toolbox. Marker-free and efficient genome integration at a conserved site on chromosome X of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and a commercial Saccharomyces boulardii strain was developed. Moreover, multiple biosensors were used to simultaneously monitor different intracellular parameters in a single cell. Even when combined together, the biosensors did not significantly affect key physiological parameters, such as specific growth rate and product yields. Activation and response of each biosensor and their interconnection were assessed using an advanced micro-cultivation system. Finally, the toolbox was used to screen cell behavior in a synthetic lignocellulosic hydrolysate that mimicked harsh industrial substrates, revealing differences in the oxidative stress response between laboratory (CEN.PK113-7D) and industrial (Ethanol Red) S. cerevisiae strains. In summary, the toolbox will allow both the exploration of yeast diversity and physiological responses in natural and complex industrial conditions, as well as the possibility to monitor production processes.",False,True,,0.63475657,yeast intracellular state during bioprocesses,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In order to classify radiological reports properly, a high-quality annotated and curated dataset is required. Currently, no publicly available breast imaging-based radiological dataset exists for the classification of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories and breast density scores, as characterized by the American College of Radiology (ACR). To tackle this problem, we construct and annotate a breast imaging-based radiological reports dataset and its benchmark results. The dataset was originally in Spanish. Board-certified radiologists collected and annotated it according to the BI-RADS lexicon and categories at the Breast Radiology department, TecSalud Hospitals Monterrey, Mexico. Initially, it was translated into English language using Google Translate. Afterwards, it was preprocessed by removing duplicates and missing values. After preprocessing, the final dataset consists of 5046 unique reports from 5046 patients with an average age of 53 years and 100% women. Furthermore, we used word-level NLP-based embedding techniques, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and word2vec to extract semantic and syntactic information. We also compared the performance of ML, DL and large language models (LLMs) classifiers for BI-RADS category classification.<h4>Results</h4>The final breast imaging-based radiological reports dataset contains 5046 unique reports. We compared K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient-Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Biomedical Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BioGPT) classifiers. It is observed that the BioGPT classifier with preprocessed data performed 6% better with a mean sensitivity of 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.391-0.812) compared to the second best performing classifier BERT, which achieved mean sensitivity of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.477-0.607).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this work, we propose a curated and annotated benchmark dataset that can be used for BI-RADS and breast density category classification. We also provide baseline results of most ML, DL and LLMs models for BI-RADS classification that can be used as a starting point for future investigation. The main objective of this investigation is to provide a repository for the investigators who wish to enter the field to push the boundaries further.",False,True,,0.62676316,,tecrr,11.0,ok,,word2vec | transformer,biogpt,spacy,0.0,TECRR,False,0.0,True,False,,,False,,1

Both MOF-based and MOF-derived materials in powder form have been widely investigated in relation to their synthesis methods, structure and morphology controls, and performance advantages in targeted applications. However, to engage them for energy applications, both binders and additives would be required to form postprocessed electrodes, fundamentally eliminating some of the active sites and thus degrading the superior effects of the MOF-based/derived materials. The advancement of freestanding electrodes provides a new promising platform for MOF-based/derived materials in EESC thanks to their apparent merits, including fast electron/charge transmission and seamless contact between active materials and current collectors. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of freestanding structures and MOF-based/derived materials, outstanding electrochemical performance in EESC can be achieved, stimulating the increasing enthusiasm in recent years. This review provides a timely and comprehensive overview on the structural features and fabrication techniques of freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes. Then, the latest advances in freestanding MOF-based/derived electrodes are summarized from electrochemical energy storage devices to electrocatalysis.

The electroactive microorganisms (EAMs) mediate electron flows outward the cytomembrane <i>via</i> diverse pathways like multiheme cytochromes, bridging an electronic connection between abiotic and biotic reactions. On an environmental level, decades of research on EAMs and the derived subject termed ""<i>electromicrobiology</i>"" provide a rich collection of multidisciplinary knowledge and establish various bioelectrochemical designs for the development of environmental biotechnology. Recent advances suggest that EAMs actually make greater differences on a larger scale, and the metabolism of microbial community and ecological interactions between microbes play a great role in bioremediation processes. In this perspective, we propose the concept of microbial electron transfer network (METN) that demonstrates the ""species-to-species"" interactions further and discuss several key questions ranging from cellular modification to microbiome construction.

36167495,circGPA: circRNA functional annotation based on probability-generating functions.,"Recent research has already shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are functional in gene expression regulation and potentially related to diseases. Due to their stability, circRNAs can also be used as biomarkers for diagnosis. However, the function of most circRNAs remains unknown, and it is expensive and time-consuming to discover it through biological experiments. In this paper, we predict circRNA annotations from the knowledge of their interaction with miRNAs and subsequent miRNA-mRNA interactions. First, we construct an interaction network for a target circRNA and secondly spread the information from the network nodes with the known function to the root circRNA node. This idea itself is not new; our main contribution lies in proposing an efficient and exact deterministic procedure based on the principle of probability-generating functions to calculate the p-value of association test between a circRNA and an annotation term. We show that our publicly available algorithm is both more effective and efficient than the commonly used Monte-Carlo sampling approach that may suffer from difficult quantification of sampling convergence and subsequent sampling inefficiency. We experimentally demonstrate that the new approach is two orders of magnitude faster than the Monte-Carlo sampling, which makes summary annotation of large circRNA files feasible; this includes their reannotation after periodical interaction network updates, for example. We provide a summary annotation of a current circRNA database as one of our outputs.

Here, we describe a pilot study aimed at integrating public multi-meta-omics datasets from studies based on human gut and marine hatchery samples. Reference search databases (search DBs) were built using assembled metagenomic (and metatranscriptomic, where available) sequence data followed by de novo gene calling, using both data from the same sampling event and from independent samples. The resulting protein sets were evaluated for their utility in metaproteomics analysis. In agreement with previous studies, the highest number of peptide identifications was generally obtained when using search DBs created from the same samples. Data integration of the multi-omics results was performed in MGnify. For that purpose, the MGnify website was extended to enable the visualisation of the resulting peptide/protein information from three reanalysed metaproteomics datasets. A workflow (https://github.com/PRIDE-reanalysis/MetaPUF) has been developed allowing researchers to perform equivalent data integration, using paired multi-omics datasets.

However, despite being widely used, the currently available C. briggsae reference genome is substantially less complete and structurally accurate than the C. elegans reference genome. Here, we used high-coverage Oxford Nanopore long-read and chromosome-conformation capture data to generate chromosome-level reference genomes for two C. briggsae strains: QX1410, a new reference strain closely related to the laboratory AF16 strain, and VX34, a highly divergent strain isolated in China. We also sequenced 99 recombinant inbred lines generated from reciprocal crosses between QX1410 and VX34 to create a recombination map and identify chromosomal domains. Additionally, we used both short- and long-read RNA sequencing data to generate high-quality gene annotations. By comparing these new reference genomes to the current reference, we reveal that hyper-divergent haplotypes cover large portions of the C. briggsae genome, similar to recent reports in C. elegans and C. tropicalis. We also show that the genomes of selfing Caenorhabditis species have undergone more rearrangement than their outcrossing relatives, which has biased previous estimates of rearrangement rate in Caenorhabditis.

Successful use of these data-driven technologies, however, requires access to appropriate reference data. We reviewed the >373,584 reference plant DNA barcodes in public repositories and found that they cumulatively cover a remarkable quarter of the ~435,000 extant land plant species (Embryophyta). Nevertheless, coverage gaps in tropical biodiversity hotspots reflect well-documented biases in biodiversity science - most reference specimens originated in the Global North. Currently, at least 17% of plant families lack any reference barcode data whatsoever, affecting tropical and temperate regions alike. Investigators often emphasise the importance of marker choice and the need to ensure protocols are technically capable of detecting and identifying a broad range of taxa. Yet persistent geographic and taxonomic gaps in the reference datasets show that these protocols rely upon risk undermining all downstream applications of the strategy, ranging from basic biodiversity monitoring to policy-relevant objectives - such as the forensic authentication of materials in illegal trade.

At the same time, massive investments in plant genetics and genomics, led by whole genome sequencing, have led to greater knowledge of genes and genetic pathways across plant genomes. However, there remains a gap between approaches focused on forward genetics, which start with a phenotype to map a mutant locus or QTL with the goal of cloning the causal gene, and approaches using reverse genetics, which start with large-scale sequence data and work back to the gene function. The recent establishment of efficient CRISPR-Cas-based gene editing promises to bridge this gap and provide a rapid method to functionally validate genes and alleles identified through studies of natural variation. CRISPR-Cas techniques can be used to knock out single or multiple genes, precisely modify genes through base and prime editing, and replace alleles.

40134047,A 3D Genome Atlas of Genetic Variants and Their Pathological Effects in Cancer.,"The hierarchical organization of the eukaryotic genome is crucial for nuclear activities and cellular development. Genetic aberrations can disrupt this 3D genomic architecture, potentially driving oncogenesis. However, current research often lacks a comprehensive perspective, focusing on specific mutation types and singular 3D structural levels. Here, pathological changes from chromosomes to nucleotides are systematically cataloged, including 10 789 interchromosomal translocations (ICTs), 18 863 structural variants (SVs), and 162 769 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The multilayered analysis reveals that fewer than 10% of ICTs disrupt territories via potent 3D interactions, and only a minimal fraction of SVs disrupt compartments or intersect topologically associated domain structures, yet these events significantly influence gene expression. Pathogenic SNPs typically show reduced interactions within the 3D genomic space. To investigate the effects of variants in the context of 3D organization, a two-phase scoring algorithm, 3DFunc, is developed to evaluate the pathogenicity of variant-gene pairs in cancer. Using 3DFunc, IGHV3-23's critical role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is identified and it is found that three pathological SNPs (rs6605578, rs7814783, rs2738144) interact with DEFA3.

40036254,MAF: An algorithm based on multi-agent characteristics for infrared and visible video fusion.,"Addressing the limitation of existing infrared and visible video fusion models, which fail to dynamically adjust fusion strategies based on video differences, often resulting in suboptimal or failed outcomes, we propose an infrared and visible video fusion algorithm that leverages the autonomous and flexible characteristics of multi-agent systems. First, we analyze the functional architecture of agents and the inherent properties of multi-agent systems to construct a multi-agent fusion model and corresponding fusion agents. Next, we identify regions of interest in each frame of the video sequence, focusing on frames that exhibit significant changes. The multi-agent fusion model then perceives the key distinguishing features between the images to be fused, deploys the appropriate fusion agents, and employs the effectiveness of fusion to infer and determine the fusion algorithms, rules, and parameters, ultimately selecting the optimal fusion strategy. Finally, in the context of a complex fusion process, the multi-agent fusion model performs the fusion task through the collaborative interaction of multiple fusion agents. This approach establishes a multi-layered, dynamically adaptable fusion model, enabling real-time adjustments to the fusion algorithm during the infrared and visible video fusion process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in preserving key targets in infrared videos and structural details in visible videos.

35792866,Biological Misinterpretation of Transcriptional Signatures in Tumor Samples Can Unknowingly Undermine Mechanistic Understanding and Faithful Alignment with Preclinical Data.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Precise mechanism-based gene expression signatures (GES) have been developed in appropriate in vitro and in vivo model systems, to identify important cancer-related signaling processes. However, some GESs originally developed to represent specific disease processes, primarily with an epithelial cell focus, are being applied to heterogeneous tumor samples where the expression of the genes in the signature may no longer be epithelial-specific. Therefore, unknowingly, even small changes in tumor stroma percentage can directly influence GESs, undermining the intended mechanistic signaling.<h4>Experimental design</h4>Using colorectal cancer as an exemplar, we deployed numerous orthogonal profiling methodologies, including laser capture microdissection, flow cytometry, bulk and multiregional biopsy clinical samples, single-cell RNA sequencing and finally spatial transcriptomics, to perform a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the most widely used GESs to be influenced, or confounded, by stromal content in tumor tissue. To complement this work, we generated a freely-available resource, ConfoundR; https://confoundr.qub.ac.uk/, that enables users to test the extent of stromal influence on an unlimited number of the genes/signatures simultaneously across colorectal, breast, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer datasets.<h4>Results</h4>Findings presented here demonstrate the clear potential for misinterpretation of the meaning of GESs, due to widespread stromal influences, which in-turn can undermine faithful alignment between clinical samples and preclinical data/models, particularly cell lines and organoids, or tumor models not fully recapitulating the stromal and immune microenvironment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Efforts to faithfully align preclinical models of disease using phenotypically-designed GESs must ensure that the signatures themselves remain representative of the same biology when applied to clinical samples.",False,True,,0.643561,biological misinterpretation of transcriptional signatures in tumor samples can unknowingly undermine mechanistic understanding and faithful alignment with preclinical data,,11.0,ok,,confoundr,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,https://confoundr.qub.ac.uk/,https://confoundr.qub.ac.uk/,True,"...generated a freely-available resource, ConfoundR; https://confoundr.qub.ac.uk/, that enables users to test the extent of stromal...",1
39823405,Pooled PPIseq: Screening the SARS-CoV-2 and human interface with a scalable multiplexed protein-protein interaction assay platform.,"Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are a key interface between virus and host, and these interactions are important to both viral reprogramming of the host and to host restriction of viral infection. In particular, viral-host PPI networks can be used to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tissue specificity, host range, and virulence. At higher scales, viral-host PPI screening could also be used to screen for small-molecule antivirals that interfere with essential viral-host interactions, or to explore how the PPI networks between interacting viral and host genomes co-evolve. Current high-throughput PPI assays have screened entire viral-host PPI networks. However, these studies are time consuming, often require specialized equipment, and are difficult to further scale. Here, we develop methods that make larger-scale viral-host PPI screening more accessible. This approach combines the mDHFR split-tag reporter with the iSeq2 interaction-barcoding system to permit massively-multiplexed PPI quantification by simple pooled engineering of barcoded constructs, integration of these constructs into budding yeast, and fitness measurements by pooled cell competitions and barcode-sequencing. We applied this method to screen for PPIs between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, screening in triplicate >180,000 ORF-ORF combinations represented by >1,000,000 barcoded lineages. Our results complement previous screens by identifying 74 putative PPIs, including interactions between ORF7A with the taste receptors TAS2R41 and TAS2R7, and between NSP4 with the transmembrane KDELR2 and KDELR3.

This is limiting the view to the pathological manifestations, while it neglects mechanistic relationships that are crucial to develop therapeutic strategies. This work aims to advance the understanding of diseases and their relatedness beyond traditional phenotypic views. Hence, the similarity among 502 diseases is mapped using six different data dimensions encompassing molecular, clinical, and pharmacological information retrieved from public sources. Multiple distance measures and multi-view clustering are used to assess the patterns of disease relatedness. The integration of all six dimensions into a consensus map of disease relationships reveals a divergent disease view from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), emphasizing novel insights offered by a multi-view disease map. Disease features such as genes, pathways, and chemicals that are enriched in distinct disease groups are identified. Finally, an evaluation of the top similar diseases of three candidate diseases common in the Western population shows concordance with known epidemiological associations and reveals rare features shared between Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease.

The emerging sources of cancer-related spatiotemporal environmental data and residential history information, coupled with novel technologies for data extraction and linkage, present an opportunity to integrate these data into the existing cancer surveillance data infrastructure, thereby facilitating more comprehensive assessment of cancer risk and outcomes. In this paper, we performed a landscape analysis of the available environmental data sources that could be linked to historical residential address information of cancer patients' records collected by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. The objective is to enable researchers to use these data to assess potential exposures at the time of cancer initiation through the time of diagnosis and even after diagnosis. The paper addresses the challenges associated with data collection and completeness at various spatial and temporal scales, as well as opportunities and directions for future research.",False,True,,0.6547336,,seer,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
35531270,Structure-Activity Predictions From Computational Mining of Protein Databases to Assist Modular Design of Antimicrobial Peptides.,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally produced by pro- and eukaryotes and are promising alternatives to antibiotics to fight multidrug-resistant microorganisms. However, despite thousands of AMP entries in respective databases, predictions about their structure-activity relationships are still limited. Similarly, common or dissimilar properties of AMPs that have evolved in different taxonomic groups are nearly unknown. We leveraged data entries for 10,987 peptides currently listed in the three antimicrobial peptide databases APD, DRAMP and DBAASP to aid structure-activity predictions. However, this number reduced to 3,828 AMPs that we could use for computational analyses, due to our stringent quality control criteria. The analysis uncovered a strong bias towards AMPs isolated from amphibians (1,391), whereas only 35 AMPs originate from fungi (0.9%), hindering evolutionary analyses on the origin and phylogenetic relationship of AMPs. The majority (62%) of the 3,828 AMPs consists of less than 40 amino acids but with a molecular weight higher than 2.5 kDa, has a net positive charge and shares a hydrophobic character. They are enriched in glycine, lysine and cysteine but are depleted in glutamate, aspartate and methionine when compared with a peptide set of the same size randomly selected from the UniProt database. The AMPs that deviate from this pattern (38%) can be found in different taxonomic groups, in particular in Gram-negative bacteria. Remarkably, the γ-core motif claimed so far as a unifying structural signature in cysteine-stabilised AMPs is absent in nearly 90% of the peptides, questioning its relevance as a prerequisite for antimicrobial activity. The disclosure of AMPs pattern and their variation in producing organism groups extends our knowledge of the structural diversity of AMPs and will assist future peptide screens in unexplored microorganisms. Structural design of peptide antibiotic drugs will benefit using natural AMPs as lead compounds. However, a reliable and statistically balanced database is missing which leads to a large knowledge gap in the AMP field. Thus, thorough evaluation of the available data, mitigation of biases and standardised experimental setups need to be implemented to leverage the full potential of AMPs for drug development programmes in the clinics and agriculture.",False,True,,0.67021513,structure-activity predictions from computational mining of protein databases to assist modular design of antimicrobial peptides,,11.0,ok,,uniprot,dramp | dbaasp,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In so doing, we argue that CA and MCA address recent concerns about psychological methods and approaches. After summarizing how categories are typically theorized and studied, we describe the main features of a CA approach to categories, including how this differs from conventional psychology. We review the core domains of research in CA and how categories can be studied systematically in relation to the basic machinery of talk and other conduct in interaction.

As part of an ongoing global effort to establish new brain banks providing both high-quality neuroimaging scans and detailed histopathology examinations, the South Texas Alzheimer's Disease Re- search Center postmortem repository was recently created with the specific purpose of studying comorbid dementias. As the repository is reaching a milestone of two hundred brain donations and a hundred curated MRI sessions are ready for processing, robust statistical analyses can now be conducted. In this work, we report the very first morphometry analysis conducted with this new data set. We describe the processing pipelines that were specifically developed to exploit the available MRI sequences, and we explain how we addressed several postmortem neuroimaging challenges, such as the separation of brain tissues from fixative fluids, the need for updated brain atlases, and the tissue contrast changes induced by brain fixation. In general, our results establish that a combination of structural MRI sequences can provide enough informa- tion for state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms to almost perfectly separate brain tissues from a formalin buffered solution. Regional brain volumes are challenging to measure in postmortem scans, but robust estimates sensitive to sex differences and age trends, reflecting clinical diagnosis, neuropathology findings, and the shrinkage induced by tissue fixation can be obtained.

The concept big data represents not only a technology but also a resource and a method. Big data are regarded as an important strategic resource both at the national level and at the medical institutional level, thus great importance has been attached to the construction of a big data platform for health care.<h4>Objective</h4>We aimed to develop and implement a big data platform for a large hospital, to overcome difficulties in integrating, calculating, storing, and governing multisource heterogeneous data in a standardized way, as well as to ensure health care data security.<h4>Methods</h4>The project to build a big data platform at West China Hospital of Sichuan University was launched in 2017. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform has extracted, integrated, and governed data from different departments and sections of the hospital since January 2008. A master-slave mode was implemented to realize the real-time integration of multisource heterogeneous massive data, and an environment that separates heterogeneous characteristic data storage and calculation processes was built. A business-based metadata model was improved for data quality control, and a standardized health care data governance system and scientific closed-loop data security ecology were established.<h4>Results</h4>After 3 years of design, development, and testing, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform was formally brought online in November 2020. It has formed a massive multidimensional data resource database, with more than 12.49 million patients, 75.67 million visits, and 8475 data variables. Along with hospital operations data, newly generated data are entered into the platform in real time. Since its launch, the platform has supported more than 20 major projects and provided data service, storage, and computing power support to many scientific teams, facilitating a shift in the data support model-from conventional manual extraction to self-service retrieval (which has reached 8561 retrievals per month).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The platform can combine operation systems data from all departments and sections in a hospital to form a massive high-dimensional high-quality health care database that allows electronic medical records to be used effectively and taps into the value of data to fully support clinical services, scientific research, and operations management. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform can successfully generate multisource heterogeneous data storage and computing power. By effectively governing massive multidimensional data gathered from multiple sources, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform provides highly available data assets and thus has a high application value in the health care field.

35319171,Towards Mapping Mouse Metabolic Tissue Atlas by Mid-Infrared Imaging with Heavy Water Labeling.,"Understanding metabolism is of great significance to decipher various physiological and pathogenic processes. While great progress has been made to profile gene expression, how to capture organ-, tissue-, and cell-type-specific metabolic profile (i.e., metabolic tissue atlas) in complex mammalian systems is lagging behind, largely owing to the lack of metabolic imaging tools with high resolution and high throughput. Here, the authors applied mid-infrared imaging coupled with heavy water (D<sub>2</sub> O) metabolic labeling to a scope of mouse organs and tissues. The premise is that, as D<sub>2</sub> O participates in the biosynthesis of various macromolecules, the resulting broad C-D vibrational spectrum should interrogate a wide range of metabolic pathways. Applying multivariate analysis to the C-D spectrum, the authors successfully identified both inter-organ and intra-tissue metabolic signatures of mice. A large-scale metabolic atlas map between different organs from the same mice is thus generated. Moreover, leveraging the power of unsupervised clustering methods, spatially-resolved metabolic signatures of brain tissues are discovered, revealing tissue and cell-type specific metabolic profile in situ. As a demonstration of this technique, the authors captured metabolic changes during brain development and characterized intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity of glioblastoma.

35417484,Happy work: Improving enterprise human resource management by predicting workers' stress using deep learning.,"Recently, workers in most enterprises suffer from excessive occupational stress in the workplace, which negatively affects workers' productivity, safety, and health. To deal with stress in workers, it is vital for the human resource management (HRM) department to manage stress effectively, bridging the gap between management and stressed employees. To manage stress effectively, the first step is to predict workers' stress and detect the factors causing stress among workers. Existing methods often rely on the stress assessment questionnaire, which may not be effective to predict workers' stress, due to 1) the difficulty of collecting the questionnaire data, and 2) the bias brought by workers' subjectivity when completing the questionnaires. In this paper, we aim to address this issue and accurately predict workers' stress status based on Deep Learning (DL) approach.

During the growth of medicinal plants, various adversities can lead to nutrient loss and yield decline. Using traditional chemical pesticides to control the stress resistance of plants will cause serious pollution to the environment and even endanger human health. Therefore, it is necessary to find suitable pesticide substitutes from natural ingredients. As an important part of the microecology of medicinal plants, endophytes can promote the growth of medicinal plants, improve the stress tolerance of hosts, and promote the accumulation of active components of hosts. Endophytes have a more positive and direct impact on the host and can metabolize rich medicinal ingredients, so researchers pay attention to them.

35893052,A Primer Genetic Toolkit for Exploring Mitochondrial Biology and Disease Using Zebrafish.,"Mitochondria are a dynamic eukaryotic innovation that play diverse roles in biology and disease. The mitochondrial genome is remarkably conserved in all vertebrates, encoding the same 37-gene set and overall genomic structure, ranging from 16,596 base pairs (bp) in the teleost zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) to 16,569 bp in humans. Mitochondrial disorders are amongst the most prevalent inherited diseases, affecting roughly 1 in every 5000 individuals. Currently, few effective treatments exist for those with mitochondrial ailments, representing a major unmet patient need. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a common component of a wide variety of other human illnesses, ranging from neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease to autoimmune illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The electron transport chain (ETC) component of mitochondria is critical for mitochondrial biology and defects can lead to many mitochondrial disease symptoms. Here, we present a publicly available collection of genetic mutants created in highly conserved, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in <i>Danio rerio</i>. The zebrafish system represents a potentially powerful new opportunity for the study of mitochondrial biology and disease due to the large number of orthologous genes shared with humans and the many advanced features of this model system, from genetics to imaging. This collection includes 15 mutant lines in 13 different genes created through locus-specific gene editing to induce frameshift or splice acceptor mutations, leading to predicted protein truncation during translation. Additionally, included are 11 lines created by the random insertion of the gene-breaking transposon (GBT) protein trap cassette. All these targeted mutant alleles truncate conserved domains of genes critical to the proper function of the ETC or genes that have been implicated in human mitochondrial disease.

38236062,Cancer Mutations Converge on a Collection of Protein Assemblies to Predict Resistance to Replication Stress.,"Rapid proliferation is a hallmark of cancer associated with sensitivity to therapeutics that cause DNA replication stress (RS). Many tumors exhibit drug resistance, however, via molecular pathways that are incompletely understood. Here, we develop an ensemble of predictive models that elucidate how cancer mutations impact the response to common RS-inducing (RSi) agents. The models implement recent advances in deep learning to facilitate multidrug prediction and mechanistic interpretation. Initial studies in tumor cells identify 41 molecular assemblies that integrate alterations in hundreds of genes for accurate drug response prediction. These cover roles in transcription, repair, cell-cycle checkpoints, and growth signaling, of which 30 are shown by loss-of-function genetic screens to regulate drug sensitivity or replication restart. The model translates to cisplatin-treated cervical cancer patients, highlighting an RTK-JAK-STAT assembly governing resistance. This study defines a compendium of mechanisms by which mutations affect therapeutic responses, with implications for precision medicine.<h4>Significance</h4>Zhao and colleagues use recent advances in machine learning to study the effects of tumor mutations on the response to common therapeutics that cause RS. The resulting predictive models integrate numerous genetic alterations distributed across a constellation of molecular assemblies, facilitating a quantitative and interpretable assessment of drug response.

40382431,Semi-automated annotation for video-based beef cattle behavior recognition.,"In this paper, a video-based behavioural recognition dataset for beef cattle is constructed. The dataset covers five behaviours of beef cattle: standing, lying, drinking, feeding, and ruminating. Six beef cows in a captive barn were selected and monitored for 168 h. Different light conditions and nighttime data were considered. The dataset was collected by one surveillance video camera. The data collection process required deploying cameras, memory, routers and laptops. Data annotation was automated using the YOLOv8 target detection model and the ByteTrack multi-target tracking algorithm to annotate each beef cow's coordinates and identity codes. The FFmpeg tool cut out individual beef cow video clips and manually annotated them with behavioural labels. The dataset includes 500 video clips, 2000 image recognition samples, over 4000 target tracking samples, and over 10G of frame sequence images. 4974 video data of different behavioural types are labelled, totalling about 14 h. Based on this, a TimeSformer multi-behaviour recognition model for beef cattle based on video understanding is proposed as a baseline evaluation model. The experimental results show that the model can effectively learn the corresponding category labels from the behavioural category data of the dataset, with an average recognition accuracy of 90.33% on the test set. In addition, a data enhancement and oversampling strategy was adopted to solve the data imbalance problem and reduce the risk of model overfitting.

To address these challenges and efficiently normalize and filter out noisy data, an automated processing approach integrating the stepwise technique, mode, and percentile gate bands for both single and peer group-based holes was developed. Subsequently, the mathematical concept of a novel normalizing index for classifying such big datasets was also presented. The visualized results from different geo-infrastructure datasets in Sweden indicated that outliers and noisy data can more efficiently be eliminated using single hole-based normalizing. Additionally, a relational unified PostgreSQL database was created to store and automatically transfer the processed and raw MWD as well as real time grouting data that offers a cost effective and efficient data extraction tool.

These <b><i>textile anatomies</i></b> make the identification, separation, sorting, and recycling of post-consumer textiles, especially, difficult. While textile anatomy data is often retrievable for pre- and post-industrial textiles (off-cuts or rejects from manufacturing), it is often difficult to retrieve for textiles which have reached the consumer. The lack of data available on the textile anatomies of pre- and post-consumer textile waste skews predictions and market forecasts for the expected yields, capacities, and qualities of post-consumer textile sorting and recycling activities. This disrupts planning for sorting, removal of findings, and scaling of recycling technologies. To better plan for the innovation needs, market capacity, and policy levers needed to improve the efficiency of sorting and recycling activities, there is an urgent need for data on the unique anatomies of pre- and post-consumer textiles. This is especially important as the EU mandates that all member states must separately collect and treat post-consumer textiles beginning in 2025. Therefore, this database contains two datasets offering textile anatomies for more than 5000 separate garment samples from the post-industrial-pre consumer retail mass market (RMM) and the Post-Consumer Textile Waste Market (PCTWM). This database contains crucial data on each garment's fibre composition, finding presence, and layer presence. The two datasets are the results of two separate waste composition campaigns conducted in the Nordic Region in 2022: One focused on the textile anatomies of the RMM (4,495 samples) and the other on the PCTWM (1,248 samples). The RMM data was collected by sampling garments across mass market retailers in the Copenhagen municipality of DK during the spring/summer seasons of 2022. The PCTWM data was collected by sampling post-consumer textile waste bales from pre- and post-sorting lines at the SIPTEX sorting facility in Malmo, SE in the winter of 2022. In both datasets, surveys deployed via webapp were utilized to streamline sampling and ensure consistent recording of the fibre blends, number of findings present, and layers present. In the PCTWM dataset additional data is provided on the fibre composition of layers, as well as the placement and type of findings present. Each dataset in this database can be used by industrial ecologists, economists, and textile engineers to better forecast, map, and analyse the potential treatment of expected post-consumer textiles. Moreover, the methodology and approach to data gathering can be used as a blueprint for future regionalized databases throughout the European Union.

For this reason, the continued development of genome quality metrics is imperative. Using the 2016 Atlantic bottlenose dolphin NCBI RefSeq annotation and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of six tissues, we confirmed 10,402 proteins from 4711 protein groups, constituting nearly one-third of the possible predicted proteins. Since the identification of larger proteins with more identified peptides implies reduced database fragmentation and improved gene annotation accuracy, we propose the metric NP<sub>10</sub>, which attempts to capture this quality improvement. The NP<sub>10</sub> metric is calculated by first stratifying proteomic results by identifying the top decile (or 10th 10-quantile) of identified proteins based on the number of peptides per protein and then returns the median molecular weight of the resulting proteins. When using the 2016 versus 2012 <i>Tursiops truncatus</i> genome annotation to search this proteomic data set, there was a 21% improvement in NP<sub>10</sub>. This metric was further demonstrated by using a publicly available proteomic data set to compare human genome annotations from 2004, 2013 and 2016, which showed a 33% improvement in NP<sub>10</sub>. These results demonstrate that proteomics may be a useful metrological tool to benchmark genome accuracy, though there is a need for reference proteomic datasets across species to facilitate the evaluation of new de novo and existing genome.",False,True,,0.649519,tool to evaluate genome annotation accuracy following de novo genome assembly,,11.0,ok,,,refseq,spacy,0.0,Proteomics as a Metrological Tool to Evaluate Genome Annotation Accuracy Following De Novo Genome Assembly,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

The disease quickly spread worldwide, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic in March 2020.From the first notifications of spread of the disease, the WHO's Emergency Programme implemented a global COVID-19 surveillance system in coordination with all WHO regional offices. The system aimed to monitor the spread of the epidemic over countries and across population groups, severity of the disease and risk factors, and the impact of control measures. COVID-19 surveillance data reported to WHO is a combination of case-based data and weekly aggregated data, focusing on a minimum global dataset for cases and deaths including disaggregation by age, sex, occupation as a Health Care Worker, as well as number of cases tested, and number of cases newly admitted for hospitalization. These disaggregations aim to monitor inequities in COVID-19 distribution and risk factors among population groups.SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves continue to sweep the world; as of March 2022, over 445 million cases and 6 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Of these, over 327 million cases (74%) have been reported in the WHO surveillance database, of which 255 million cases (57%) are disaggregated by age and sex.

However, most of the wheat-growing areas experience several biotic and abiotic stresses, resulting in poor quality grains and reduced yield. To ensure food security for the growing population in India, there is a compelling need to explore the untapped genetic diversity available in gene banks for the development of stress-resistant/tolerant cultivars. The improvement of any crop lies in exploring and harnessing the genetic diversity available in its genetic resources in the form of cultivated varieties, landraces, wild relatives, and related genera. A huge collection of wheat genetic resources is conserved in various gene banks across the globe. Molecular and phenotypic characterization followed by documentation of conserved genetic resources is a prerequisite for germplasm utilization in crop improvement. The National Genebank of India has an extensive and diverse collection of wheat germplasm, comprising Indian wheat landraces, primitive cultivars, breeding lines, and collection from other countries. The conserved germplasm can contribute immensely to the development of wheat cultivars with high levels of biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Breeding wheat varieties that can give high yields under different stress environments has not made much headway due to high genotypes and environmental interaction, non-availability of truly resistant/tolerant germplasm, and non-availability of reliable markers linked with the QTL having a significant impact on resistance/tolerance. The development of new breeding technologies like genomic selection (GS), which takes into account the G × E interaction, will facilitate crop improvement through enhanced climate resilience, by combining biotic and abiotic stress resistance/tolerance and maximizing yield potential.

When designing ALD precursors, it is important to consider the melting point, because the precursors should have melting points lower than the process temperature. However, obtaining melting point data is challenging due to experimental sensitivity and high computational costs. As a result, a comprehensive and well-organized database for the melting point of the OMCs has not been fully reported yet. Therefore, in this study, we constructed a database of melting points for 1,845 OMCs, including 58 metal and 6 metalloid elements. The database contains CAS numbers, molecular formulas, and structural information and was constructed through automatic extraction and systematic curation. The melting point information was extracted using two methods: 1) 1,434 materials from 11 chemical vendor databases and 2) 411 materials identified through natural language processing (NLP) techniques with an accuracy of 86.3%, based on 2,096 scientific papers published over the past 29 years. In our database, the OMCs contain up to around 250 atoms and have melting points that range from -170 to 1610 °C. The main source is the Chemsrc database, accounting for 607 materials (32.9%), and Fe is the most common central metal or metalloid element (15.0%), followed by Si (11.6%) and B (6.7%). To validate the utilization of the constructed database, a multimodal neural network model was developed integrating graph-based and feature-based information as descriptors to predict the melting points of the OMCs but moderate performance.

They act as semi-permeable boundaries that define cells and organelles. In addition, their surfaces actively participate in biochemical reaction networks, where they confine proteins, align reaction partners, and directly control enzymatic activities. Membrane-localized reactions shape cellular membranes, define the identity of organelles, compartmentalize biochemical processes, and can even be the source of signaling gradients that originate at the plasma membrane and reach into the cytoplasm and nucleus. The membrane surface is, therefore, an essential platform upon which myriad cellular processes are scaffolded. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the biophysics and biochemistry of membrane-localized reactions with particular focus on insights derived from reconstituted and cellular systems.

38074791,Bayesian Networks in Radiology.,"A Bayesian network is a graphical model that uses probability theory to represent relationships among its variables. The model is a directed acyclic graph whose nodes represent variables, such as the presence of a disease or an imaging finding. Connections between nodes express causal influences between variables as probability values. Bayesian networks can learn their structure (nodes and connections) and/or conditional probability values from data. Bayesian networks offer several advantages: <i>(a)</i> they can efficiently perform complex inferences, <i>(b)</i> reason from cause to effect or vice versa, <i>(c)</i> assess counterfactual data, <i>(d)</i> integrate observations with canonical (""textbook"") knowledge, and <i>(e)</i> explain their reasoning. Bayesian networks have been employed in a wide variety of applications in radiology, including diagnosis and treatment planning. Unlike deep learning approaches, Bayesian networks have not been applied to computer vision. However, hybrid artificial intelligence systems have combined deep learning models with Bayesian networks, where the deep learning model identifies findings in medical images and the Bayesian network formulates and explains a diagnosis from those findings. One can apply a Bayesian network's probabilistic knowledge to integrate clinical and imaging findings to support diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical decision-making.

Peptides are considered potent recombinant protein alternatives due to their specificity, high stability, low production cost, and ability to be easily tailored and immobilized. Stem cell proliferation and differentiation processes are orchestrated by an intricate interaction between numerous growth factors and proteins and their target receptors and ligands. Various growth factors, functional proteins, and cellular matrix-derived peptides efficiently enhance stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and directed differentiation. For that, peptides can be immobilized on a culture plate or conjugated to scaffolds, such as hydrogels or synthetic matrices.

The carbon footprint (CF), derived from the concept of ecological footprint, has been used to assess the threat of climate change in recent years. As a ""top to bottom"" method, input-output analysis (IOA) has become a universally applicable CF assessment tool for tracing the carbon footprint embodied in economic activities. A wide range of CF studies from the perspective of the IOA model have been presented and have made great progress. It is crucial to have a better understanding of what the relevant research focuses on in this field, yet so far a systematic synopsis of the literature is missing. The purpose of this paper is to explore the knowledge structure and frontier trends in respect of the IOA model applied to CF research using scientometric visualization analysis. The main findings of this paper are as follows. (1) Published articles show a two-stage increase in the period 2008 to 2021, and present a complex academic network of countries, authors, and institutions in this important domain. (2) The classic studies are mainly divided into three categories: literature reviews, database application introduction, and CF accounting in different scales.

36059758,Semantic Representation of Context for Description of Named Rivers in a Terminological Knowledge Base.,"The description of named entities in terminological knowledge bases has never been addressed in any depth in terminology. Firm preconceptions, rooted in philosophy, about the only referential function of proper names have presumably led to disparage their inclusion in terminology resources, despite the relevance of named entities having been highlighted by prominent figures in the discipline of terminology. Scholars from different branches of linguistics depart from the conservative stance on proper names and have foregrounded the need for a novel approach, more linguistic than philosophical, to describing proper names. Therefore, this paper proposed a linguistic and terminological approach to the study of named entities when used in scientific discourse, with the purpose of representing them in EcoLexicon, an environmental knowledge base designed according to the premises of Frame-based Terminology. We focused more specifically on named rivers (or potamonyms) mentioned in a coastal engineering corpus. Inclusion of named entities in terminological knowledge bases requires analyzing the context that surrounds them in specialized texts because these contexts convey specialized knowledge about named entities. For the semantic representation of context, this paper thus analyzed the local syntactic and semantic contexts that surrounded potamonyms in coastal engineering texts and described the semantic annotation of the predicate-argument structure of sentences where a potamonym was mentioned. The semantic variables annotated were the following: (1) semantic category of the arguments; (2) semantic role of the arguments; (3) semantic relation between the arguments; and (4) lexical domain of the verbs. This method yielded valuable insight into the different semantic roles that named rivers played, the entities and processes that participated in the events educed by potamonyms through verbs, and how they all interacted. Furthermore, since arguments are specialized terms and verbs are relational constructs, the analysis of argument structure led to the construction of semantic networks that depicted specialized knowledge about named rivers. These conceptual networks were then used to craft the thematic description of potamonyms. Accordingly, the semantic network and the thematic description not only constituted the representation of a potamonym in EcoLexicon, but also allowed the geographic contextualization of specialized concepts in the terminological resource.",False,True,,0.65555966,semantic representation of context for description of named rivers,,11.0,ok,,ecolexicon,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

37010293,Comprehensive Functional Annotation of Metagenomes and Microbial Genomes Using a Deep Learning-Based Method.,"Comprehensive protein function annotation is essential for understanding microbiome-related disease mechanisms in the host organisms. However, a large portion of human gut microbial proteins lack functional annotation. Here, we have developed a new metagenome analysis workflow integrating <i>de novo</i> genome reconstruction, taxonomic profiling, and deep learning-based functional annotations from DeepFRI. This is the first approach to apply deep learning-based functional annotations in metagenomics. We validate DeepFRI functional annotations by comparing them to orthology-based annotations from eggNOG on a set of 1,070 infant metagenomes from the DIABIMMUNE cohort. Using this workflow, we generated a sequence catalogue of 1.9 million nonredundant microbial genes. The functional annotations revealed 70% concordance between Gene Ontology annotations predicted by DeepFRI and eggNOG. DeepFRI improved the annotation coverage, with 99% of the gene catalogue obtaining Gene Ontology molecular function annotations, although they are less specific than those from eggNOG. Additionally, we constructed pangenomes in a reference-free manner using high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and analyzed the associated annotations. eggNOG annotated more genes on well-studied organisms, such as Escherichia coli, while DeepFRI was less sensitive to taxa. Further, we show that DeepFRI provides additional annotations in comparison to the previous DIABIMMUNE studies. This workflow will contribute to novel understanding of the functional signature of the human gut microbiome in health and disease as well as guiding future metagenomics studies. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The past decade has seen advancement in high-throughput sequencing technologies resulting in rapid accumulation of genomic data from microbial communities. While this growth in sequence data and gene discovery is impressive, the majority of microbial gene functions remain uncharacterized. The coverage of functional information coming from either experimental sources or inferences is low. To solve these challenges, we have developed a new workflow to computationally assemble microbial genomes and annotate the genes using a deep learning-based model DeepFRI. This improved microbial gene annotation coverage to 1.9 million metagenome-assembled genes, representing 99% of the assembled genes, which is a significant improvement compared to 12% Gene Ontology term annotation coverage by commonly used orthology-based approaches. Importantly, the workflow supports pangenome reconstruction in a reference-free manner, allowing us to analyze the functional potential of individual bacterial species. We therefore propose this alternative approach combining deep-learning functional predictions with the commonly used orthology-based annotations as one that could help us uncover novel functions observed in metagenomic microbiome studies.",False,True,,0.69951093,functional annotation of metagenomes and microbial genomes,,11.0,ok,,deepfri,eggnog,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

A bioinformatics-based approach to predict and derisk a drug development program can save time, effort, and expenses resulting from failure of experimental anticancer agents in preclinical/early clinical stages. We present a two-step in silico ensemble method, involving the comparison of localized gene expression from surrounding tissue with tumor tissue, and subsequent correlation with patient survival data, which can help predict safety and efficacy for siRNA-based drug delivery to internal cancer tissues. This is achieved by reducing the possible off-target effects due to reduced or minimal expression of the drug target in surrounding tissue, and increasing survival probability for patients whose cancers can be controlled/eliminated by siRNA-mediated inhibition of drug target.

Leaves are composed of interconnected functional elements that evolved in concert under high selective pressure, directed toward strategies for improving productivity with limited resources. In this paper, selected basic components of the leaf are described together with biomimetic examples derived from them. The epidermis (the ""skin"" of leaves) protects the leaf from uncontrolled desiccation and carries functional surface structures such as wax crystals and hairs. The epidermis is pierced by micropore apparatuses, stomata, which allow for regulated gas exchange. Photosynthesis takes place in the internal leaf tissue, while the venation system supplies the leaf with water and nutrients and exports the products of photosynthesis. Identifying the selective forces as well as functional limitations of the single components requires understanding the leaf as an integrated system that was shaped by evolution to maximize carbon gain from limited resource availability. These economic aspects of leaf function manifest themselves as trade-off solutions.

36355441,Negatively Competitive Incoherent Feedforward Loops Mitigate Winner-Take-All Resource Competition.,"The effects of host resource limitations on the function of synthetic gene circuits have gained significant attention over the past years. Hosts, having evolved resource capacities optimal for their own genome, have been repeatedly demonstrated to suffer from the added burden of synthetic genetic programs, which may in return pose deleterious effects on the circuit's function. Three resource controller archetypes have been proposed previously to mitigate resource distribution problems in dynamic circuits: the local controller, the global controller, and a ""negatively competitive"" regulatory (NCR) controller that utilizes synthetic competition to combat resource competition. The dynamics of negative feedback forms of these controllers have been previously investigated, and here we extend the analysis of these resource allocation strategies to the incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL) topology. We demonstrate that the three iFFL controllers can attenuate Winner-Take-All resource competition between two bistable switches. We uncover that the parameters associated with the synthetic competition in the NCR iFFL controller are paramount to its increased efficacy over the local controller type, while the global controllers demonstrate to be relatively ineffectual. Interestingly, unlike the negative feedback counterpart topologies, iFFL controllers exhibit a unique coupling of switch activation thresholds which we term the ""coactivation threshold shift"" effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a nearly fully orthogonal set of bistable switches could be achieved by pairing an NCR controller with an appropriate level of controller resource consumption.",False,True,,0.66565454,negatively competitive incoherent feedforward loops mitigate winner-take-all resource competition,,11.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Public generosity bestows an abundance of resources for the study of extremely rare diseases; this unique dynamic creates a research environment in which problems with high-dimension and low sample size are commonplace.

The genomic random interval (GRIN) method evaluates the loci and frequency of genomic abnormalities in the DNA of tumors to identify genes that may drive the development of malignancies. The association of lesions with expression (ALEX) method evaluates the impact of genomic abnormalities on the RNA transcription of nearby genes to inform the formulation of biological hypotheses on molecular mechanisms. The projection onto the most interesting statistical evidence (PROMISE) method identifies omic features that consistently associate with better prognosis or consistently associate with worse prognosis across multiple measures of clinical outcome. We have shown that these methods are statistically robust and powerful in the statistical bioinformatic literature and successfully used these methods to make fundamental biological discoveries that have formed the scientific rationale for ongoing clinical trials.

Together with its sister-species G. arboreum, these A-genome taxa represent models of the extinct A-genome donor of modern polyploid cotton, which provide about 95% of cotton grown worldwide. As part of a larger effort to characterize variation and improve resources among diverse diploid and polyploid cotton genomes, we sequenced and assembled the genome of G. herbaceum cultivar (cv.) Wagad, representing the first domesticated accession for this species. This chromosome-level genome was generated using a combination of PacBio long-read technology, HiC, and Bionano optical mapping and compared to existing genome sequences in cotton.

37191528,"Cross-Platform Transcriptomic Data Integration, Profiling, and Mining in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>.","A large number of transcriptome studies generate important data and information for the study of pathogenic mechanisms of pathogens, including Vibrio cholerae. V. cholerae transcriptome data include RNA-seq and microarray: microarray data mainly include clinical human and environmental samples, and RNA-seq data mainly focus on laboratory processing conditions, including different stresses and experimental animals <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, we integrated the data sets of both platforms using Rank-in and the Limma R package normalized Between Arrays function, achieving the first cross-platform transcriptome data integration of V. cholerae. By integrating the entire transcriptome data, we obtained the profiles of the most active or silent genes. By transferring the integrated expression profiles into the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) pipeline, we identified the important functional modules of V. cholerae <i>in vitro</i> stress treatment, gene manipulation, and <i>in vitro</i> culture as DNA transposon, chemotaxis and signaling, signal transduction, and secondary metabolic pathways, respectively. The analysis of functional module hub genes revealed the uniqueness of clinical human samples; however, under specific expression patterning, the Δ<i>hns</i>, Δ<i>oxyR1</i> strains, and tobramycin treatment group showed high expression profile similarity with human samples. By constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) interaction network, we discovered several unreported novel protein interactions within transposon functional modules. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> We used two techniques to integrate RNA-seq data for laboratory studies with clinical microarray data for the first time. The interactions between V. cholerae genes were obtained from a global perspective, as well as comparing the similarity between clinical human samples and the current experimental conditions, and uncovering the functional modules that play a major role under different conditions.

36847566,A Schema for Digitized Surface Swab Site Metadata in Open-Source DNA Sequence Databases.,"Large, open-source DNA sequence databases have been generated, in part, through the collection of microbial pathogens by swabbing surfaces in built environments. Analyzing these data in aggregate through public health surveillance requires digitization of the complex, domain-specific metadata that are associated with the swab site locations. However, the swab site location information is currently collected in a single, free-text, ""isolation source"", field-promoting generation of poorly detailed descriptions with various word order, granularity, and linguistic errors, making automation difficult and reducing machine-actionability. We assessed 1,498 free-text swab site descriptions that were generated during routine foodborne pathogen surveillance. The lexicon of free-text metadata was evaluated to determine the informational facets and the quantity of unique terms used by data collectors. Open Biological Ontologies (OBO) Foundry libraries were used to develop hierarchical vocabularies that are connected with logical relationships to describe swab site locations. 5 informational facets that were described by 338 unique terms were identified via content analysis. Term hierarchy facets were developed, as were statements (called axioms) about how the entities within these five domains are related. The schema developed through this study has been integrated into a publicly available pathogen metadata standard, facilitating ongoing surveillance and investigations. The One Health Enteric Package was available at NCBI BioSample, beginning in 2022. The collective use of metadata standards increases the interoperability of DNA sequence databases and enables large-scale approaches to data sharing and artificial intelligence as well as big-data solutions to food safety. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The regular analysis of whole-genome sequence data in collections such as NCBI's Pathogen Detection Database is used by many public health organizations to detect outbreaks of infectious disease. However, isolate metadata in these databases are often incomplete and of poor quality. These complex, raw metadata must often be reorganized and manually formatted for use in aggregate analyses. These processes are inefficient and time-consuming, increasing the interpretative labor needed by public health groups to extract actionable information.

Microbial species annotation is crucial to revealing microorganisms' complex ecological functions in environmental, ecological and host interactions. Currently, widely used methods can suffer from issues such as inaccurate species-level annotations and time and memory constraints, and as sequencing technology advances and sequencing costs decline, microbial species annotation methods with higher quality classification effectiveness become critical. Therefore, we processed 16S rRNA gene sequences into k-mers sets and then used a trained DNABERT model to generate word vectors. We also design a parallel network structure consisting of deep and shallow modules to extract the semantic and detailed features of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Our method can accurately and rapidly classify bacterial sequences at the SILVA database's genus and species level. The database is characterized by long sequence length (1500 base pairs), multiple sequences (428,748 reads) and high similarity. The results show that our method has better performance. The technique is nearly 20% more accurate at the species level than the currently popular naive Bayes-dominated QIIME 2 annotation method, and the top-5 results at the species level differ from BLAST methods by <2%.

37257197,A Cell-Free Gene Expression Platform for Discovering and Characterizing Stop Codon Suppressing tRNAs.,"Non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) can be incorporated into peptides and proteins to create new properties and functions. Site-specific ncAA incorporation is typically enabled by orthogonal translation systems comprising a stop codon suppressing tRNA (typically UAG), an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and an ncAA of interest. Unfortunately, methods to discover and characterize suppressor tRNAs are limited because of laborious and time-consuming workflows in living cells. In this work, we develop an<i>Escherichia coli</i> crude extract-based cell-free gene expression system to rapidly express and characterize functional suppressor tRNAs. Our approach co-expresses orthogonal tRNAs using endogenous machinery alongside a stop-codon containing superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) reporter, which can be used as a simple read-out for suppression. As a model, we evaluate the UAG and UAA suppressing activity of several orthogonal tRNAs. Then, we demonstrate that co-transcription of two mutually orthogonal tRNAs can direct the incorporation of two unique ncAAs within a single modified sfGFP. Finally, we show that the cell-free workflow can be used to discover putative UAG-suppressor tRNAs found in metagenomic data, which are nonspecifically recognized by endogenous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.

Numerous gene network inference (GNI) algorithms have been presented in the literature to infer accurate gene networks. We proposed a hybrid GNI algorithm, k-Strong Inference Algorithm (ksia), to infer more reliable and robust gene networks from omics datasets. To increase reliability, ksia integrates Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SCC) scores to determine mutual information scores between molecules to increase diversity of relation predictions. To infer a more robust gene network, ksia applies three different elimination steps to remove redundant and spurious relations between genes. The performance of ksia was evaluated on microbe microarrays database in the overlap analysis with other GNI algorithms, namely ARACNE, C3NET, CLR, and MRNET. Ksia inferred less number of relations due to its strict elimination steps. However, ksia generally performed better on Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) gene expression datasets due to F- measure and precision values.

40270544,An &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; systemic massively parallel platform for deciphering animal tissue-specific regulatory function.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Transcriptional regulation is an important process wherein non-protein coding enhancer sequences play a key role in determining cell type identity and phenotypic diversity. In neural tissue, these gene regulatory processes are crucial for coordinating a plethora of interconnected and regionally specialized cell types, ensuring their synchronized activity in generating behavior. Recognizing the intricate interplay of gene regulatory processes in the brain is imperative, as mounting evidence links neurodevelopment and neurological disorders to non-coding genome regions. While genome-wide association studies are swiftly identifying non-coding human disease-associated loci, decoding regulatory mechanisms is challenging due to causal variant ambiguity and their specific tissue impacts. <b>Methods:</b> Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are widely used in cell culture to study the non-coding enhancer regions, linking genome sequence differences to tissue-specific regulatory function. However, widespread use in animals encounters significant challenges, including insufficient viral library delivery and library quantification, irregular viral transduction rates, and injection site inflammation disrupting gene expression. Here, we introduce a systemic MPRA (sysMPRA) to address these challenges through systemic intravenous AAV viral delivery. <b>Results:</b> We demonstrate successful transduction of the MPRA library into diverse mouse tissues, efficiently identifying tissue specificity in candidate enhancers and aligning well with predictions from machine learning models. We highlight that sysMPRA effectively uncovers regulatory effects stemming from the disruption of MEF2C transcription factor binding sites, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and the consequences of genetic variations associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. <b>Conclusion:</b> SysMPRA is an effective library delivering method that simultaneously determines the transcriptional functions of hundreds of enhancers in vivo across multiple tissues.",False,True,,0.6344585,sysmpra,,7.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

We then construct a digitalized genotyping CNVb map across 1599 global wheat accessions. Key CNVb markers are linked with trait-associated introgressions, such as the 1RS·1BL translocation and 2N<sup>v</sup>S translocation, and the beneficial alleles, such as the end-use quality allele Glu-D1d (Dx5 + Dy10) and the semi-dwarf r-e-z allele.

However, the viral component (known as ""virome"") remains mostly unexplored. Here, we establish the Early-Life Gut Virome (ELGV), a catalog of 160,478 non-redundant DNA and RNA viral sequences from 8130 gut virus-like particles (VLPs) enriched or bulk metagenomes in the first three years of life. By clustering, 82,141 viral species are identified, 68.3% of which are absent in existing databases built mainly from adults, and 64 and 8 viral species based on VLPs-enriched and bulk metagenomes, respectively, exhibit potentials as biomarkers to distinguish infants from adults. With the largest longitudinal population of infants profiled by either VLPs-enriched or bulk metagenomic sequencing, we track the inherent instability and temporal development of the early-life human gut virome, and identify differential viruses associated with multiple clinical factors. The mother-infant shared virome and interactions between gut virome and bacteriome early in life are further expanded. Together, the ELGV catalog provides the most comprehensive and complete metagenomic blueprint of the early-life human gut virome, facilitating the discovery of pediatric disease-virome associations in future.",False,True,,0.63879377,early-life gut virome,,6.9914095,ok,,,elgv,v2,0.9914095,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

While several mouse retinal scRNA-seq datasets exist, each dataset is either limited in cell numbers or focused on specific cell classes, thereby hindering comprehensive gene expression analysis across all retina types. To fill the gap, we generated the largest retinal scRNA-seq dataset to date, comprising approximately 190,000 single cells from C57BL/6J mouse retinas, enriched for rare population cells via antibody-based magnetic cell sorting. Integrating this dataset with public datasets, we constructed the Mouse Retina Cell Atlas (MRCA) for wild-type mice, encompassing over 330,000 cells, characterizing 12 major classes and 138 cell types.

Elucidation of the functional roles played by the neural system could provide the missing links in developing a systems-level understanding of cancer biology. However, the existing information is highly fragmented and scattered across the literature and internet databases, making it difficult for cancer researchers to use. We have conducted computational analyses of transcriptomic data of cancer tissues in TCGA and tissues of healthy organs in GTEx, aiming to demonstrate how the functional roles by the neural genes could be derived and what non-neural functions they are associated with, across different stages of 26 cancer types. Several novel discoveries are made, including i) the expressions of certain neural genes can predict the prognosis of a cancer patient; ii) cancer metastasis tends to involve specific neural functions; iii) cancers of low survival rates involve more neural interactions than those with high survival rates; iv) more malignant cancers involve more complex neural functions; and v) neural functions are probably induced to alleviate stresses and help the associated cancer cells to survive.

Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to find the abnormalities in the lungs using chest X-rays specific to COVID-19 pneumonia and distinguish them from other etiologies of pneumonia. However, despite the enormous magnitude of the pandemic, there are very few instances of public databases of COVID-19 pneumonia, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no database with annotation of abnormalities on the chest X-rays of COVID-19 affected patients. Annotated databases of X-rays can be of significant value in the design and development of algorithms for disease prediction. Further, explainability analysis for the performance of existing or new deep learning algorithms will be enhanced significantly with access to ground-truth abnormality annotations. The proposed COVID Abnormality Annotation for X-Rays (CAAXR) database is built upon the BIMCV-COVID19+ database which is a large-scale dataset containing COVID-19+ chest X-rays. The primary contribution of this study is the annotation of the abnormalities in over 1700 frontal chest X-rays. Further, we define protocols for semantic segmentation as well as classification for robust evaluation of algorithms. We provide benchmark results on the defined protocols using popular deep learning models such as DenseNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG for classification, and UNet, SegNet, and Mask-RCNN for semantic segmentation.

This modification is known to be associated with the regulation and characterization of several biological functions and diseases. Therefore, accurate identification of nitrotyrosine sites plays a significant role in the elucidating progress of associated biological signs. In this regard, we reported an accurate computational tool known as iNTyro-Stack for the identification of protein nitrotyrosine sites. iNTyro-Stack is a machine-learning model based on a stacking algorithm. The base classifiers in stacking are selected based on the highest performance. The feature map employed is a linear combination of the amino composition encoding schemes, including the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs and tri-peptide composition. The recursive feature elimination technique is used for significant feature selection. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation and independent testing approaches. iNTyro-Stack achieved an accuracy of 86.3% and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 72.6% in cross-validation. Its generalization capability was further validated on an imbalanced independent test set, where it attained an accuracy of 69.32%. iNTyro-Stack outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both evaluation techniques.

37647283,Reconciliation and evolution of Penicillium rubens genome-scale metabolic networks-What about specialised metabolism?,"In recent years, genome sequencing of filamentous fungi has revealed a high proportion of specialised metabolites with growing pharmaceutical interest. However, detecting such metabolites through in silico genome analysis does not necessarily guarantee their expression under laboratory conditions. However, one plausible strategy for enabling their production lies in modifying the growth conditions. Devising a comprehensive experimental design testing in different culture environments is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, using in silico modelling as a preliminary step, such as Genome-Scale Metabolic Network (GSMN), represents a promising approach to predicting and understanding the observed specialised metabolite production in a given organism. To address these questions, we reconstructed a new high-quality GSMN for the Penicillium rubens Wisconsin 54-1255 strain, a commonly used model organism. Our reconstruction, iPrub22, adheres to current convention standards and quality criteria, incorporating updated functional annotations, orthology searches with different GSMN templates, data from previous reconstructions, and manual curation steps targeting primary and specialised metabolites. With a MEMOTE score of 74% and a metabolic coverage of 45%, iPrub22 includes 5,192 unique metabolites interconnected by 5,919 reactions, of which 5,033 are supported by at least one genomic sequence. Of the metabolites present in iPrub22, 13% are categorised as belonging to specialised metabolism. While our high-quality GSMN provides a valuable resource for investigating known phenotypes expressed in P. rubens, our analysis identifies bottlenecks related, in particular, to the definition of what is a specialised metabolite, which requires consensus within the scientific community. It also points out the necessity of accessible, standardised and exhaustive databases of specialised metabolites. These questions must be addressed to fully unlock the potential of natural product production in P. rubens and other filamentous fungi.

Mapping these 2D brain slices is challenging; due to deformations, artifacts, and tilted angles introduced during the standard preparation and slicing process. In addition, analysis of experimental mouse brain slices can be highly dependent on the level of expertise of the human operator. Here we propose a computational tool for Accurate Mouse Brain Image Analysis (AMBIA), to map 2D mouse brain slices on the 3D brain model with minimal human intervention. AMBIA has a modular design that comprises a localization module and a registration module. The localization module is a deep learning-based pipeline that localizes a single 2D slice in the 3D Allen Brain Atlas and generates a corresponding atlas plane. The registration module is built upon the Ardent python package that performs deformable 2D registration between the brain slice to its corresponding atlas. By comparing AMBIA's performance in localization and registration to human ratings, we demonstrate that it performs at a human expert level.

37864836,Fisheries data management systems in the NW Mediterranean: from data collection to web visualization.,"The European Union Data Collection Framework (DCF) states that scientific data-driven assessments are essential to achieve sustainable fisheries. To respond to the DCF call, this study introduces the information systems developed and used by Institut Català de Recerca per a la Governança del Mar (ICATMAR), the Catalan Institute of Research for the Governance of the Seas. The information systems include data from a biological monitoring, curation, processing, analysis, publication and web visualization for bottom trawl fisheries. Over the 4 years of collected data (2019-2022), the sampling program developed a dataset of over 1.1 million sampled individuals accounting for 24.6 tons of catch. The sampling data are ingested into a database through a data input website ensuring data management control and quality. The standardized metrics are automatically calculated and the data are published in the web visualizer, combined with fishing landings and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records. As the combination of remote sensing data with fisheries monitoring offers new approaches for ecosystem assessment, the collected fisheries data are also visualized in combination with georeferenced seabed habitats from the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet), climate and sea conditions from Copernicus Monitoring Environment Marine Service (CMEMS) on the web browser. Three public web-based products have been developed in the visualizer: geolocated bottom trawl samplings, biomass distribution per port or season and length-frequency charts per species. These information systems aim to fulfil the gaps in the scientific community, administration and civil society to access high-quality data for fisheries management, following the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles, enabling scientific knowledge transfer.

Analysing the landforms on the Loess Plateau is helpful for understanding changes in the surface environment. However, geomorphologic data with high resolution are lacking for the Loess Plateau, which limits the progress of geomorphologic studies at finer scales. This study provides the first 30 m resolution landform classification and characteristics dataset for the Loess Plateau (LPL30). Considering morphological characteristics, dominant dynamics, and material conditions, the landforms on the Loess Plateau were categorized into three levels with 28 landform types. Moreover, we calculated 6 metrics to quantify the spatial distribution and category composition of the landforms in 16 analytical units with different scales and shapes, resulting in 96 geomorphologic descriptors.

The special gut microbiome of social bees is a key factor in determining the overall fitness and health of the host. Although bees harbor relatively simple microbial communities at the genus level, recent studies have unveiled significant genetic divergence and variations in gene content within each bacterial genus. However, a comprehensive and refined genomics-based taxonomic database specific to social bee gut microbiomes remains lacking. Here, we first provided an overview of the current knowledge on the distribution and function of social bee gut bacteria, as well as the factors that influence the gut population dynamics. We then consolidated all available genomes of the gut bacteria of social bees and refined the species-level taxonomy, by constructing a maximum-likelihood core genome phylogeny and calculating genome-wide pairwise average nucleotide identity. On the basis of the refined species taxonomy, we constructed a curated genomic reference database, named the bee gut microbe genome sequence database (BGM-GDb). To evaluate the species-profiling performance of the curated BGM-GDb, we retrieved a series of bee gut metagenomic data and inferred the species-level composition using metagenomic intra-species diversity analysis system (MIDAS), and then compared the results with those obtained from a prebuilt MIDAS database. We found that compared with the default database, the BGM-GDb excelled in aligned read counts and bacterial richness.

38282330,"An ultra high-throughput, massively multiplexable, single-cell RNA-seq platform in yeasts.","Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow such that researchers can investigate any number of genotypes, environments, or interactions thereof. However, studies of yeast transcriptomes have been limited by the processing capabilities of traditional RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform, SPLiT-seq (Split Pool Ligation-based Transcriptome sequencing), for yeasts and apply it to 43,388 cells of multiple species and ploidies. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage ""the awesome power of yeast"" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since SPLiT-seq uses the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique perturbations in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity, given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here, we detect transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, ploidy, metabolic strategies, and so forth, all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.",False,True,,0.7073548,split-seq,,6.9707882,ok,,transcriptome sequencing,split | pool,v2,0.9707882,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Moreover, with the booming of pre-training language models (PLMs), the application prospect and promotion potential of machine learning methods in the relevant field have been further inspired. PLMs have recently achieved tremendous success in diverse text processing tasks, whereas limited by the significant semantic gap between the pre-training corpus and the structured electronic health records (EHRs), PLMs cannot converge to anticipated disease diagnosis and prediction results. Unfortunately, establishing connections between PLMs and EHRs typically requires the extraction of curated predictor variables from structured EHR resources, which is tedious and labor-intensive, and even discards vast implicit information.In this work, we propose an Input Prompting and Discriminative language model with the Mixture-of-experts framework (IPDM) by promoting the model's capabilities to learn knowledge from heterogeneous information and facilitating the feature-aware ability of the model. Furthermore, leveraging the prompt-tuning mechanism, IPDM can inherit the impacts of the pre-training in downstream tasks exclusively through minor modifications. IPDM remarkably outperforms existing models, proved by experiments on one disease diagnosis task and two disease prediction tasks. Finally, experiments with few-feature and few-sample demonstrate that IPDM achieves significant stability and impressive performance in predicting chronic diseases with unclear early-onset characteristics or sudden diseases with insufficient data, which verifies the superiority of IPDM over existing mainstream methods, and reveals the IPDM can powerfully address the aforementioned challenges via establishing a stable and low-resource medical diagnostic system for various clinical scenarios.",False,True,,0.6897098,,ipdm,6.9601389000000005,ok,,discriminative,,v2,0.9601389,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods' predictions.

37567984,A cluster-based trusted routing method using fire hawk optimizer (FHO) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).,"Today, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are growing rapidly and provide a lot of comfort to human life. Due to the use of WSNs in various areas, like health care and battlefield, security is an important concern in the data transfer procedure to prevent data manipulation. Trust management is an affective scheme to solve these problems by building trust relationships between sensor nodes. In this paper, a cluster-based trusted routing technique using fire hawk optimizer called CTRF is presented to improve network security by considering the limited energy of nodes in WSNs. It includes a weighted trust mechanism (WTM) designed based on interactive behavior between sensor nodes. The main feature of this trust mechanism is to consider the exponential coefficients for the trust parameters, namely weighted reception rate, weighted redundancy rate, and energy state so that the trust level of sensor nodes is exponentially reduced or increased based on their hostile or friendly behaviors. Moreover, the proposed approach creates a fire hawk optimizer-based clustering mechanism to select cluster heads from a candidate set, which includes sensor nodes whose remaining energy and trust levels are greater than the average remaining energy and the average trust level of all network nodes, respectively. In this clustering method, a new cost function is proposed based on four objectives, including cluster head location, cluster head energy, distance from the cluster head to the base station, and cluster size. Finally, CTRF decides on inter-cluster routing paths through a trusted routing algorithm and uses these routes to transmit data from cluster heads to the base station. In the route construction process, CTRF regards various parameters such as energy of the route, quality of the route, reliability of the route, and number of hops. CTRF runs on the network simulator version 2 (NS2), and its performance is compared with other secure routing approaches with regard to energy, throughput, packet loss rate, latency, detection ratio, and accuracy.

39792931,Enterprise internal audit data encryption based on blockchain technology.,"Internal auditing demands innovative and secure solutions in today's business environment, with increasing competitive pressure and frequent occurrences of risky and illegal behaviours. Blockchain along with secure databases like encryption improves internal audit security through immutability and transparency. Hence integrating blockchain with homomorphic encryption and multi-factor authentication improves privacy and mitigates computational overhead. Recently, blockchain applications for internal audits in the enterprise sector are still emerging. Thus, blockchain technology in auditing provides the benefits of enhanced transparency and immutability in data processing, which can establish new solutions for internal auditing but still lacks encryption techniques. The research proposed a framework called ""BlockCryptoAudit"" to enhance internal audit processes through cryptographic encryption methods and blockchain technology, ensuring secure and transparent audit operations. The proposed approach integrates an additive homomorphic Paillier encryption scheme with blockchain to create a safe and tamper-resident audit trail. Utilizing homomorphic Paillier encryption, BlockCryptoAudit ensures that computations may be performed on encrypted audit data while safeguarding data privacy. The applied blockchain hyperledger component guarantees the immutability and transparency of encrypted audit records, resulting in a decentralized and tamper-resistant record. By limiting data accessibility to authorized individuals based on specified responsibilities, role-based access restrictions handled using smart contracts further strengthen security. The study protects audit data's security and confidentiality by encrypting it and putting it on a blockchain. The study compares the proposed BlockCryptoAudit with models like B-OAP, BSE-DF, and EG-FLB regarding risk mitigation, audit quality, security overhead, and audit trail effectiveness. With little security overhead, BlockCryptoAudit beats out B-OAP, BSE-DF, and EG-FLB in terms of risk mitigation (98%) and audit quality (99%).

However, these models are generally incomplete due to experimental limitations in acquiring multiple (> 4) fluorescent channels in thick tissue sections simultaneously. Indeed, predictive geometrical and functional models of the liver have been restricted to few tissue and cellular components, excluding important cellular populations such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells (KCs). Here, we combined deep-tissue immunostaining, multiphoton microscopy, deep-learning techniques, and 3D image processing to computationally expand the number of simultaneously reconstructed tissue structures. We then generated a spatial single-cell atlas of hepatic architecture (Hep3D), including all main tissue and cellular components at different stages of post-natal development in mice. We used Hep3D to quantitatively study 1) hepatic morphodynamics from early post-natal development to adulthood, and 2) the effect on the liver's overall structure when changing the hepatic environment after removing KCs. In addition to a complete description of bile canaliculi and sinusoidal network remodeling, our analysis uncovered unexpected spatiotemporal patterns of non-parenchymal cells and hepatocytes differing in size, number of nuclei, and DNA content. Surprisingly, we found that the specific depletion of KCs results in morphological changes in hepatocytes and HSCs. These findings reveal novel characteristics of liver heterogeneity and have important implications for both the structural organization of liver tissue and its function.

39658207,Augmenting small biomedical datasets using generative AI methods based on self-organizing neural networks.,"Small sample sizes in biomedical research often led to poor reproducibility and challenges in translating findings into clinical applications. This problem stems from limited study resources, rare diseases, ethical considerations in animal studies, costly expert diagnosis, and others. As a contribution to the problem, we propose a novel generative algorithm based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) to computationally increase sample sizes. The proposed unsupervised generative algorithm uses neural networks to detect inherent structure even in small multivariate datasets, distinguishing between sparse ""void"" and dense ""cloud"" regions. Using emergent SOMs (ESOMs), the algorithm adapts to high-dimensional data structures and generates for each original data point k new points by randomly selecting positions within an adapted hypersphere with distances based on valid neighborhood probabilities. Experiments on artificial and biomedical (omics) datasets show that the generated data preserve the original structure without introducing artifacts. Random forests and support vector machines cannot distinguish between generated and original data, and the variables of original and generated data sets are not statistically different. The method successfully augments small group sizes, such as transcriptomics data from a rare form of leukemia and lipidomics data from arthritis research. The novel ESOM-based generative algorithm presents a promising solution for enhancing sample sizes in small or rare case datasets, even when limited training data are available. This approach can address challenges associated with small sample sizes in biomedical research, offering a tool for improving the reliability and robustness of scientific findings in this field.

Strict quality verification procedures were conducted on variant calls with the whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset of the 1000 Genomes Project (G1K). The accuracy of PGx allele identification was validated using the WGS dataset of the Pharmacogenetics Reference Materials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<h4>Results</h4>The newly created bioinformatics pipeline, Pgxtools, can analyze genomic sequence data, identify actionable variants in 13 PGx relevant genes, and generate reports annotated with specific interpretations and recommendations based on clinical practice guidelines. Verified with two independent methods, we have found that Pgxtools consistently identifies variants more accurately than the results in the G1K dataset on GRCh37 and GRCh38.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Pgxtools provides an integrated workflow for large-scale genomic data analysis and PGx clinical decision support. Implemented with cloud-native technologies, it is highly portable in a wide variety of environments from a single laptop to High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters and cloud platforms for different production scales and requirements.",False,True,,0.6847378,pgxtools,,6.9491757,ok,,gxtools,,v2,0.9491757,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37468574,A framework for comparative study of databases and computational methods for arrhythmia detection from single-lead ECG.,"Arrhythmia detection from ECG is an important area of computational ECG analysis. However, although a large number of public ECG recordings are available, most research uses only few datasets, making it difficult to estimate the generalizability of the plethora of ECG classification methods. Furthermore, there is a large variability in the evaluation procedures, as well as lack of insight into whether they could successfully perform in a real-world setup. To address these problems, we propose an open-source, flexible and configurable ECG classification codebase-ECGDL, as one of the first efforts that includes 9 arrhythmia datasets, covering a large number of both morphological and rhythmic arrhythmias, as well as 4 deep neural networks, 4 segmentation techniques and 4 evaluation schemes. We perform a comparative analysis along these framework components to provide a comprehensive perspective into arrhythmia classification, focusing on single-lead ECG as the most recent trend in wireless ECG monitoring. ECGDL unifies the class information representation in datasets by creating a label dictionary. Furthermore, it includes a set of the best-performing deep learning approaches with varying signal segmentation techniques and network architectures.

Containing 397,180 species-level viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), RVD substantially increases the detection rate of rumen viruses from metagenomes compared with IMG/VR V3. Most of the classified vOTUs belong to Caudovirales, differing from those found in the human gut. The rumen virome is predicted to infect the core rumen microbiome, including fiber degraders and methanogens, carries diverse auxiliary metabolic genes, and thus likely impacts the rumen ecosystem in both a top-down and a bottom-up manner.

Here, we integrate 120 transcriptome sequencing datasets and 38 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing datasets of the model phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae to illustrate how bacterial TCSs dynamically govern their regulatory roles under changing environments. We reveal themes of conservation and variability in bacterial gene regulations in response to changing environments by developing a network-based PSTCSome (Pseudomonas syringae TCS regulome) containing 232 and 297 functional genes under King's B medium and minimal medium conditions, respectively.

39066514,Improving biomedical entity linking for complex entity mentions with LLM-based text simplification.,"Large amounts of important medical information are captured in free-text documents in biomedical research and within healthcare systems, which can be made accessible through natural language processing (NLP). A key component in most biomedical NLP pipelines is entity linking, i.e. grounding textual mentions of named entities to a reference of medical concepts, usually derived from a terminology system, such as the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms. However, complex entity mentions, spanning multiple tokens, are notoriously hard to normalize due to the difficulty of finding appropriate candidate concepts. In this work, we propose an approach to preprocess such mentions for candidate generation, building upon recent advances in text simplification with generative large language models. We evaluate the feasibility of our method in the context of the entity linking track of the BioCreative VIII SympTEMIST shared task. We find that instructing the latest Generative Pre-trained Transformer model with a few-shot prompt for text simplification results in mention spans that are easier to normalize. Thus, we can improve recall during candidate generation by 2.9 percentage points compared to our baseline system, which achieved the best score in the original shared task evaluation. Furthermore, we show that this improvement in recall can be fully translated into top-1 accuracy through careful initialization of a subsequent reranking model.

38913855,Optimizing data integration improves gene regulatory network inference in Arabidopsis thaliana.,"<h4>Motivations</h4>Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are traditionally inferred from gene expression profiles monitoring a specific condition or treatment. In the last decade, integrative strategies have successfully emerged to guide GRN inference from gene expression with complementary prior data. However, datasets used as prior information and validation gold standards are often related and limited to a subset of genes. This lack of complete and independent evaluation calls for new criteria to robustly estimate the optimal intensity of prior data integration in the inference process.<h4>Results</h4>We address this issue for two regression-based GRN inference models, a weighted random forest (weigthedRF) and a generalized linear model estimated under a weighted LASSO penalty with stability selection (weightedLASSO). These approaches are applied to data from the root response to nitrate induction in Arabidopsis thaliana. For each gene, we measure how the integration of transcription factor binding motifs influences model prediction. We propose a new approach, DIOgene, that uses model prediction error and a simulated null hypothesis in order to optimize data integration strength in a hypothesis-driven, gene-specific manner. This integration scheme reveals a strong diversity of optimal integration intensities between genes, and offers good performance in minimizing prediction error as well as retrieving experimental interactions. Experimental results show that DIOgene compares favorably against state-of-the-art approaches and allows to recover master regulators of nitrate induction.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The R code and notebooks demonstrating the use of the proposed approaches are available in the repository https://github.com/OceaneCsn/integrative_GRN_N_induction.",False,True,,0.68738854,diogene,,6.9387949,ok,,,,v2,0.9387949,,False,0.0,False,False,https://github.com/OceaneCsn/integrative_GRN_N_induction,,False,,1

Drought events were identified as periods of at least three months where significantly dry conditions affected 20% or more of the study area, defined as grid cells with SPI values lower than -0.84. Our analysis revealed a total of 40 major drought events. Our catalogue contains detailed information on each episode's spatial extent, duration, severity, and spatio-temporal dynamics. The analysis of the propagation patterns of the events unveils substantial heterogeneity, implying that droughts stem from diverse atmospheric mechanisms, further influenced by complex local topography.

This makes it highly promising for use in biotechnological production as a cell factory, as well as in bioremediation strategies to degrade various aromatic pollutants. For P. putida to flourish in its environment, it must withstand the continuous threats posed by bacteriophages. Interestingly, until now, only a handful of phages have been isolated for the commonly used laboratory strain, P. putida KT2440, and no phage defence mechanisms have been characterized. In this study, we present a new Collection of Environmental P. putida Phages from Estonia, or CEPEST. This collection comprises 67 double-stranded DNA phages, which belong to 22 phage species and 9 phage genera. Our findings reveal that most phages in the CEPEST collection are more infectious at lower temperatures, have a narrow host range, and require an intact lipopolysaccharide for P. putida infection. Furthermore, we show that cryptic prophages present in the P. putida chromosome provide strong protection against the infection of many phages. However, the chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems do not play a role in the phage defence of P. putida.

The discovery of chicken cholera vaccine in 1879 revolutionized our fight against bacterial infections. Bacterial vaccines are proven to be highly effective in preventing many infectious diseases. Currently, various licensed vaccines are available against bacterial infections such as typhoid, diphtheria, cholera and tetanus in the market.

37848535,Novel Alzheimer's disease genes and epistasis identified using machine learning GWAS platform.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex genetic disease, and variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only part of its heritability. Epistasis has been proposed as a major contributor to this 'missing heritability', however, many current methods are limited to only modelling additive effects. We use VariantSpark, a machine learning approach to GWAS, and BitEpi, a tool for epistasis detection, to identify AD associated variants and interactions across two independent cohorts, ADNI and UK Biobank. By incorporating significant epistatic interactions, we captured 10.41% more phenotypic variance than logistic regression (LR). We validate the well-established AD loci, APOE, and identify two novel genome-wide significant AD associated loci in both cohorts, SH3BP4 and SASH1, which are also in significant epistatic interactions with APOE. We show that the SH3BP4 SNP has a modulating effect on the known pathogenic APOE SNP, demonstrating a possible protective mechanism against AD. SASH1 is involved in a triplet interaction with pathogenic APOE SNP and ACOT11, where the SASH1 SNP lowered the pathogenic interaction effect between ACOT11 and APOE.

To address the problem of few training samples and contrast-limited scene, we proposed a new binarization framework with specific-patch SVM (SPSVM) for low-intensity OCT image, which is open and classification-based framework. This new framework contains two phases: training model and binarization threshold. In the training phase, firstly, the patches of target and background from few training samples are extracted as the ROI and the background, respectively. Then, PCA is conducted on all patches to reduce the dimension and learn the eigenvector subspace. Finally, the classification model is trained from the features of patches to get the target value of different patches. In the testing phase, the learned eigenvector subspace is conducted on the pixels of each patch. The binarization threshold of patch is obtained with the learned SVM model.

40062614,Learning directed acyclic graphs for ligands and receptors based on spatially resolved transcriptomic data of ovarian cancer.,"To unravel the mechanism of immune activation and suppression within tumors, a critical step is to identify transcriptional signals governing cell-cell communication between tumor and immune/stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. Central to this communication are interactions between secreted ligands and cell-surface receptors, creating a highly connected signaling network among cells. Recent advancements in in situ-omics profiling, particularly spatial transcriptomic (ST) technology, provide unique opportunities to directly characterize ligand-receptor signaling networks that power cell-cell communication. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical method, LRnetST, to characterize the ligand-receptor interaction networks between adjacent tumor and immune/stroma cells based on ST data. LRnetST utilizes a directed acyclic graph model with a novel approach to handle the zero-inflated distributions of ST data. It also leverages existing ligand-receptor regulation databases as prior information, and employs a bootstrap aggregation strategy to achieve robust network estimation. Application of LRnetST to ST data of high-grade serous ovarian tumor samples revealed both common and distinct ligand-receptor regulations across different tumors. Some of these interactions were validated through both a MERFISH dataset and a CosMx SMI dataset of independent ovarian tumor samples.

Fairness index updates are periodic towards multi-user allocations to meet the QoS demands. In this article, a Connected Resource Map-induced Resource Allocation Scheme (CRM-RAS) is introduced. The proposed scheme identifies radio and user resource availability and constructs an allocation map from the primary users. For a periodic allocation interval, the map's fairness index is updated through maximum resource utilization and QoS factor. This QoS factor is computed based on low latency and high allocation rates that are directly proportional to the fairness index. The fairness index is verified using distributed federated learning that is active between the primary and secondary user terminals. If the fairness index drops below the actual allocation rate, then the scheduling for resource allocation with concurrency is pursued. Based on the improving fairness index through concurrent scheduling the distributed federated learning encourages consecutive radio resource allocation. Thus the process is repeated until the allocation map is confined to a one-to-one connectivity between the primary and secondary users.

40471940,Advancing sentiment analysis for low-resourced african languages using pre-trained language models.,"While sentiment analysis systems excel in high-resource languages, most African languages facing limited resources, remain under-represented. This gap leaves a significant portion of the world's population without access to technologies in their native languages. However, multilingual pre-trained language models (PLM) offer a promising approach for sentiment analysis in low-resource languages. Although the absence of large data in African languages poses a challenge for developing PLMs, fine-tuning and task adaptation of existing multilingual PLMs is an alternative solution. This paper explores the use of multilingual PLMs for sentiment analysis in five Southern African languages: Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, isiXhosa, and isiZulu. We leverage existing PLMs and fine-tune them for this specific task, avoiding training the models from scratch. Our work expands on the SAfriSenti corpus, a Twitter sentiment dataset for these languages. We employ various annotation techniques to create a labelled dataset and perform benchmark experiments utilising various multilingual PLMs. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of multilingual PLM, particularly for closely-related languages (Sotho-Tswana), where the ensemble PLMs method achieved an average weighted F1 score above 63%.

36873900,Restaining-based annotation for cancer histology segmentation to overcome annotation-related limitations among pathologists.,"Numerous cancer histopathology specimens have been collected and digitized over the past few decades. A comprehensive evaluation of the distribution of various cells in tumor tissue sections can provide valuable information for understanding cancer. Deep learning is suitable for achieving these goals; however, the collection of extensive, unbiased training data is hindered, thus limiting the production of accurate segmentation models. This study presents SegPath-the largest annotation dataset (>10 times larger than publicly available annotations)-for the segmentation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections for eight major cell types in cancer tissue. The SegPath generating pipeline used H&E-stained sections that were destained and subsequently immunofluorescence-stained with carefully selected antibodies.

It is ubiquitous, and its systematic characterization is discussed. Moreover, I discover a mathematical conversion relationship translating energy generation to carbon emissions. Various case-studies demonstrate the optimal energy resource utilization. Furthermore, an energy blockchain approach is employed for microgrid design, development, and carbon reduction.

40301713,Systematic evaluation of the isolated effect of tissue environment on the transcriptome using a single-cell RNA-seq atlas dataset.,"<h4>Background</h4>Understanding cellular diversity throughout the body is essential for elucidating the complex functions of biological systems. Recently, large-scale single-cell omics datasets, known as omics atlases, have become available. These atlases encompass data from diverse tissues and cell-types, providing insights into the landscape of cell-type-specific gene expression. However, the isolated effect of the tissue environment has not been thoroughly investigated. Evaluating this isolated effect is challenging due to statistical confounding with cell-type effects, which arises from the highly limited subset of tissue-cell-type combinations that are biologically realized compared to the vast number of theoretical possibilities.<h4>Results</h4>This study introduces a novel data analysis framework, named the Combinatorial Sub-dataset Extraction for Confounding Reduction (COSER), which addresses statistical confounding by using graph theory to enumerate appropriate sub-datasets. COSER enables the assessment of isolated effects of discrete variables in single cells. Applying COSER to the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell transcriptome atlas, we characterized the isolated impact of tissue environments. Our findings demonstrate that some genes are markedly affected by the tissue environment, particularly in modulating intercellular diversity in immune responses and their age-related changes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>COSER provides a robust, general-purpose framework for evaluating the isolated effects of discrete variables from large-scale data mining. This approach reveals critical insights into the interplay between tissue environments and gene expression.",False,True,,0.6822782,,coser,6.9037881,ok,,extraction for confounding reduction | combinatorial sub-dataset extraction for confounding reduction,oser,v2,0.9037881,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
35680932,A Chinese multi-modal neuroimaging data release for increasing diversity of human brain mapping.,"The big-data use is becoming a standard practice in the neuroimaging field through data-sharing initiatives. It is important for the community to realize that such open science effort must protect personal, especially facial information when raw neuroimaging data are shared. An ideal tool for the face anonymization should not disturb subsequent brain tissue extraction and further morphological measurements. Using the high-resolution head images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 215 healthy Chinese, we discovered and validated a template effect on the face anonymization. Improved facial anonymization was achieved when the Chinese head templates but not the Western templates were applied to obscure the faces of Chinese brain images. This finding has critical implications for international brain imaging data-sharing. To facilitate the further investigation of potential culture-related impacts on and increase diversity of data-sharing for the human brain mapping, we released the 215 Chinese multi-modal MRI data into a database for imaging Chinese young brains, namely'I See your Brains (ISYB)', to the public via the Science Data Bank ( https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00740 ).",False,True,,0.600946,,isyb,6.89715666,ok,,your brains,,v2,0.89715666,,False,0.0,False,False,https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00740,,False,,1

37142360,A centralized resource for bacterial-fungal interactions research.,"Research on bacterial-fungal interactions (BFIs) has revealed that fungi and bacteria frequently interact with one another within diverse ecosystems and microbiomes. Assessing the current state of knowledge within the field of BFI research, particularly with respect to what interactions between bacteria and fungi have been previously described, is very challenging and time consuming. This is largely due to a lack of any centralized resource, with reports of BFIs being spread across publications in numerous journals using non-standardized text to describe the relationships. To address this issue, we have developed the BFI Research Portal, a publicly accessible database of previously reported interactions between bacterial and fungal taxa to serve as a centralized resource for the field. Users can query bacterial or fungal taxa to see what members from the other kingdom have been observed as interaction partners. Search results are accompanied by interactive and intuitive visual outputs, and the database is a dynamic resource that will be updated as new BFIs are reported.",False,True,,0.7135723,,bfi,6.8906218,ok,,bfi research portal,,v2,0.8906218,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40493136,Perfect Taxon Sampling and Fixing Taxon Traceability: Introducing a Class of Phylogenetically Decisive Collections of Taxon Sets.,"Phylogenetically decisive collections of taxon sets have the property that if trees are chosen for each of their elements, as long as these trees are compatible, the resulting supertree is unique. This means that as long as the trees describing the phylogenetic relationships of the (input) species sets are compatible, they can only be combined into a common supertree in precisely one way. This setting is sometimes also referred to as ""perfect taxon sampling"". While for rooted trees, the decision if a given set of input taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive can be made in polynomial time, the decision problem to determine whether a collection of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive concerning unrooted trees is unfortunately coNP-complete and therefore in practice hard to solve for large instances. This shows that recognizing such sets is often difficult. In this paper, we explain phylogenetic decisiveness and introduce a class of input taxon sets, namely so-called fixing taxon traceable sets, which are guaranteed to be phylogenetically decisive and which can be recognized in polynomial time. Using both combinatorial approaches as well as simulations, we compare properties of fixing taxon traceability and phylogenetic decisiveness, e.g., by deriving lower and upper bounds for the number of quadruple sets (i.e., sets of 4-tuples) needed in the input set for each of these properties. In particular, we correct an erroneous lower bound concerning phylogenetic decisiveness from the literature. We have implemented the algorithm to determine if a given collection of taxon sets is fixing taxon traceable in R and made our software package FixingTaxonTraceR publicly available.",False,True,,0.70502514,fixingtaxontracer,,6.8812754,ok,,,,v2,0.8812754,Perfect Taxon Sampling and Fixing Taxon Traceability,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40346170,Multi-user joint task offloading and resource allocation based on mobile edge computing in mining scenarios.,"With the development of the industrial internet of things, an increasing number of intelligent terminal devices are being deployed in mining operations. However, due to the surge in network traffic and the limited availability of computational resources, these terminal devices face challenges in meeting high-performance requirements such as low transmission latency and low energy consumption. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method that combines partial offloading with collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC). This approach leverages device-to-device communication to partition computational tasks into multiple subtasks, offloading some of them to collaborative devices or MEC servers for execution. This not only alleviates the computational burden on MEC servers but also makes full use of the idle computing resources of terminal devices, thereby enhancing resource utilization efficiency. Given the limited computational capacity of terminal devices, this paper optimizes the offloading decision-making process between terminal devices and MEC servers. By introducing weighted coefficients for latency and energy consumption, the proposed method ensures that task completion latency does not exceed a predefined threshold while minimizing the overall system cost. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is solved using a two-layer alternating optimization framework. In the upper layer, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) based on heuristic rules is employed to generate an offloading decision population, while the lower layer utilizes the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to optimize the offloading strategy and the weighted coefficients for latency and energy consumption. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare it with five baseline algorithms: the improved grey wolf optimizer metaheuristic algorithm, the traditional genetic algorithm, the binary offloading decision mechanism, the partial non-cooperative mechanism, and the fully local execution mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IGA-DDPG algorithm achieves significant improvements over these baseline methods. Specifically, under various experimental scenarios, IGA-DDPG reduces latency by an average of 24.5%, decreases energy consumption by 26.3%, and lowers overall system cost by 44.6%. Moreover, the algorithm consistently ensures a 100% task completion rate under different system configurations.",False,True,,0.6648257,,iga-ddpg,6.8793643,ok,,,,v2,0.8793643,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40281126,Peer-driven task scheduling and resource allocation for enhanced performance in industrial IoT systems.,"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems in the smart industry, enhanced by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), provide a robust framework for efficiently managing and processing distributed tasks. However, resource sharing and allocation in these systems, often conducted one-to-one, can lead to task stagnancy when multiple resources are required in sequence. This paper proposes a novel Peer-dependent Scheduling and Allocation Scheme (PSAS) that leverages predictive learning to optimize task scheduling and resource allocation to address this limitation. The scheme evaluates resource availability, task length, and deadlines to minimize stagnancy and maximize system throughput. Predictive learning in PSAS enhances decision-making by analyzing historical resource utilization and providing real-time recommendations for resource allocation. This approach ensures scalability, reduces delays in task completion, and enhances overall system reliability, marking a significant advancement in P2P-based IIoT systems. Key performance metrics, including task processing ratio, processing time, stagnancy factor, and wait time, demonstrate that PSAS outperforms existing methods by improving processing ratio by up to 10.62% and reducing stagnancy by 5.06%.",False,True,,0.6647405,peer-dependent scheduling and allocation scheme,,6.87600774,ok,,,iiot | psas,v2,0.87600774,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

This study bridges that gap by analyzing over 50 million transactions from Uniswap, a major decentralized exchange, across both L1 and L2 networks. We created a set of daily indices from blockchain data on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, offering insights into DeFi adoption, scalability, decentralization, and wealth distribution.

However, with big data comes big responsibilities, and best practices for how data are contributed to databases have not kept pace with the collection, aggregation, and analysis of big data. Here, we rigorously assess the quantity of data for specific leaf area (SLA) available within the largest and most frequently used global plant trait database, the TRY Plant Trait Database, exploring how much of the data were applicable (i.e., original, representative, logical, and comparable) and traceable (i.e., published, cited, and consistent). Over three-quarters of the SLA data in TRY either lacked applicability or traceability, leaving only 22.9% of the original data usable compared with the 64.9% typically deemed usable by standard data cleaning protocols. The remaining usable data differed markedly from the original for many species, which led to altered interpretation of ecological analyses. Though the data we consider here make up only 4.5% of SLA data within TRY, similar issues of applicability and traceability likely apply to SLA data for other species as well as other commonly measured, uploaded, and downloaded plant traits. We end with suggested steps forward for global ecological databases, including suggestions for both uploaders to and curators of databases with the hope that, through addressing the issues raised here, we can increase data quality and integrity within the ecological community.",False,True,,0.6778885,,try,6.8688756,ok,,,,v2,0.8688756,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
35255810,A multi-network integration approach for measuring disease similarity based on ncRNA regulation and heterogeneous information.,"<h4>Background</h4>Measuring similarity between complex diseases has significant implications for revealing the pathogenesis of diseases and development in the domain of biomedicine. It has been consentaneous that functional associations between disease-related genes and semantic associations can be applied to calculate disease similarity. Currently, more and more studies have demonstrated the profound involvement of non-coding RNA in the regulation of genome organization and gene expression. Thus, taking ncRNA into account can be useful in measuring disease similarities. However, existing methods ignore the regulation functions of ncRNA in biological process. In this study, we proposed a novel deep-learning method to deduce disease similarity.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we proposed a novel method, ImpAESim, a framework integrating multiple networks embedding to learn compact feature representations and disease similarity calculation. We first utilize three different disease-related information networks to build up a heterogeneous network, after a network diffusion process, RWR, a compact feature learning model composed of classic Auto Encoder (AE) and improved AE model is proposed to extract constraints and low-dimensional feature representations. We finally obtain an accurate and low-dimensional feature representation of diseases, then we employed the cosine distance as the measurement of disease similarity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ImpAESim focuses on extracting a low-dimensional vector representation of features based on ncRNA regulation, and gene-gene interaction network.

39186522,A local community on a global collective intelligence platform: A case study of individual preferences and collective bias in ecological citizen science.,"The collective intelligence of crowds could potentially be harnessed to address global challenges, such as biodiversity loss and species' extinction. For wisdom to emerge from the crowd, certain conditions are required. Importantly, the crowd should be diverse and people's contributions should be independent of one another. Here we investigate a global citizen-science platform-iNaturalist-on which citizens report on wildlife observations, collectively producing maps of species' spatiotemporal distribution. The organization of global platforms such as iNaturalist around local projects compromises the assumption of diversity and independence, and thus raises concerns regarding the quality of such collectively-generated data. We spent four years closely immersing ourselves in a local community of citizen scientists who reported their wildlife sightings on iNaturalist. Our ethnographic study involved the use of questionnaires, interviews, and analysis of archival materials. Our analysis revealed observers' nuanced considerations as they chose where, when, and what type of species to monitor, and which observations to report. Following a thematic analysis of the data, we organized observers' preferences and constraints into four main categories: recordability, community value, personal preferences, and convenience. We show that while some individual partialities can ""cancel each other out"", others are commonly shared among members of the community, potentially biasing the aggregate database of observations. Our discussion draws attention to the way in which widely-shared individual preferences might manifest as spatial, temporal, and crucially, taxonomic biases in the collectively-created database. We offer avenues for continued research that will help better understand-and tackle-individual preferences, with the goal of attenuating collective bias in data, and facilitating the generation of reliable state-of-nature reports.

35895741,A deep semantic vegetation health monitoring platform for citizen science imaging data.,"Automated monitoring of vegetation health in a landscape is often attributed to calculating values of various vegetation indexes over a period of time. However, such approaches suffer from an inaccurate estimation of vegetational change due to the over-reliance of index values on vegetation's colour attributes and the availability of multi-spectral bands. One common observation is the sensitivity of colour attributes to seasonal variations and imaging devices, thus leading to false and inaccurate change detection and monitoring. In addition, these are very strong assumptions in a citizen science project. In this article, we build upon our previous work on developing a Semantic Vegetation Index (SVI) and expand it to introduce a semantic vegetation health monitoring platform to monitor vegetation health in a large landscape. However, unlike our previous work, we use RGB images of the Australian landscape for a quarterly series of images over six years (2015-2020). This Semantic Vegetation Index (SVI) is based on deep semantic segmentation to integrate it with a citizen science project (Fluker Post) for automated environmental monitoring. It has collected thousands of vegetation images shared by various visitors from around 168 different points located in Australian regions over six years. This paper first uses a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model to classify vegetation in repeated photographs. A semantic vegetation index is then calculated and plotted in a time series to reflect seasonal variations and environmental impacts. The results show variational trends of vegetation cover for each year, and the semantic segmentation model performed well in calculating vegetation cover based on semantic pixels (overall accuracy = 97.7%).

Although the water solubility is besides the octanol-water partition coefficient, melting point, and boiling point a property with a large amount of available experimental data, there are still more compounds in the chemical universe for which information on their water solubility is lacking. Thus, prediction tools with a broad application domain are needed to fill the corresponding data gaps. To this end, we developed a graph convolutional neural network model (GNN) to predict the water solubility in the form of log S<sub>w</sub> based on a highly curated dataset of 9800 chemicals. We started our model development with a curation workflow of the AqSolDB data, ending with 7605 data points. We added 2195 chemicals with experimental data, which we found in the literature, to our dataset. In the final dataset, log S<sub>w</sub> values range from - 13.17 to 0.50. Higher values were excluded by a cut-off introduced to eliminate fully miscible chemicals. We developed a consensus GNN by a fivefold split of the corresponding training set (70% of the data) and validation set (20%) and used 10% as independent test set for the evaluation of the performance of the different splits and the consensus model. By doing so, we achieved an r<sup>2</sup> of 0.901, a q<sup>2</sup> of 0.896, and an rmse of 0.657 on our independently selected test set, which is close to the experimental error of 0.5 to 0.6 log units.

In this manuscript, we describe how we leverage an Ontology-Based Data Management (OBDM) strategy for digital transformation in Novo Nordisk Research & Early Development. Here, we include both our technical blueprint and our approach for organizational change management. We further discuss how such an OBDM ecosystem plays a pivotal role in the organization's digital aspirations for data federation and discovery fuelled by artificial intelligence.

39809781,Soil erosion susceptibility maps and raster dataset for the hydrological basins of North Africa.,"Soil erosion in North Africa modulates agricultural and urban developments as well as the impacts of flash floods. Existing investigations and associated datasets are mainly performed in localized urban areas, often representing a limited part of a watershed. The above compromises the implementation of mitigation measures for this vast area under accentuating extremes and continuous hydroclimatic fluctuations. To address this deficiency, we use the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation to map surface erosion, providing the first insight into the decadal impacts of land degradation, which are largely unconstrained on North Africa's continental scale. We generate soil erosion maps for the major hydrological basins of North Africa using Google Earth Engine and multiple hydroclimatic and land use datasets, covering 5.8 million square kilometers. The generated geospatial dataset integrates land use, soil erodibility, slope, vegetation cover, and land practices. The resulting product is an expansive and publicly available Soil erosion susceptibility maps and rasters dataset (SESMAR). This dataset is a crucial step toward understanding the drivers of soil erosion in this vast, poorly characterized area as well as its potential to be used for future soil conservation campaigns for both agricultural and urban planning. We validate SESMAR using the Global Rainfall Erosivity Database (GloREDa) and the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) datasets as well as published peer-reviewed reports across 20 watersheds, demonstrating a robust agreement in assessing the average annual soil loss values and soil erosion classes in local areas covered by independent study teams.

36834553,Thinking on the Construction of Antimicrobial Peptide Databases: Powerful Tools for the Molecular Design and Screening.,"With the accelerating growth of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), there is an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents with low or no AMR. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been extensively studied as alternatives to antibiotics (ATAs). Coupled with the new generation of high-throughput technology for AMP mining, the number of derivatives has increased dramatically, but manual running is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, it is necessary to establish databases that combine computer algorithms to summarize, analyze, and design new AMPs. A number of AMP databases have already been established, such as the Antimicrobial Peptides Database (APD), the Collection of Antimicrobial Peptides (CAMP), the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP), and the Database of Antimicrobial Peptides (dbAMPs). These four AMP databases are comprehensive and are widely used. This review aims to cover the construction, evolution, characteristic function, prediction, and design of these four AMP databases. It also offers ideas for the improvement and application of these databases based on merging the various advantages of these four peptide libraries.

It enhances expression as well as secretion of the fusion partner and allows for simple purification of several structurally and functionally distinct fusion proteins. Furthermore, it improves the biophysical characteristics of most fusion proteins tested, is inert, and does not compromise the fusion partners' functionality.

39820608,Multiview attention networks for fine-grained watershed categorization via knowledge distillation.,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, an increasing number of village-related modeling problems have been addressed. However, first, the exploration of village-related watershed fine-grained classification problems, particularly the multi-view watershed fine-grained classification problem, has been hindered by dataset collection limitations; Second, village-related modeling networks typically employ convolutional modules for attentional modeling to extract salient features, yet they lack global attentional feature modeling capabilities; Lastly, the extensive number of parameters and significant computational demands render village-related watershed fine-grained classification networks infeasible for end-device deployment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a multi-view attention mechanism designed for precise watershed classification, leveraging knowledge distillation techniques, abbreviated as MANet-KD. Specifically, first, we have developed the inaugural multi-view watershed classification dataset, termed MVWD.Second, we introduce a cross-view attention module (CVAM), which models salient features from intersecting views with global attention, enhancing the accuracy and precision of watershed classification. This module enhances fine-grained classification accuracy. Based on the above proposed CVAM, we propose a heavyweight MANet-Teacher and a lightweight MANet-Student, and finally, we introduce an Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) strategy that effectively transfers critical feature knowledge from the teacher network to the student network, utilizing the AKD approach for enhanced learning outcomes. The experimental results show that the proposed MANet-Teacher achieves state-of-the-art performance with 78.51% accuracy, and the proposed MANet-Student achieves comparable performance to MANet-Teacher with 6.64M parameters and 1.68G computation. The proposed MANet-KD achieves a good balance of performance and efficiency in the multi-view fine-grained watershed classification task.

For the situation lacking labeled data, supervised methods are invalid for the issue of domain shift in data distribution. In this paper, a adversarial-based domain adaptation (ADA) architecture with convolution neural networks (CNN) for RUL estimation of bearings under different conditions and platforms, referred to as ADACNN, is proposed. Specifically, ADACNN is trained in source labeled data and fine-tunes to similar target unlabeled data via an adversarial training and parameters shared mechanism. Besides a feature extractor and source domain regressive predictor, ADACNN also includes a domain classifier that tries to guide feature extractor find some domain-invariant features, which differents with traditional methods and belongs to a unsupervised learning in target domain, which has potential application value and far-reaching significance in academia. In addition, according to different first predictive time (FPT) detection mechanisms, we also explores the impact of different FPT detection mechanisms on RUL estimation performance. Finally, according to extensive experiments, the results of RUL estimation of bearing in cross-condition and cross-platform prove that ADACNN architecture has satisfactory generalization performance and great practical value in industry.",False,True,,0.6569851,,adacnn,6.8112679,ok,,,cnn | rul,v2,0.8112679,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37287133,Improving the identification of miRNA-disease associations with multi-task learning on gene-disease networks.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of non-coding RNA molecules with vital roles in regulating gene expression. Although researchers have recognized the importance of miRNAs in the development of human diseases, it is very resource-consuming to use experimental methods for identifying which dysregulated miRNA is associated with a specific disease. To reduce the cost of human effort, a growing body of studies has leveraged computational methods for predicting the potential miRNA-disease associations. However, the extant computational methods usually ignore the crucial mediating role of genes and suffer from the data sparsity problem. To address this limitation, we introduce the multi-task learning technique and develop a new model called MTLMDA (Multi-Task Learning model for predicting potential MicroRNA-Disease Associations). Different from existing models that only learn from the miRNA-disease network, our MTLMDA model exploits both miRNA-disease and gene-disease networks for improving the identification of miRNA-disease associations. To evaluate model performance, we compare our model with competitive baselines on a real-world dataset of experimentally supported miRNA-disease associations. Empirical results show that our model performs best using various performance metrics. We also examine the effectiveness of model components via ablation study and further showcase the predictive power of our model for six types of common cancers.

Understanding the various mechanisms underlying crosstalk on a global scale requires untargeted computational approaches. We present a network-based statistical approach, MuXTalk, that uses high-dimensional edges called multilinks to model the unique ways in which signaling and regulatory interactions can interface. We demonstrate that the signaling-regulatory interface is located primarily in the intermediary region between signaling pathways where crosstalk occurs, and that multilinks can differentiate between distinct signaling-transcriptional mechanisms. Using statistically over-represented multilinks as proxies of crosstalk, we infer crosstalk among 60 signaling pathways, expanding currently available crosstalk databases by more than five-fold. MuXTalk surpasses existing methods in terms of model performance metrics, identifies additions to manual curation efforts, and pinpoints potential mediators of crosstalk. Moreover, it accommodates the inherent context-dependence of crosstalk, allowing future applications to cell type- and disease-specific crosstalk.",False,True,,0.7106015,muxtalk,,6.8094988,ok,,,,v2,0.8094988,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37208694,Combatting over-specialization bias in growing chemical databases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Predicting in advance the behavior of new chemical compounds can support the design process of new products by directing the research toward the most promising candidates and ruling out others. Such predictive models can be data-driven using Machine Learning or based on researchers' experience and depend on the collection of past results. In either case: models (or researchers) can only make reliable assumptions about compounds that are similar to what they have seen before. Therefore, consequent usage of these predictive models shapes the dataset and causes a continuous specialization shrinking the applicability domain of all trained models on this dataset in the future, and increasingly harming model-based exploration of the space.<h4>Proposed solution</h4>In this paper, we propose CANCELS (CounterActiNg Compound spEciaLization biaS), a technique that helps to break the dataset specialization spiral. Aiming for a smooth distribution of the compounds in the dataset, we identify areas in the space that fall short and suggest additional experiments that help bridge the gap. Thereby, we generally improve the dataset quality in an entirely unsupervised manner and create awareness of potential flaws in the data. CANCELS does not aim to cover the entire compound space and hence retains a desirable degree of specialization to a specified research domain.<h4>Results</h4>An extensive set of experiments on the use-case of biodegradation pathway prediction not only reveals that the bias spiral can indeed be observed but also that CANCELS produces meaningful results. Additionally, we demonstrate that mitigating the observed bias is crucial as it cannot only intervene with the continuous specialization process, but also significantly improves a predictor's performance while reducing the number of required experiments. Overall, we believe that CANCELS can support researchers in their experimentation process to not only better understand their data and potential flaws, but also to grow the dataset in a sustainable way.

The dataset includes five cow behaviors: standing, lying down, foraging,rumination and drinking. The dataset comprises 107 cows from the entire barn, maintaining an 80% stocking density. Monitoring occurred over 96 h for these 20-month-old cows, considering varying light conditions and nighttime data to ensure standardization and inclusivity.The dataset consists of ranch monitoring footage collected by seven cameras, including 687 video segment samples and 206,100 image samples, covering five daily behaviors of cows. The data collection process entailed the deployment of cameras, hard drives, software, and servers for storage. Data annotation was conducted using the VIA web tool, leveraging the video expertise of pertinent professionals. The annotation coordinates and category labels of each individual cow in the image, as well as the generated configuration file, are also saved in the dataset. With this dataset,we propose a slowfast cow multi behavior recognition model based on video sequences as the baseline evaluation model. The experimental results show that the model can effectively learn corresponding category labels from the behavior type data of the dataset, with an error rate of 21.28% on the test set. In addition to cow behavior recognition, the dataset can also be used for cow target detection, and so on.The CBVD-5 dataset significantly influences dairy cow behavior recognition, advancing research, enriching data resources, standardizing datasets, enhancing dairy cow health and welfare monitoring, and fostering agricultural intelligence development.

40163043,How to Train a Postprocessor for Tandem Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Database Search While Maintaining Control of the False Discovery Rate.,"Decoy-based methods are a popular choice for the statistical validation of peptide detection in tandem mass spectrometry and proteomics data. Such methods can achieve a substantial boost in statistical power when coupled with postprocessors such as Percolator that use auxiliary features to learn a better-discriminating scoring function. However, we recently showed that Percolator can struggle to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when reporting the list of discovered peptides. To address this problem, we introduce Percolator-RESET, which is an adaptation of our recently developed RESET meta-procedure to the peptide detection problem. Specifically, Percolator-RESET fuses Percolator's iterative SVM training procedure with RESET's general framework to provide valid false discovery rate control. Percolator-RESET operates in both a standard single-decoy mode and a two-decoy mode, with the latter requiring the generation of two decoys per target. We demonstrate that Percolator-RESET controls the FDR in both modes, both theoretically and empirically, while typically reporting only a marginally smaller number of discoveries than Percolator in the single-decoy mode. The two-decoy mode is marginally more powerful than both Percolator and the single-decoy mode and exhibits less variability than the latter.",False,True,,0.6940048,,reset,6.79590017,ok,,,eset,v2,0.79590017,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

We provide a statistical characterisation of the user behaviour emerging from the interplay of such competing forces in Stack Overflow, a long-standing knowledge sharing platform. Over the 11 years covered by our analysis, we represent the interactions between users and topics as bipartite networks. We find such networks to display nested structures akin to those observed in ecological systems, demonstrating that the platform's user base consistently self-organises into specialists and generalists, i.e., users who focus on narrow and broad sets of topics, respectively. We relate the emergence of these behaviours to the platform's reputation system with a series of data-driven models, and find specialisation to be statistically associated with a higher ability to post the best answers to a question.

To enable discovery of pathogen effectors and further our understanding of virulence evolution, we generated a chromosome-scale assembly for each of the 2 nuclear genomes of the oat crown rust pathogen, Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca). This resource complements 2 previously released partially phased genome references of Pca, which display virulence traits absent in the isolate of historic race 203 (isolate Pca203) which was selected for this genome project.

39085892,Joint extraction of Chinese medical entities and relations based on RoBERTa and single-module global pointer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Most Chinese joint entity and relation extraction tasks in medicine involve numerous nested entities, overlapping relations, and other challenging extraction issues. In response to these problems, some traditional methods decompose the joint extraction task into multiple steps or multiple modules, resulting in local dependency in the meantime.<h4>Methods</h4>To alleviate this issue, we propose a joint extraction model of Chinese medical entities and relations based on RoBERTa and single-module global pointer, namely RSGP, which formulates joint extraction as a global pointer linking problem. Considering the uniqueness of Chinese language structure, we introduce the RoBERTa-wwm pre-trained language model at the encoding layer to obtain a better embedding representation. Then, we represent the input sentence as a third-order tensor and score each position in the tensor to prepare for the subsequent process of decoding the triples. In the end, we design a novel single-module global pointer decoding approach to alleviate the generation of redundant information. Specifically, we analyze the decoding process of single character entities individually, improving the time and space performance of RSGP to some extent.<h4>Results</h4>In order to verify the effectiveness of our model in extracting Chinese medical entities and relations, we carry out the experiments on the public dataset, CMeIE. Experimental results show that RSGP performs significantly better on the joint extraction of Chinese medical entities and relations, and achieves state-of-the-art results compared with baseline models.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed RSGP can effectively extract entities and relations from Chinese medical texts and help to realize the structure of Chinese medical texts, so as to provide high-quality data support for the construction of Chinese medical knowledge graphs.",False,True,,0.69774157,,rsgp,6.72385347,ok,,,,v2,0.72385347,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

LAMP eliminates the need for thermal cycling, resulting in simplified instrumentation, and the CRISPR-associated protein (Cas 12a) system eliminates false positive signals from LAMP products, resulting in highly selective and sensitive assays. We optimized the assay to perform both amplification and detection entirely on paper, eliminating the need for complex fluid handling steps and lateral flow assay transfers. Additionally, we engineered a smartphone-operated system that includes a low-powered, non-contact IR heating chamber to actuate paper-based LAMP and CRISPR reactions and enable the detection of fluorescent signals from the paper. The platform demonstrates high specificity and sensitivity in detecting nucleic acid targets with a limit of detection of 50 copies/μL. We integrate an equipment-free sample preparation separation technology designed to streamline the preparation of crude samples prior to nucleic acid testing. The practical utility of our platform is demonstrated by the successful detection of spiked SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in saliva, E. Coli in soil, and pathogenic E.

35388048,Hierarchical multi-label classification based on LSTM network and Bayesian decision theory for LncRNA function prediction.,"Growing evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in cellular biological processes at multiple levels, such as gene imprinting, immune response, and genetic regulation, and are closely related to diseases because of their complex and precise control. However, most functions of lncRNAs remain undiscovered. Current computational methods for exploring lncRNA functions can avoid high-throughput experiments, but they usually focus on the construction of similarity networks and ignore the certain directed acyclic graph (DAG) formed by gene ontology annotations. In this paper, we view the function annotation work as a hierarchical multilabel classification problem and design a method HLSTMBD for classification with DAG-structured labels. With the help of a mathematical model based on Bayesian decision theory, the HLSTMBD algorithm is implemented with the long-short term memory network and a hierarchical constraint method DAGLabel.

However, despite continued discovery of new protein structures to date, the Ramachandran plot is still constructed by only a small number of data points, and further it cannot reflect the steric information of proteins. Here, we investigated the secondary structure of proteins in terms of static and dynamic characteristics. As for static feature, the Ramachandran plot was revisited for the dataset consisting of 9,148 non-redundant high-resolution protein structures released in the protein data bank until April 1, 2022. By calculating amino acid propensities, it was found that the proportion of secondary structures with respect to residue depth is directly related to their hydrophobicity. As for dynamic feature, normal mode analysis (NMA) based on an elastic network model (ENM) was carried out for the dataset using our KOSMOS web server (http://bioengineering.skku.ac.kr/kosmos/). All ENM-based NMA results were stored in the KOSMOS database, allowing researchers to use them in various ways. In this process, it was commonly found that high B-factors appeared at the edge of the alpha helix region, which was elucidated by introducing residue depth. In addition, by investigating the change in dihedral angle, it was possible to quantitatively survey the contribution of structural change of protein on the Ramachandran plot.

We here present an approach to mining knowledge graphs by combining manual curation with automated named entity recognition and automated relation extraction. This approach allows us to study pathway-related questions in detail, which we here show using the ketamine pathway, aiming to help improve understanding of the role of gut microbiota in the antidepressant effects of ketamine.<h4>Results</h4>The thus devised ketamine pathway 'KetPath' knowledge graph comprises five parts: (i) manually curated pathway facts from images; (ii) recognized named entities in biomedical texts; (iii) identified relations between named entities; (iv) our previously constructed microbiota and pre-/probiotics knowledge bases; and (v) multiple community-accepted public databases. We first assessed the performance of automated extraction of relations between named entities using the specially designed state-of-the-art tool BioKetBERT. The query results show that we can retrieve drug actions, pathway relations, co-occurring entities, and their relations. These results uncover several biological findings, such as various gut microbes leading to increased expression of BDNF, which may contribute to the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine. We envision that the methods and findings from this research will aid researchers who wish to integrate and query data and knowledge from multiple biomedical databases and literature simultaneously.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Data and query protocols are available in the KetPath repository at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8398941 and https://github.com/tingcosmos/KetPath.",False,True,,0.71544343,ketamine pathway,,6.7057209,ok,,ketpath,bdnf,v2,0.7057209,,False,0.0,False,False,https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8398941 | https://github.com/tingcosmos/KetPath,,False,,1
36920090,Inter-domain distance prediction based on deep learning for domain assembly.,"AlphaFold2 achieved a breakthrough in protein structure prediction through the end-to-end deep learning method, which can predict nearly all single-domain proteins at experimental resolution. However, the prediction accuracy of full-chain proteins is generally lower than that of single-domain proteins because of the incorrect interactions between domains. In this work, we develop an inter-domain distance prediction method, named DeepIDDP. In DeepIDDP, we design a neural network with attention mechanisms, where two new inter-domain features are used to enhance the ability to capture the interactions between domains. Furthermore, we propose a data enhancement strategy termed DPMSA, which is employed to deal with the absence of co-evolutionary information on targets. We integrate DeepIDDP into our previously developed domain assembly method SADA, termed SADA-DeepIDDP. Tested on a given multi-domain benchmark dataset, the accuracy of SADA-DeepIDDP inter-domain distance prediction is 11.3% and 21.6% higher than trRosettaX and trRosetta, respectively. The accuracy of the domain assembly model is 2.5% higher than that of SADA. Meanwhile, we reassemble 68 human multi-domain protein models with TM-score ≤ 0.80 from the AlphaFold protein structure database, where the average TM-score is improved by 11.8% after the reassembly by our method.

39468204,Efficient and secure service function chain deployment method for delay optimization in air traffic information network.,"The air traffic information network is fundamental for ensuring the efficient and safe operation of flights. However, with the increasing demands of air traffic services, the rigidity of the traditional air traffic information network has become increasingly pronounced. Network function virtualization (NFV) technology presents an effective solution to address this issue. Within the NFV environment, the deployment of service function chains (SFC) forms the basis for achieving end-to-end air traffic services. This paper addresses the low delay and high security requirements inherent in air traffic services and proposes an efficient and secure SFC deployment for delay optimization (ESSFCD-DO) method. Primarily, the paper conducts a theoretical analysis of SFC deployment, and derives four key principles related to SFC delay, security, and resource cost. Subsequently, based on these principles, the ESSFCD-DO method is developed, which encompasses the virtual network function (VNF) aggregation algorithm for security and resources cost optimization (VNFAA-SRCO), the VNF deployment algorithm based on topology aware (VNFD-TA), and the algorithm for deploying virtual links based on k-shortest path. Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison to other SFC deployment methods within this domain, ESSFCD-DO achieves significant optimizations in terms of end-to-end delay of SFC and long-term revenue-cost ratio, while ensuring security and service request acceptance rate.",False,True,,0.6522126,,ssfcd,6.70123833,ok,,,essfcd-do,v2,0.70123833,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Leveraging a non-contact and high-precision 3D scanning method for surface capture, a high-resolution and whole-body hand contact dataset, named as Ti3D-contact, is constructed in this work. The dataset, with an average resolution of 0.72 mm, contains 1872 sets of texture images and 3D models. The contact area during hand operation is whole-body painted on gloves, which are captured as the high-resolution original hand contact data through a 3D scanner.

The traditional construction of DAGs through literature review and expert knowledge often needs to be more systematic and consistent, leading to potential biases. We try to introduce an automatic approach to building network linking variables of interest.<h4>Methods</h4>Large-scale text mining from medical literature was utilized to construct a conceptual network based on the Semantic MEDLINE Database (SemMedDB). SemMedDB is a PubMed-scale repository of the ""concept-relation-concept"" triple format. Relations between concepts are categorized as Excitatory, Inhibitory, or General.<h4>Results</h4>To facilitate the use of large-scale triple sets in SemMedDB, we have developed a computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) system (https://cbk.bjmu.edu.cn/), a website that enables direct retrieval of related publications and their corresponding triples without the necessity of writing SQL statements. Three case studies were elaborated to demonstrate the applications of the CBK system.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The CBK system is openly available and user-friendly for rapidly capturing a set of influencing factors for a phenotype and building candidate DAGs between exposure-outcome variables. It could be a valuable tool to reduce the exploration time in considering relationships between variables, and constructing a DAG.

37117327,Iterative heterogeneous graph learning for knowledge graph-based recommendation.,"Incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation systems has attracted wide attention in various fields recently. A Knowledge graph contains abundant information with multi-type relations among multi-type nodes. The heterogeneous structure reveals not only the connectivity but also the complementarity between the nodes within a KG, which helps to capture the signal of potential interest of the user. However, existing research works have limited abilities in dealing with the heterogeneous nature of knowledge graphs, resulting in suboptimal recommendation results. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation method based on iterative heterogeneous graph learning on knowledge graphs (HGKR). By treating a knowledge graph as a heterogeneous graph, HGKR achieves more fine-grained modeling of knowledge graphs for recommendation. Specifically, we incorporate the graph neural networks into the message passing and aggregating of entities within a knowledge graph both at the graph and the semantic level. Furthermore, we designed a knowledge-perceiving item filter based on an attention mechanism to capture the user's potential interest in their historical preferences for the enhancement of recommendation.

Extracting essential oils from underutilised biomass is an economic and sustainable method for the production of high-added-value products. These days, countries’ ownership of domestic natural resources is becoming vital, so there is an urgent need for developing the essential oils from native plants. To increase the value of native essential oils in South Korea, the National Institute of Forest Science (NiFoS) established the <Essential oils bank> to develop the native essential oils as well as develop more research infrastructure by sharing information on native essential oils and enhancing their value. We review the selected essential oils which are listed in the <Essential oil bank> from the literature on major chemical constituents, biological activity, and potential uses of essential oils. Those utilising forest resources for commercial essential oil production need to consider the stable supply of plant material in terms of forest management and conservation. Therefore, Pinaceae (Larix kaempferi, Pinus densiflora, Pinus koraiensis) and Cupressaceae (Chamaecyparis obtusa and Chamaecyparis pisifera) could be potential candidates for commercial essential oil as their waste materials are easily obtained from the plantation after forest management.

First, two EcN cryptic plasmids and other compatible plasmids were genetically engineered to enrich the manipulable plasmid toolbox for multiple gene coexpression. Next, two EcN-based technologies were developed, including the conjugation strategy for DNA transfer, and quantification of protein expression capability. Finally, the EcN-based applications were further expanded by developing EcN native integrase-mediated genetic engineering and establishing an in vitro cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system.

However, high-throughput data detailing the effect of CAP on cancer cells is lacking, let alone the corresponding database and analytical tool. Here, we sequenced the whole transcriptome, proteome, phosphorylome, acetylome, and lactylome of transformed cells in response to CAP using breast cancer cells as the disease model; and advanced our previously developed Hiplot platform by establishing a focus-driven tumor-specific module, namely CAP medicine in breast cancer (CAPmed-BC) (https://capbc.hiplot.com.cn). CAPmed-BC is the first multi-omics data resource in plasma medicine for analyzing the treatment response of breast cancer cells to CAP. It can analyze each type of omics data regarding differentially expressed biomarkers, expression landscape, gene ontology analysis, pathway interpretation, gene set enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network.

35845738,"A Secure Framework toward IoMT-Assisted Data Collection, Modeling, and Classification for Intelligent Dermatology Healthcare Services.","The abnormal growth of the skin cells is known as skin cancer. It is one of the main problems in the dermatology area. Skin lesions or malignancies have been a source of worry for many individuals in recent years. Irrespective of the skin tone, there exist three major classes of skin lesions, i.e., basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The early diagnosis of these lesions is equally important for human life. In the proposed work, a secure IoMT-Assisted framework is introduced that can help the patients to do the initial screening of skin lesions remotely. The initially proposed approach uses an IoMT-based data collection device which is accessible by patients to capture skin lesions images. Next, the captured skin sample is encrypted and sent to the collected image toward cloud storage. Later, the received sample image is classified into appropriate class labels using an ensemble classifier. In the proposed framework, four CNN models were ensemble i.e., VGG-16, DenseNet-201, Inception-V3, and Efficient-B7. The framework has experimented with the ""HAM10000"" dataset having 7 different kinds of skin lesions data. Although DenseNet-201 performed well, the ensemble model provides the highest accuracy with 87.22 percent as well as its test loss/error is lower than others with 0.4131.

39368529,Augmenting biomedical named entity recognition with general-domain resources.,"<h4>Objective</h4>Training a neural network-based biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) model usually requires extensive and costly human annotations. While several studies have employed multi-task learning with multiple BioNER datasets to reduce human effort, this approach does not consistently yield performance improvements and may introduce label ambiguity in different biomedical corpora. We aim to tackle those challenges through transfer learning from easily accessible resources with fewer concept overlaps with biomedical datasets.<h4>Methods</h4>We proposed GERBERA, a simple-yet-effective method that utilized general-domain NER datasets for training. We performed multi-task learning to train a pre-trained biomedical language model with both the target BioNER dataset and the general-domain dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the models specifically for the BioNER dataset.<h4>Results</h4>We systematically evaluated GERBERA on five datasets of eight entity types, collectively consisting of 81,410 instances. Despite using fewer biomedical resources, our models demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models trained with additional BioNER datasets. Specifically, our models consistently outperformed the baseline models in six out of eight entity types, achieving an average improvement of 0.9% over the best baseline performance across eight entities. Our method was especially effective in amplifying performance on BioNER datasets characterized by limited data, with a 4.7% improvement in F1 scores on the JNLPBA-RNA dataset.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study introduces a new training method that leverages cost-effective general-domain NER datasets to augment BioNER models. This approach significantly improves BioNER model performance, making it a valuable asset for scenarios with scarce or costly biomedical datasets.

40348905,Optimizing energy and load management in island microgrids for enhancing resilience against resource interruptions.,"The increasing integration of distributed renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS), electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and demand response (DR) mechanisms has significantly enhanced microgrid deployment. However, the operational complexity and vulnerability of islanded microgrids to disruptions, especially during renewable energy fluctuations, pose critical challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on minimizing operational costs or emissions but fail to simultaneously address load curtailment, voltage stability, and resilience under uncertain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel resilience-oriented energy and load management framework for island microgrids, integrating a multi-objective optimization function that explicitly minimizes load curtailment, energy losses, voltage deviations, emissions, and energy procurement costs while maximizing the utilization of renewable energy sources. Unlike conventional models that separately optimize demand-side management (DSM), distributed generation (DG), EV charging/discharging, and ESS scheduling, our approach incorporates a coordinated control strategy that jointly optimizes these elements alongside reactive power compensation devices such as capacitors and shunt reactors. To effectively solve this high-dimensional, nonlinear problem, we employ the Multi-objective Moth Flame Algorithm (MOMFA), an enhanced metaheuristic evolutionary algorithm designed to handle complex trade-offs between cost, reliability, and resilience. The superiority of MOMFA over conventional optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is validated through simulations on a realistic 33-node microgrid under various renewable energy outage scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 60% reduction in voltage deviation, an 81% decrease in energy losses, and an 86% reduction in CO₂ emissions, while ensuring zero load curtailment, even under severe outage conditions. The proposed method offers a scalable, real-time implementable solution for microgrid operators seeking to enhance resilience against renewable energy intermittency and optimize energy utilization.

38166563,Functional annotation of a divergent genome using sequence and structure-based similarity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microsporidia are a large taxon of intracellular pathogens characterized by extraordinarily streamlined genomes with unusually high sequence divergence and many species-specific adaptations. These unique factors pose challenges for traditional genome annotation methods based on sequence similarity. As a result, many of the microsporidian genomes sequenced to date contain numerous genes of unknown function. Recent innovations in rapid and accurate structure prediction and comparison, together with the growing amount of data in structural databases, provide new opportunities to assist in the functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we established a workflow that combines sequence and structure-based functional gene annotation approaches employing a ChimeraX plugin named ANNOTEX (Annotation Extension for ChimeraX), allowing for visual inspection and manual curation. We employed this workflow on a high-quality telomere-to-telomere sequenced tetraploid genome of Vairimorpha necatrix. First, the 3080 predicted protein-coding DNA sequences, of which 89% were confirmed with RNA sequencing data, were used as input. Next, ColabFold was used to create protein structure predictions, followed by a Foldseek search for structural matching to the PDB and AlphaFold databases. The subsequent manual curation, using sequence and structure-based hits, increased the accuracy and quality of the functional genome annotation compared to results using only traditional annotation tools. Our workflow resulted in a comprehensive description of the V. necatrix genome, along with a structural summary of the most prevalent protein groups, such as the ricin B lectin family. In addition, and to test our tool, we identified the functions of several previously uncharacterized Encephalitozoon cuniculi genes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We provide a new functional annotation tool for divergent organisms and employ it on a newly sequenced, high-quality microsporidian genome to shed light on this uncharacterized intracellular pathogen of Lepidoptera.

However, current technologies have sequence limitations or require specialized synthetic reagents for N-terminal peptide isolation. Here, we introduce an N terminomics toolbox that combines selective N-terminal biotinylation using 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2PCA) reagents with chemically cleavable linkers to enable efficient enrichment of protein N termini. By incorporating a commercially available alkyne-modified 2PCA in combination with Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), our strategy eliminates the need for chemical synthesis of N-terminal probes. Using these reagents, we developed PICS2 (Proteomic Identification of Cleavage Sites with 2PCA) to profile the specificity of subtilisin/kexin-type proprotein convertases (PCSKs). We also implemented CHOPPER (chemical enrichment of protease substrates with purchasable, elutable reagents) for global sequencing of apoptotic proteolytic cleavage sites.

However, due to the significant concentration of time and space in large-scale sports events, which leads to a surge in computation-intensive tasks, making traditional network models difficult to cope with such high demands. Fortunately, with the advantages of flexible deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), UAV-assisted edge computing technology provides an innovative solution. This paper studies the resource allocation problem in UAV-assisted edge computing system for large-scale sport events. Our goal is to minimize system energy consumption while satisfying system performance. We formulate the problem as a long-term stochastic optimization problem. To address this issue, we propose the efficient dynamic resource allocation (EDRA) algorithm. By employing stochastic optimization techniques, the original problem is decomposed into multiple sub-problems that can be solved in parallel. We solve each subproblem through convex optimization and linear programming. Through theoretical analysis, we prove the gap between the proposed solution and the optimal solution.

However, the present satellite-derived SIF datasets are accessible only at coarse spatial resolutions, constraining its applications at fine scales. Here, we utilized a weighted stacking algorithm to generate a high spatial resolution SIF dataset (500 m, 8-day) in China (HCSIF) from 2000 to 2022 from the TROPOMI with a spatial resolution at a nadir of 3.5 km by 5.6-7 km.

Dysregulation of NEAT1_2/paraspeckles has been linked to multiple human diseases making them an attractive drug target. However currently NEAT1_2/paraspeckle-focused translational research and drug discovery are hindered by a limited toolkit. To fill this gap, we developed and validated a set of tools for the identification of NEAT1_2 binders and modulators comprised of biochemical and cell-based assays. The NEAT1_2 triple helix stability element was utilized as the target in the biochemical assays, and the cellular assay ('ParaQuant') was based on high-content imaging of NEAT1_2 in fixed cells. As a proof of principle, these assays were used to screen a 1,200-compound FDA-approved drug library and a 170-compound kinase inhibitor library and to confirm the screening hits. The assays are simple to establish, use only commercially-available reagents and are scalable for higher throughput. In particular, ParaQuant is a cost-efficient assay suitable for any cells growing in adherent culture and amenable to multiplexing.

The Italian Collection of Antarctic Bacteria (<i>Collezione Italiana Batteri Antartici</i> (CIBAN)), managed by the University of Messina, represents a valuable repository of cold-adapted bacterial strains isolated from various Antarctic environments. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 58 marine Gammaproteobacteria strains from the CIBAN collection, which were isolated during Italian expeditions from 1990 to 2005. By employing genome-scale metrics, we taxonomically characterized these strains and assigned them to four distinct genera: <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Pseudoalteromonas</i>, <i>Shewanella,</i> and <i>Psychrobacter</i>. Genome annotation revealed a previously untapped functional potential, including secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and antibiotic resistance genes.

37723446,"Combining unsupervised, supervised and rule-based learning: the case of detecting patient allergies in electronic health records.","<h4>Background</h4>Data mining of electronic health records (EHRs) has a huge potential for improving clinical decision support and to help healthcare deliver precision medicine. Unfortunately, the rule-based and machine learning-based approaches used for natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare today all struggle with various shortcomings related to performance, efficiency, or transparency.<h4>Methods</h4>In this paper, we address these issues by presenting a novel method for NLP that implements unsupervised learning of word embeddings, semi-supervised learning for simplified and accelerated clinical vocabulary and concept building, and deterministic rules for fine-grained control of information extraction. The clinical language is automatically learnt, and vocabulary, concepts, and rules supporting a variety of NLP downstream tasks can further be built with only minimal manual feature engineering and tagging required from clinical experts. Together, these steps create an open processing pipeline that gradually refines the data in a transparent way, which greatly improves the interpretable nature of our method. Data transformations are thus made transparent and predictions interpretable, which is imperative for healthcare. The combined method also has other advantages, like potentially being language independent, demanding few domain resources for maintenance, and able to cover misspellings, abbreviations, and acronyms. To test and evaluate the combined method, we have developed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) named Information System for Clinical Concept Searching (ICCS) that implements the method for clinical concept tagging, extraction, and classification.<h4>Results</h4>In empirical studies the method shows high performance (recall 92.6%, precision 88.8%, F-measure 90.7%), and has demonstrated its value to clinical practice. Here we employ a real-life EHR-derived dataset to evaluate the method's performance on the task of classification (i.e., detecting patient allergies) against a range of common supervised learning algorithms. The combined method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the alternative methods we evaluate. We also perform a qualitative analysis of common word embedding methods on the task of word similarity to examine their potential for supporting automatic feature engineering for clinical NLP tasks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on the promising results, we suggest more research should be aimed at exploiting the inherent synergies between unsupervised, supervised, and rule-based paradigms for clinical NLP.",False,True,,0.6854546,system for clinical concept searching,,6.66092545,ok,,,,v2,0.66092545,"Combining unsupervised, supervised and rule-based learning",False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

While these approaches have revolutionized our understanding of heterogeneity, in isolation they cannot correlate phenotypic information within a physiologically relevant live-cell state with molecular profiles. This inability to integrate a live-cell phenotype-such as invasiveness, cell:cell interactions, and changes in spatial positioning-with multi-omic data creates a gap in understanding cellular heterogeneity. We sought to address this gap by employing lab technologies to design a detailed protocol, termed Spatiotemporal Genomic and Cellular Analysis (SaGA), for the precise imaging-based selection, isolation, and expansion of phenotypically distinct live cells. This protocol requires cells expressing a photoconvertible fluorescent protein and employs live cell confocal microscopy to photoconvert a user-defined single cell or set of cells displaying a phenotype of interest. The total population is then extracted from its microenvironment, and the optically highlighted cells are isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorting. SaGA-isolated cells can then be subjected to multi-omics analysis or cellular propagation for in vitro or in vivo studies. This protocol can be applied to a variety of conditions, creating protocol flexibility for user-specific research interests. The SaGA technique can be accomplished in one workday by non-specialists and results in a phenotypically defined cellular subpopulations for integration with multi-omics techniques.

This end-to-end workflow extends from original sample to loading the mass spectrometer and is centered on a one-tube homogenization and digestion method called Heat 'n Beat (HnB). It is applicable to most tissues, regardless of how they were fixed or embedded. Sample preparation was divided into separate challenges. The initial sample washing and final peptide cleanup steps were adapted to three tissue sources: fresh frozen (FF), optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound embedded (FF-OCT), and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE). Third, for core processing, tissue disruption and lysis were decreased to a 7 min heat and homogenization treatment, and reduction, alkylation, and proteolysis were optimized into a single step. The refinements produced near doubled peptide yield when compared to our earlier method ABLE delivered a consistently high digestion efficiency of 85-90%, reported by ProteinPilot, and required only 38 min for core processing in a single tube, with the total processing time being 53-63 min.

The common strategy of computing consensus orthologs introduces additional arbitrariness, emphasizing the need to examine the causes of such inconsistencies and identify proteins susceptible to prediction errors.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce the Signal Jaccard Index (SJI), a novel metric rooted in unsupervised genome context clustering, designed to assess protein similarity. Leveraging SJI, we construct a protein network and reveal that peripheral proteins within the network are the primary contributors to inconsistencies in orthology predictions. Furthermore, we show that a protein's degree centrality in the network serves as a strong predictor of its reliability in consensus sets.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We present an objective, unsupervised SJI-based network encompassing all proteins, in which its topological features elucidate ortholog prediction inconsistencies. The degree centrality (DC) effectively identifies error-prone orthology assignments without relying on arbitrary parameters.

38349131,Reconstructing the transcriptional regulatory network of probiotic <i>L. reuteri</i> is enabled by transcriptomics and machine learning.,"<i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i>, a probiotic microbe instrumental to human health and sustainable food production, adapts to diverse environmental shifts via dynamic gene expression. We applied the independent component analysis (ICA) to 117 RNA-seq data sets to decode its transcriptional regulatory network (TRN), identifying 35 distinct signals that modulate specific gene sets. Our findings indicate that the ICA provides a qualitative advancement and captures nuanced relationships within gene clusters that other methods may miss. This study uncovers the fundamental properties of <i>L. reuteri</i>'s TRN and deepens our understanding of its arginine metabolism and the co-regulation of riboflavin metabolism and fatty acid conversion. It also sheds light on conditions that regulate genes within a specific biosynthetic gene cluster and allows for the speculation of the potential role of isoprenoid biosynthesis in <i>L. reuteri</i>'s adaptive response to environmental changes. By integrating transcriptomics and machine learning, we provide a system-level understanding of <i>L. reuteri</i>'s response mechanism to environmental fluctuations, thus setting the stage for modeling the probiotic transcriptome for applications in microbial food production.<h4>Importance</h4>We have studied <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i>, a beneficial probiotic microbe that plays a significant role in our health and production of sustainable foods, a type of foods that are nutritionally dense and healthier and have low-carbon emissions compared to traditional foods. Similar to how humans adapt their lifestyles to different environments, this microbe adjusts its behavior by modulating the expression of genes. We applied machine learning to analyze large-scale data sets on how these genes behave across diverse conditions. From this, we identified 35 unique patterns demonstrating how <i>L. reuteri</i> adjusts its genes based on 50 unique environmental conditions (such as various sugars, salts, microbial cocultures, human milk, and fruit juice). This research helps us understand better how <i>L. reuteri</i> functions, especially in processes like breaking down certain nutrients and adapting to stressful changes.

Moreover, the specific regulatory machinery remains largely unexplored, mainly due to the inaccessible nature of this complex biological process in humans. Here, we curate and integrate multi-omics data, including 581 RNA-seq, 54 ATAC-seq, 45 ChIP-seq, and 69 single-cell RNA-seq samples from different stages of human PGC development to recapitulate the precisely controlled and stepwise process, presenting an atlas in the human PGC database (hPGCdb). With these uniformly processed data and integrated analyses, we characterize the potential key transcription factors and regulatory networks governing human germ cell fate. We validate the important roles of some of the key factors in germ cell development by CRISPRi knockdown. We also identify the soma-germline interaction network and discover the involvement of SDC2 and LAMA4 for PGC development, as well as soma-derived NOTCH2 signaling for germ cell differentiation.

Unfortunately, HR-IMS and HR-MS measurements are typically performed independently due to mismatches in analysis time scales. Here, we overcome this limitation by using a dual-gated ion injection approach to couple an 11 m path length structures for lossless ion manipulations (SLIM) module to a Q-Exactive Plus Orbitrap MS platform. The dual-gate setup was implemented by placing one ion gate before the SLIM module and a second ion gate after the module. The dual-gated ion injection approach allowed the new SLIM-Orbitrap platform to simultaneously perform an 11 m SLIM separation, Orbitrap mass analysis using the highest selectable mass resolution setting (up to 140 k), and high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) in ∼25 min over an <i>m/z</i> range of ∼1500 amu. The SLIM-Orbitrap platform was initially characterized using a mixture of standard phosphazene cations and demonstrated an average SLIM CCS resolving power (Rp<sup>CCS</sup>) of ∼218 and an SLIM peak capacity of ∼156, while simultaneously obtaining high mass resolutions. SLIM-Orbitrap analysis with fragmentation was then performed on mixtures of standard peptides and two reverse peptides (SDGRG<sup>1+</sup>, GRGDS<sup>1+</sup>, and Rp<sup>CCS</sup> = 305) to demonstrate the utility of combined HR-IMS-MS/MS measurements for peptide identification. Our new HR-IMS-MS/MS capability was further demonstrated by analyzing a complex lipid mixture and showcasing SLIM separations on isobaric lipids.

Shared platforms play a crucial role in facilitating this transformation by offering a variety of scenarios that enable enterprises to make adaptable decisions. This paper develops a capacity sharing model on a shared platform, addressing two scenarios-standardized and differentiated scenarios-the latter incorporating cost discounts. We propose a probability-based adaptive rental strategy (PAS) in the absence of demand distributions. This strategy depicts human psychology and behavior through three steps: designing options, calculating probabilities, and establishing schemes. It differs from direct optimization of decisions by adaptively addressing stochastic problems through options and probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that PAS can balance flexibility and stability across diverse environments, including Poisson, Normal, multimodal, heavy-tailed distributions, and real-world datasets. Furthermore, it achieves near-optimal average profit performance, with improvements attainable through option adjustments.",False,True,,0.64004207,,pas,6.6077428000000005,ok,,,,v2,0.6077428,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

However, recognition based on a single biomarker can induce false positive feedback, including off-target phenomenon caused by the absence of tumor-specific antigens. In addition, nucleic acid probes often cause nonspecific and undesired cell internalization during cell imaging. In this work, we constructed a logic gate DNA nano-platform (LGDP) for single-molecule imaging of cell membrane proteins to synergistically diagnose cancer cells. The traffic light-like color response of LGDP facilitates the precise discrimination among different cell lines. Combined with single molecule technology, the target proteins were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed synergistically.

The traditional search for MCSs within genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) targets cellular growth, identifies reaction sets resulting in a lethal phenotype if disrupted, and retrieves a list of corresponding gene, mRNA, or enzyme targets. Using the dual link between MCSs and Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs), our logic programming-based tool aspefm was able to compute MCSs of any size from GSMMs in acceptable run times. The tool demonstrated better performance when computing large-sized MCSs than the mixed-integer linear programming methods. We applied the new MCSs methodology to a medically-relevant consortium model of two cross-feeding bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. aspefm constraints were used to bias the computation of MCSs toward exchanged metabolites that could complement lethal phenotypes in individual species. We found that interspecies metabolite exchanges could play an essential role in rescuing single-species growth, for instance inosine could complement lethal reaction knock-outs in the purine synthesis, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathways of both bacteria. Finally, MCSs were used to derive a list of promising enzyme targets for consortium-level therapeutic applications that cannot be circumvented via interspecies metabolite exchange.",False,True,,0.6620744,,aspefm,6.60452783,ok,,,,v2,0.60452783,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

This species exhibits significant genetic diversity, potentially impacting its infectivity, disease severity, and antimicrobial resistance. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers comprehensive genetic insights that can be utilized for virulence assessment. However, existing bioinformatic tools for studying Salmonella virulence have notable limitations. To address this gap, a Salmonella Virulence Database with a non-redundant, comprehensive list of putative virulence factors was constructed. Two bioinformatic analysis tools, Virulence Factor Profile Assessment and Virulence Factor Profile Comparison tools, were developed. The former provides data on similarity to the reference genes, e-value, and bite score, while the latter assesses the presence/absence of virulence genes in Salmonella isolates and facilitates comparison of virulence profiles across multiple sequences. To validate the database and associated bioinformatic tools, WGS data from 43,853 Salmonella isolates spanning 14 serovars was extracted from GenBank, and WGS data previously generated in our lab was used. Overall, the Salmonella Virulence database and our bioinformatic tools effectively facilitated virulence assessment, enhancing our understanding of virulence profiles among Salmonella isolates and serovars.

36401161,Protein function annotation based on heterogeneous biological networks.,"<h4>Background</h4>Accurate annotation of protein function is the key to understanding life at the molecular level and has great implications for biomedicine and pharmaceuticals. The rapid developments of high-throughput technologies have generated huge amounts of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, which prompts the emergence of computational methods to determine protein function. Plagued by errors and noises hidden in PPI data, these computational methods have undertaken to focus on the prediction of functions by integrating the topology of protein interaction networks and multi-source biological data. Despite effective improvement of these computational methods, it is still challenging to build a suitable network model for integrating multiplex biological data.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we constructed a heterogeneous biological network by initially integrating original protein interaction networks, protein-domain association data and protein complexes. To prove the effectiveness of the heterogeneous biological network, we applied the propagation algorithm on this network, and proposed a novel iterative model, named Propagate on Heterogeneous Biological Networks (PHN) to score and rank functions in descending order from all functional partners, Finally, we picked out top L of these predicted functions as candidates to annotate the target protein. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrated that PHN outperformed seven other competing approaches using cross-validation. Experimental results indicated that PHN performs significantly better than competing methods and improves the Area Under the Receiver-Operating Curve (AUROC) in Biological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF) and Cellular Components (CC) by no less than 33%, 15% and 28%, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that integrating multi-source data into a heterogeneous biological network can preserve the complex relationship among multiplex biological data and improve the prediction accuracy of protein function by getting rid of the constraints of errors in PPI networks effectively.

40221608,Landslide susceptibility assessment using lightweight dense residual network with emphasis on deep spatial features.,"Landslides are among the geological disasters that frequently occur worldwide and significantly restrict the sustainable development of society. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to perform landslide susceptibility assessment. In addressing issues such as limited training samples, inadequate utilization of spatially effective features, and high computational costs associated with existing methods, we propose a landslide susceptibility assessment method (DS-DRN), which uses a lightweight dense residual network with emphasis on deep spatial features. To minimize computational costs, we design a depthwise separable residual module that optimizes traditional convolution on residual branches into depthwise separable convolution. Additionally, to prevent vanishing gradient and improve the reuse rate of landslide feature information, dense connections are employed to construct a deep feature extraction module. Finally, the output of the model is fed into the Softmax classifier for landslide susceptibility prediction. Taking Ya'an City in Sichuan Province as the study area, we compare the proposed DS-DRN method with three widely used deep learning methods: CNN, CPCNN-RF, and U-net. Evaluating model accuracy and performance, the DS-DRN method exhibits the highest prediction accuracy while also saving computational costs. Therefore, the proposed model can better fit the complex nonlinear relationship in landslide susceptibility, effectively mine deep spatial features, and address the high computational costs associated with complex networks.",False,True,,0.6577424,,ds-drn,6.59113306,ok,,,cnn,v2,0.59113306,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In this work, we propose a dictionary-based matching graph network for BioNER. This approach utilizes the matching graph method to project all possible dictionary-based entity combinations in the text onto a directional graph. The network is implemented coherently with a bi-directional graph convolutional network (BiGCN) that incorporates the matching graph information. Our proposed approach fully leverages the dictionary-based matching graph instead of a simple masked manner. We have conducted numerous experiments on five typical Bio-NER datasets.

GIs typically occur sporadically among related bacterial strains, enabling comparative genomic approaches to GI identification. For a candidate GI in a query genome, the number of reference genomes with a precise deletion of the GI serves as a support value for the GI. Our comparative software for GI identification was slowed by our original use of large reference genome databases (DBs). Here we explore smaller species-focused DBs.<h4>Results</h4>With increasing DB size, recovery of our reliable prophage GI calls reached a plateau, while recovery of less reliable GI calls (FPs) increased rapidly as DB sizes exceeded ~500 genomes; i.e., overlarge DBs can increase FP rates. Paradoxically, relative to prophages, FPs were both more frequently supported only by genomes outside the species and more frequently supported only by genomes inside the species; this may be due to their generally lower support values. Setting a DB size limit for our SMAll Ranked Tailored (SMART) DB design speeded runtime ~65-fold. Strictly intra-species DBs would tend to lower yields of prophages for small species (with few genomes available); simulations with large species showed that this could be partially overcome by reaching outside the species to closely related taxa, without an FP burden. Employing such taxonomic outreach in DB design generated redundancy in the DB set; as few as 2984 DBs were needed to cover all 47894 prokaryotic species.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Runtime decreased dramatically with SMART DB design, with only minor losses of prophages.

However, current platforms with transcription and translation regulators have a limited number of detectable molecules to induce gene expression. Here to address these issues, we present a Target-dependent RNA polymerase (TdRNAP) that can induce RNA transcription in response to the intracellular target specifically recognized by single antibody. By substituting the fused antibody, we demonstrate that TdRNAPs respond to a wide variety of molecules, including peptides, proteins, RNA, and small molecules, and produce desired transcripts in human cells. Furthermore, we show that multiple TdRNAPs can construct orthogonal and multilayer genetic circuits. Finally, we apply TdRNAP to achieve cell-specific genome editing that is autonomously triggered by detecting the target gene product.

Few techniques to accomplish that goal have been offered in recent years but all in the near-IR region. In this paper, we report a design for realizing a highly efficient CT reduction in the MIR regime, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. The reported structure is based on the silicon-on-calcium-fluoride (SOCF) platform with uniform Ge/Si strip arrays. Using Ge strips shows better CT reduction and longer coupling length (L<sub>c</sub>) than the conventional Si based devices over a wide bandwidth in the MIR region. The effect of adding a different number of Ge and Si strips with different dimensions between two adjacent Si waveguides on the L<sub>c</sub> and hence on the CT is analyzed using both full vectorial finite element method and 3D finite difference time domain method. An increase in the L<sub>c</sub> by 4 orders of magnitude and 6.5 times are obtained using Ge and Si strips, respectively, compared to strips-free Si waveguides. Consequently, crosstalk suppression of - 35 dB and - 10 dB for the Ge and Si strips, respectively, is shown.

38650009,Identification of osteoporosis ferroptosis-related markers and potential therapeutic compounds based on bioinformatics methods and molecular docking technology.,"<h4>Research background and purpose</h4>Osteoporosis (OP) is one of the most common bone diseases worldwide, characterized by low bone mineral density and susceptibility to pathological fractures, especially in postmenopausal women and elderly men. Ferroptosis is one of the newly discovered forms of cell death regulated by genes in recent years. Many studies have shown that ferroptosis is closely related to many diseases. However, there are few studies on ferroptosis in osteoporosis, and the mechanism of ferroptosis in osteoporosis is still unclear. This study aims to identify biomarkers related to osteoporosis ferroptosis from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database through bioinformatics technology, and to mine potential therapeutic small molecule compounds through molecular docking technology, trying to provide a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in the future.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We downloaded the ferroptosis-related gene set from the FerrDb database ( http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/index.html ), downloaded the data sets GSE56815 and GSE7429 from the GEO database, and used the R software ""limma"" package to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from GSE56815, and intersected with the ferroptosis gene set to obtain ferroptosis-related DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were performed by the R software ""clusterProfiler"" package. The random forest model was further screened to obtain essential ferroptosis genes. R software ""corrplot"" package was used for correlation analysis of essential ferroptosis genes, and the Wilcox test was used for significance analysis. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network was constructed using Cytoscape software. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to construct a disease diagnosis model, and a Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the diagnostic performance, and then GSE7429 was used to verify the reliability of the diagnosis model. Molecular docking technology was used to screen potential small molecule compounds from the Drugbank database. Finally, a rat osteoporosis model was constructed, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted for qRT-PCR detection to verify the mRNA expression levels of crucial ferroptosis genes.<h4>Result</h4>Six DEGs related to ferroptosis were initially screened out. GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that ferroptosis-related DEGs were mainly enriched in signaling pathways such as maintenance of iron ion homeostasis, copper ion binding function, and ferroptosis. The random forest model identified five key ferroptosis genes, including CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1, and SLC2A3. Gene correlation analysis found a relatively low correlation between these five key ferroptosis genes. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network shows that BAZ1B and STAT3 may also be potential molecules. The ROC curve of the disease diagnosis model shows that the model has a good diagnostic performance. Molecular docking technology screened out three small molecule compounds, including NADH, Midostaurin, and Nintedanib small molecule compounds. qRT-PCR detection confirmed the differential expression of CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1 and SLC2A3 between OP and normal control group.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study identified five key ferroptosis genes (CP, FLT3, HAMP, HMOX1, and SLC2A3), they were most likely related to OP ferroptosis. In addition, we found that the small molecule compounds of NADH, Midostaurin, and Nintedanib had good docking scores with these five key ferroptosis genes.

35143846,How the resource supply distribution structures competitive communities.,"Competition is a pervasive interaction known to structure ecological communities. The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model has been foundational for our understanding of competition, and trait-based LV models have been used to model community assembly and eco-evolutionary phenomena like diversification. The intrinsic growth rate function is determined by the underlying resource distribution and is a key determinant of the resulting diversity, traits and abundances of species. In these models, the width of the resource distribution relative to the width of the competition kernel has been identified as a key parameter that leads to diversification. However, studies have only investigated the impact of width at just a few discrete values, while also often assuming the intrinsic growth rate function to be unimodal. Thus, the impact of the underlying resource distribution's width and shape together remains incompletely explored, particularly for large, diverse communities. In this study, we vary its width continuously for two shapes (unimodal and bimodal) to explore its impact on community structure. When the resource distribution is very narrow in both the unimodal bimodal cases, competition is strong, leading to exclusion of all but the best-adapted species. Wider resource distributions allow stable coexistence, where the traits of the species depend on the shape of the resource distribution. Extremely wide resource distributions support a diverse community, where the strength of competition ultimately determines the diversity and traits of coexisting species, but their abundances reflect the underlying resource distribution. Further, competition acts to maximize the use of available resources among the competing species. For large communities, the shape of resource distribution becomes immaterial and the width determines the diversity. These results affirm and extend our understanding of limiting similarity.",False,True,,0.6230278,lotka-volterra,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37667031,Sentence-level sentiment analysis based on supervised gradual machine learning.,"Sentence-level sentiment analysis (SLSA) aims to identify the overall sentiment polarity conveyed in a given sentence.

However, depending on the i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) assumption, the performance of these deep learning models may fall short in real scenarios, where the distributions of training and target data are almost certainly different to some extent. In this paper, we propose a supervised solution based on the non-i.i.d paradigm of gradual machine learning (GML) for SLSA. It begins with some labeled observations, and gradually labels target instances in the order of increasing hardness by iterative knowledge conveyance. It leverages labeled samples for supervised deep feature extraction, and constructs a factor graph based on the extracted features to enable gradual knowledge conveyance. Specifically, it employs a polarity classifier to detect polarity similarity between close neighbors in an embedding space, and a separate binary semantic network to extract implicit polarity relations between arbitrary instances. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all benchmark datasets.

As a result, an efficient scheduling mechanism is required to determine the order of handling application requests, as well as the appropriate use of a broadcast media and data transfer. In this paper an innovative approach, incorporating the Crossover and Mutation (CM)-centered Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) is introduced for an effective resource allocation. This strategic resource allocation optimally schedules resources within the Vehicular Edge computing (VEC) network, ensuring the most efficient utilization. The proposed method begins by the meticulous feature extraction from the Vehicular network model, with attributes such as mobility patterns, transmission medium, bandwidth, storage capacity, and packet delivery ratio. For further analysis the Elephant Herding Lion Optimizer (EHLO) algorithm is employed to pinpoint the most critical attributes. Subsequently the Modified Fuzzy C-Means (MFCM) algorithm is used for efficient vehicle clustering centred on selected attributes. These clustered vehicle characteristics are then transferred and stored within the cloud server infrastructure. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using MATLAB software using simulation method.

While assessing stable interactions is more straightforward, capturing transient ones is challenging. In recent years, sophisticated tools have emerged to improve transient interactor discovery, with many harnessing the power of evolved biotin ligases for proximity labelling. However, biotinylation-based methods have lagged behind in the model eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, possibly due to the presence of several abundant, endogenously biotinylated proteins. In this study, we optimised robust biotin-ligation methodologies in yeast and increased their sensitivity by creating a bespoke technique for downregulating endogenous biotinylation, which we term ABOLISH (Auxin-induced BiOtin LIgase diminiSHing). We used the endoplasmic reticulum insertase complex (EMC) to demonstrate our approaches and uncover new substrates. To make these tools available for systematic probing of both stable and transient interactions, we generated five full-genome collections of strains in which every yeast protein is tagged with each of the tested biotinylation machineries, some on the background of the ABOLISH system.

However, the hardware simplicity provided by the lensless configuration is often offset by the demanding computational postprocessing required to match the retrieved sample information to the user's expectations. A promising avenue to simplify this stage is the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) solutions into the DLHM workflow. The biggest challenge to do so is the preparation of an extensive and high-quality experimental dataset of curated DLHM recordings to train ML models. In this work, a diverse, open-access dataset of DLHM recordings is presented as support for future research, contributing to the data needs of the applied research community. The database comprises 11,760 experimental DLHM holograms of bio and non-bio samples with diversity on the main recording parameters of the DLHM architecture.

Detecting these genes in disease-causing organisms is critical for various biological studies, including understanding microbe metabolism, engineering genetically modified microorganisms, and identifying targets for treatment. When essential genes are expressed, they give rise to essential proteins. Identifying these genes, especially in complex organisms like Plasmodium falciparum, which causes malaria, is challenging due to the cost and time associated with experimental methods. Thus, computational approaches have emerged. Early research in this area prioritised the study of less intricate organisms, inadvertently neglecting the complexities of metabolite transport in metabolic networks. To overcome this, a Network-based Machine Learning framework was proposed. It assessed various network properties in Plasmodium falciparum, using a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (iAM_Pf480) from the BiGG database and essentiality data from the Ogee database. The proposed approach substantially improved gene essentiality predictions as it considered the weighted and directed nature of metabolic networks and utilised network-based features, achieving a high accuracy rate of 0.85 and an AuROC of 0.7. Furthermore, this study enhanced the understanding of metabolic networks and their role in determining gene essentiality in Plasmodium falciparum.

Extremophiles, which thrive in harsh conditions such as high salinity, extreme temperatures, and acidic or alkaline environments, produce enzymes naturally adapted to function under these conditions. This unique adaptability makes them highly desirable for industrial processes requiring robust and efficient biocatalysts. These biocatalysts reduce reliance on harsh chemicals and energy-intensive processes, contributing to greener industrial operations. This review underscores the power of metagenomics in bypassing the need to culture large libraries of extremophiles in the lab. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics enable the identification of novel GH-encoding genes directly from environmental DNA. While metagenomic mining has yielded promising results, challenges such as the expression of extremophile-derived genes in mesophilic hosts, low activity yields, and scalability remain.

In response to these challenges, this study explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the detection and classification of human parasite eggs through the YOLOv4 deep learning object detection algorithm.<h4>Methods</h4>Eggs from species such as <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> (<i>A</i>. <i>lumbricoides</i>), <i>Trichuris trichiura</i> (<i>T</i>. <i>trichiura</i>), <i>Enterobius vermicularis</i> (<i>E</i>. <i>vermicularis</i>), <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i> (<i>A</i>. <i>duodenale</i>), <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i> (<i>S</i>. <i>japonicum</i>), <i>Paragonimus westermani</i> (<i>P</i>. <i>westermani</i>), <i>Fasciolopsis buski</i> (<i>F</i>. <i>buski</i>), <i>Clonorchis sinensis</i> (<i>C</i>. <i>sinensis</i>), and <i>Taenia</i> spp. (<i>T</i>. <i>spp</i>.) were collected and prepared as both single species and mixed egg smears. These samples were photographed under a light microscope and analyzed using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) v4 model.<h4>Results</h4>The model demonstrated high recognition accuracy, achieving 100% for <i>Clonorchis sinensis</i> and <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>, with slightly lower accuracies for other species such as <i>E</i>. <i>vermicularis</i> (89.31%), <i>F</i>. <i>buski</i> (88.00%), and T. trichiura (84.85%). For mixed helminth eggs, the recognition accuracy rates arrived at Group 1 (98.10, 95.61%), Group 2 (94.86, 93.28 and 91.43%), and Group 3 (93.34 and 75.00%), indicating the platform's robustness but also highlighting areas for improvement in complex diagnostic scenarios.<h4>Discussion</h4>The results show that this AI-assisted platform significantly reduces reliance on professional expertise while maintaining real-time efficiency and high accuracy, offering a powerful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of parasitosis. With further optimization, such as expanding training datasets and refining recognition algorithms, this AI system could become a key resource in both clinical and public health efforts to combat parasitic infections.",False,True,,0.60755754,you only look once,yolov4 | yolo,6.0,conflict,yolo | you only look once,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37946302,A genome catalog of the early-life human skin microbiome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Metagenome-assembled genomes have greatly expanded the reference genomes for skin microbiome. However, the current reference genomes are largely based on samples from adults in North America and lack representation from infants and individuals from other continents.<h4>Results</h4>Here we use deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile the skin microbiota of 215 infants at age 2-3 months and 12 months who are part of the VITALITY trial in Australia as well as 67 maternally matched samples. Based on the infant samples, we present the Early-Life Skin Genomes (ELSG) catalog, comprising 9483 prokaryotic genomes from 1056 species, 206 fungal genomes from 13 species, and 39 eukaryotic viral sequences. This genome catalog substantially expands the diversity of species previously known to comprise human skin microbiome and improves the classification rate of sequenced data by 21%. The protein catalog derived from these genomes provides insights into the functional elements such as defense mechanisms that distinguish early-life skin microbiome. We also find evidence for microbial sharing at the community, bacterial species, and strain levels between mothers and infants.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, the ELSG catalog uncovers the skin microbiome of a previously underrepresented age group and population and provides a comprehensive view of human skin microbiome diversity, function, and development in early life.",False,True,,0.66326034,early-life skin genomes,elsg,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37356495,An Atlas of the Knee Joint Proteins and Their Role in Osteoarthritis Defined by Literature Mining.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent rheumatic pathology. However, OA is not simply a process of wear and tear affecting articular cartilage but rather a disease of the entire joint. One of the most common locations of OA is the knee. Knee tissues have been studied using molecular strategies, generating a large amount of complex data. As one of the goals of the Rheumatic and Autoimmune Diseases initiative of the Human Proteome Project, we applied a text-mining strategy to publicly available literature to collect relevant information and generate a systematically organized overview of the proteins most closely related to the different knee components. To this end, the PubPular literature-mining software was employed to identify protein-topic relationships and extract the most frequently cited proteins associated with the different knee joint components and OA. The text-mining approach searched over eight million articles in PubMed up to November 2022. Proteins associated with the six most representative knee components (articular cartilage, subchondral bone, synovial membrane, synovial fluid, meniscus, and cruciate ligament) were retrieved and ranked by their relevance to the tissue and OA. Gene ontology analyses showed the biological functions of these proteins. This study provided a systematic and prioritized description of knee-component proteins most frequently cited as associated with OA. The study also explored the relationship of these proteins to OA and identified the processes most relevant to proper knee function and OA pathophysiology.",False,True,,0.64964217,rheumatic and autoimmune diseases | pubpular,,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Although recent metagenomic studies have expanded our understanding of the community and function of seep microorganisms, knowledge of the diversity and genetic repertoire of global seep microbes is lacking. Here, we collected a compilation of 165 metagenomic datasets from 16 cold seep sites across the globe to construct a comprehensive gene and genome catalog. The non-redundant gene catalog comprised 147 million genes, and 36% of them could not be assigned to a function with the currently available databases. A total of 3,164 species-level representative metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were obtained, most of which (94%) belonged to novel species. Of them, 81 ANME species were identified that cover all subclades except ANME-2d, and 23 syntrophic SRB species spanned the Seep-SRB1a, Seep-SRB1g, and Seep-SRB2 clades.

39994432,Machine learning-enabled multiscale modeling platform for damage sensing digital twin in piezoelectric composite structures.,"Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of aerospace structures plays a crucial role in their successful operation under harsh environments. Most NDE methods, however, lack real-time in-situ predictive capabilities of evolving damage and are conducted in a post-mortem manner. This paper proposes a damage-sensing digital twin (DT) for piezoelectric composite structures incorporating microscale morphology and mechanisms into structural damage to address this shortcoming. The DT framework consists of a two-step computational process integrating multiscale-multiphysics modeling with machine learning (ML) tools to detect damage progression in the piezoelectric composite structure using electrical signal measurements at a few surface points. A parametrically upscaled coupled constitutive damage mechanics (PUCCDM) model is developed for this DT with the representation of microstructural morphology and mechanisms in macroscopic constitutive relations. Artificial neural network operates on micro-electro-mechanical data to derive PUCCDM constitutive coefficients as functions of underlying representative aggregated microstructural parameters (RAMPs). The PUCCDM model-simulated macroscopic electromechanical and damage fields, in conjunction with RAMPs, provide a comprehensive time-dependent dataset for a convolutional long-short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network to learn microstructure-dependent electrical and damage field correlations. The DT is consequently used to successfully predict location-specific damage from electrical signals at a limited number of sensors.",False,True,,0.6890289,convlstm,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39519363,"An Accurate and Efficient Approach to Knowledge Extraction from Scientific Publications Using Structured Ontology Models, Graph Neural Networks, and Large Language Models.","The rapid growth of biomedical literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current. Integrating knowledge from various sources is crucial for studying complex biological systems. Traditional text-mining methods often have limited accuracy because they don't capture semantic and contextual nuances. Deep-learning models can be computationally expensive and typically have low interpretability, though efforts in explainable AI aim to mitigate this. Furthermore, transformer-based models have a tendency to produce false or made-up information-a problem known as hallucination-which is especially prevalent in large language models (LLMs). This study proposes a hybrid approach combining text-mining techniques with graph neural networks (GNNs) and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to extend biomedical knowledge graphs and interpret predicted edges based on published literature. An LLM is used to validate predictions and provide explanations. Evaluated on a corpus of experimentally confirmed protein interactions, the approach achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.772. Applied to insomnia, the approach identified 25 interactions between 32 human proteins absent in known knowledge bases, including regulatory interactions between MAOA and 5-HT2C, binding between ADAM22 and 14-3-3 proteins, which is implicated in neurological diseases, and a circadian regulatory loop involving RORB and NR1D1.

36406450,Application of ecosystem-specific reference databases for increased taxonomic resolution in soil microbial profiling.,"Intensive agriculture systems have paved the way for a growing human population. However, the abundant use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides may negatively impact nutrient cycles and biodiversity. One potential alternative is to harness beneficial relationships between plants and plant-associated rhizobacteria to increase nutrient-use efficiency and provide pathogen resistance. Plant-associated microbiota profiling can be achieved using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, interrogation of these data is limited by confident taxonomic classifications at high taxonomic resolution (genus- or species level) with the commonly applied universal reference databases. High-throughput full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with automated taxonomy assignment (AutoTax) can be used to create amplicon sequence variant resolved ecosystems-specific reference databases that are superior to the traditional universal reference databases. This approach was used here to create a custom reference database for bacteria and archaea based on 987,353 full-length 16S rRNA genes from Askov and Cologne soils. We evaluated the performance of the database using short-read amplicon data and found that it resulted in the increased genus- and species-level classification compared to commonly use universal reference databases. The custom database was utilized to evaluate the ecosystem-specific primer bias and taxonomic resolution of amplicon primers targeting the V5-V7 region of the 16S rRNA gene commonly used within the plant microbiome field. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of custom ecosystem-specific databases through the analysis of V5-V7 amplicon data to identify new plant-associated microbes for two legumes and two cereal species.",False,True,,0.65529764,autotax,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

This study estimates China's onshore and offshore CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage potential and injection rate capacity with a fine resolution of 5 km covering 24 major sedimentary basins and 1181 oilfields. Using ArcGIS along with statistical tools, we produce five datasets at the grid level, four at the county level, and four at the provincial level.

37340506,A comparison of approaches to accessing existing biological and chemical relational databases via SPARQL.,"Current biological and chemical research is increasingly dependent on the reusability of previously acquired data, which typically come from various sources. Consequently, there is a growing need for database systems and databases stored in them to be interoperable with each other. One of the possible solutions to address this issue is to use systems based on Semantic Web technologies, namely on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to express data and on the SPARQL query language to retrieve the data. Many existing biological and chemical databases are stored in the form of a relational database (RDB). Converting a relational database into the RDF form and storing it in a native RDF database system may not be desirable in many cases. It may be necessary to preserve the original database form, and having two versions of the same data may not be convenient. A solution may be to use a system mapping the relational database to the RDF form. Such a system keeps data in their original relational form and translates incoming SPARQL queries to equivalent SQL queries, which are evaluated by a relational-database system. This review compares different RDB-to-RDF mapping systems with a primary focus on those that can be used free of charge. In addition, it compares different approaches to expressing RDB-to-RDF mappings. The review shows that these systems represent a viable method providing sufficient performance.

Single-cell RNA sequencing of 13,200 cells reveals that ventral nerve cord MNs cluster into 29 molecularly distinct subclasses. Extending C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map and Network (CeNGEN) findings, all MN subclasses are delineated by distinct expression codes of either neuropeptide or transcription factor gene families. Strikingly, combinatorial codes of homeodomain transcription factor genes succinctly delineate adult MN diversity in both C. elegans and mice.

In the field of lymphomas, ctDNA-based blood tests represent the forefront of clinically applicable tools to harness decades of genomic research for disease profiling, quantification, and detection. More recently, the discovery of nonrandom fragmentation patterns in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has opened another avenue of liquid biopsy research beyond mutational interrogation of ctDNA. Through examination of structural features, nucleotide content, and genomic distribution of massive numbers of plasma cfDNA molecules, the study of fragmentomics aims at identifying new tools that augment existing ctDNA-based analyses and discover new ways to profile cancer from blood tests. Indeed, the characterization of aberrant lymphoma ctDNA fragment patterns and harnessing them with powerful machine-learning techniques are expected to unleash the potential of nonmutant molecules for liquid biopsy purposes. In this article, we review cfDNA fragmentomics as an emerging approach in the ctDNA research of B-cell lymphomas. We summarize the biology behind the formation of cfDNA fragment patterns and discuss the preanalytical and technical limitations faced with current methodologies. Then we go through the advances in the field of lymphomas and envision what other noninvasive tools based on fragment characteristics could be explored. Last, we place fragmentomics as one of the facets of ctDNA analyses in emerging multiview and multiomics liquid biopsies.

37422490,A fuzzy logic-based secure hierarchical routing scheme using firefly algorithm in Internet of Things for healthcare.,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a universal network to supervise the physical world through sensors installed on different devices. The network can improve many areas, including healthcare because IoT technology has the potential to reduce pressure caused by aging and chronic diseases on healthcare systems. For this reason, researchers attempt to solve the challenges of this technology in healthcare. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based secure hierarchical routing scheme using the firefly algorithm (FSRF) is presented for IoT-based healthcare systems. FSRF comprises three main frameworks: fuzzy trust framework, firefly algorithm-based clustering framework, and inter-cluster routing framework. A fuzzy logic-based trust framework is responsible for evaluating the trust of IoT devices on the network. This framework identifies and prevents routing attacks like black hole, flooding, wormhole, sinkhole, and selective forwarding. Moreover, FSRF supports a clustering framework based on the firefly algorithm. It presents a fitness function that evaluates the chance of IoT devices to be cluster head nodes. The design of this function is based on trust level, residual energy, hop count, communication radius, and centrality. Also, FSRF involves an on-demand routing framework to decide on reliable and energy-efficient paths that can send the data to the destination faster. Finally, FSRF is compared to the energy-efficient multi-level secure routing protocol (EEMSR) and the enhanced balanced energy-efficient network-integrated super heterogeneous (E-BEENISH) routing method based on network lifetime, energy stored in IoT devices, and packet delivery rate (PDR). These results prove that FSRF improves network longevity by 10.34% and 56.35% and the energy stored in the nodes by 10.79% and 28.51% compared to EEMSR and E-BEENISH, respectively. However, FSRF is weaker than EEMSR in terms of security.

This is a particular issue when metabarcoding complex communities such as wildlife parasites or terrestrial and aquatic free-living nematode communities. We have used markerDB to produce four databases of distinct regions of the rRNA cistron: the 18S rRNA gene, the 28S rRNA gene, the ITS-1 intergenic spacer and the region spanning ITS-1_5.8S_ITS-2. These databases comprise 2645, 254, 13,461 and 10,107 unique full-length sequences representing 1391, 204, 1837 and 1322 nematode species, respectively. The comparative analysis illustrates the complementary value but also reveals a better representation of Clade III, IV and V than Clade I and Clade II nematodes in each case. Although the ITS-1 database includes the largest number of unique full-length sequences, the 18S rRNA database provides the widest taxonomic coverage. We also developed PrimerTC, a tool to assess primer sequence conservation across any reference sequence database, and have applied it to evaluate a large number of previously published rRNA cistron primers. We identified sets of primers that currently provide the broadest taxonomic coverage for each rRNA marker across the nematode phylum.

There are an enormous number of different LBDs that recognize a similarly diverse set of signals. To give a global perspective of the signals that interact with transcriptional regulators, sensor kinases and chemoreceptors, we manually retrieved information on the protein-ligand interaction from about 1,200 publications and 3D structures. The resulting 811 proteins were classified according to the Pfam family into 127 groups. These data permit a delineation of the signal profiles of individual LBD families as well as distinguishing between families that recognize signals in a promiscuous manner and those that possess a well-defined ligand range.

37258857,Metagenomics Databases for Bacteria.,"The booming sequencing technologies have turned metagenomics into a widely used tool for microbe-related studies, especially in the areas of clinical medicine and ecology. Accordingly, the toolkit of metagenomics data analysis is growing stronger to provide multiple approaches for solving various biological questions and understanding the component and function of microbiome. As part of the toolkit, metagenomics databases play a central role in the creation and maintenance of processed data such as definition of taxonomic classifications, annotation of gene functions, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic tree inference. The availability of a large quantity of high-quality bacterial genomic sequences contributes significantly to the construction and update of metagenomics databases, which constitute the core resource for metagenomics data analysis at various scales.

The main condition for the event sequence is a sequential increase in the conditional probability of two-itemset rules having positive certainty factor, when they are studied together.A clinical event in our framework is defined to be a collection of several blocks of events that meet the aforementioned condition, when considered together. The correctness of our clinical sequences has been validated by two physicians.<h4>Results</h4>Our results showed that medical experts scored the rules of this algorithm better than random Apriori rules. A GUI was designed that can be used to examine the association of each clinical event with the clinical outcomes of the length of stay, inpatient mortality, and hospital charges.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present work provides a new approach on how we can improve extraction of clinical event sequences automatically, without user annotation.

37160609,Knockout mouse models as a resource for the study of rare diseases.,"Rare diseases (RDs) are a challenge for medicine due to their heterogeneous clinical manifestations and low prevalence. There is a lack of specific treatments and only a few hundred of the approximately 7,000 RDs have an approved regime. Rapid technological development in genome sequencing enables the mass identification of potential candidates that in their mutated form could trigger diseases but are often not confirmed to be causal. Knockout (KO) mouse models are essential to understand the causality of genes by allowing highly standardized research into the pathogenesis of diseases. The German Mouse Clinic (GMC) is one of the pioneers in mouse research and successfully uses (preclinical) data obtained from single-gene KO mutants for research into monogenic RDs. As part of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) and INFRAFRONTIER, the pan-European consortium for modeling human diseases, the GMC expands these preclinical data toward global collaborative approaches with researchers, clinicians, and patient groups.Here, we highlight proprietary genes that when deleted mimic clinical phenotypes associated with known RD targets (Nacc1, Bach2, Klotho alpha). We focus on recognized RD genes with no pre-existing KO mouse models (Kansl1l, Acsf3, Pcdhgb2, Rabgap1, Cox7a2) which highlight novel phenotypes capable of optimizing clinical diagnosis. In addition, we present genes with intriguing phenotypic data (Zdhhc5, Wsb2) that are not presently associated with known human RDs.This report provides comprehensive evidence for genes that when deleted cause differences in the KO mouse across multiple organs, providing a huge translational potential for further understanding monogenic RDs and their clinical spectrum.

The advent of high-throughput sequencing has led to the production of ""big data"", which has also affected the field of virology.

In this article, which is the first in a series on how bioinformatics can enhance virus research, we show that highly useful information is retrievable from selected general and dedicated databases. Indeed, an enormous amount of information-both in terms of nucleotide/protein sequences and their annotation-is deposited in the general databases of international organisations participating in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). However, more and more virus-specific databases have been established and are progressively enriched with the contents and features reported in this article. Since viruses are intracellular obligate parasites, a special focus is given to host-pathogen protein-protein interaction databases. Finally, we illustrate several phylogenetic and phylodynamic tools, combining information on algorithms and features with practical information on how to use them and case studies that validate their usefulness.

Toward this goal, we here describe the creation of a curated database of experimentally determined human protein structures. Starting with the sequences of 20,422 human proteins, we selected the most representative structure for each protein (if available) from the protein database (PDB), ranking structures by coverage of sequence by structure, depth (the difference between the final and initial residue number of each chain), resolution, and experimental method used to determine the structure. To enable expansion into an entire human targetome, we docked small molecule ligands to our curated set of protein structures. Using design constraints derived from comparing structure assembly and ligand docking results obtained with challenging protein examples, we here propose to combine this curated database of experimental structures with AlphaFold predictions and multi-domain assembly using DEMO2 in the future. To demonstrate the utility of our curated database in identification of the human protein structure targetome, we used docking with AutoDock Vina and created tools for automated analysis of affinity and binding site locations of the thousands of protein-ligand prediction results. The resulting human targetome, which can be updated and expanded with an evolving curated database and increasing numbers of ligands, is a valuable addition to the growing toolkit of structural bioinformatics.",False,True,,0.72319275,alphafold | autodock,pdb,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

However, these require trial- and -error design process and complex experimental environment to generate heterostructure materials. Here, this study describes an easy-to-execute strategy to fabricate magnetic heterostructure as multifunctional delivery system. We utilize first-row transition metal copper and nitroso/amino ligand as modules to assemble around Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles by excessed mild stimuli and fabricate the magnetic heterostructure materials (Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> @ TACN NPs (tetraamminecopper (II) nitrate)). Notably, the Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> @ TACN NPs present with cat's-whisker structure containing ligand and metal center. The nitroso-group ligands exhibit strong binding affinity to heme-structure enzyme, ensuring effective capture and isolate of cytochrome C (Cyt-c), resulting in their excellent isolation property. The copper complex-powered magnetic heterostructure materials can effectively isolation Cyt-c from complex biological sample (pork heart). Importantly, the Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> @ TACN NPs coordinated with heme-structure, induced methionine 80 (Met80) disassociates from heme prosthetic group, and contributed to peroxidase-like (POD-like) activities increasing.

36833209,A Network-Based Approach for Improving Annotation of Transcription Factor Functions and Binding Sites in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.,"Transcription factors are an integral component of the cellular machinery responsible for regulating many biological processes, and they recognize distinct DNA sequence patterns as well as internal/external signals to mediate target gene expression. The functional roles of an individual transcription factor can be traced back to the functions of its target genes. While such functional associations can be inferred through the use of binding evidence from high-throughput sequencing technologies available today, including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, such experiments can be resource-consuming. On the other hand, exploratory analysis driven by computational techniques can alleviate this burden by narrowing the search scope, but the results are often deemed low-quality or non-specific by biologists. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven, statistics-based strategy to predict novel functional associations for transcription factors in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. To achieve this, we leverage one of the largest available gene expression compendia to build a genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network and infer regulatory relationships among transcription factors and their targets. We then use this network to build a pool of likely downstream targets for each transcription factor and query each target pool for functionally enriched gene ontology terms. The results exhibited sufficient statistical significance to annotate most of the transcription factors in Arabidopsis with highly specific biological processes. We also perform DNA binding motif discovery for transcription factors based on their target pool. We show that the predicted functions and motifs strongly agree with curated databases constructed from experimental evidence. In addition, statistical analysis of the network revealed interesting patterns and connections between network topology and system-level transcriptional regulation properties.

38733902,Database construction and comparative genomics analysis of genes involved in nutritional metabolic diseases in fish.,"Nutritional metabolic diseases in fish frequently arise in the setting of intensive aquaculture. The etiology and pathogenesis of these conditions involve energy metabolic disorders influenced by both internal genetic factors and external environmental conditions. The exploration of genes associated with nutritional and metabolic disorder has sparked considerable interest within both the aquaculture scientific community and the industry. High-throughput sequencing technology offers researchers extensive genetic information. Effectively mining, analyzing, and securely storing this data is crucial, especially for advancing disease prevention and treatment strategies. Presently, the exploration and application of gene databases concerning nutritional and metabolic disorders in fish are at a nascent stag. Therefore, this study focused on the model organism zebrafish and five primary economic fish species as the subjects of investigation. Using information from KEGG, OMIM, and existing literature, a novel gene database associated with nutritional metabolic diseases in fish was meticulously constructed. This database encompassed 4583 genes for Danio rerio, 6287 for Cyprinus carpio, 3289 for Takifugu rubripes, 3548 for Larimichthys crocea, 3816 for Oreochromis niloticus, and 5708 for Oncorhynchus mykiss. Through a comparative systems biology approach, we discerned a relatively high conservation of genes linked to nutritional metabolic diseases across these fish species, with over 54.9 % of genes being conserved throughout all six species. Additionally, the analysis pinpointed the existence of 13 species-specific genes within the genomes of large yellow croaker, tilapia, and rainbow trout.

38635816,An efficient and compromise-resilient image encryption scheme for resource-constrained environments.,"The secret keys produced by current image cryptosystems, which rely on chaotic sequences, exhibit a direct correlation with the size of the image. As the image dimensions expand, the generation of extensive chaotic sequences in the encryption and decryption procedures becomes more computationally intensive. Secondly, a common problem in existing image encryption schemes is the compromise between privacy and efficiency. Some existing lightweight schemes reveal patterns in encrypted images, while others impose heavy computational burdens during encryption/decryption due to the need for large chaotic sequences. In this study, we introduce a lightweight image encryption scheme that involves partitioning the image into uniformly sized tiles and generating a chaotic sequence accordingly. This approach diminishes the necessity to create extensive chaotic sequences equal to the tile size, which is significantly smaller than the original image. As a result, it alleviates the processing burden associated with generating sequences equivalent to the original image size. The results confirm that our proposed scheme is lightweight and secure compared to the latest state-of-the-art image encryption schemes.

This has worsened over the past five years and, as a result, libraries and other institutional spaces have been repeatedly vandalised, with hundreds of records, specimens and historical data stolen, destroyed or burned. To avoid the loss of irreplaceable data on Venezuelan biodiversity, an initiative was promoted, aimed at digitising information to create a rich dataset of biodiversity records, with emphasis on marine protected areas for the country, as well as to fill gaps in the distribution and status of marine biodiversity in Venezuela. Nighteen (19) institutions in the country focusing on marine science have consistently produced a wealth of information about Venezuela's marine biodiversity in the form of specimen collections, unpublished sampled data and research theses through the work of hundreds of researchers and students. An inventory of available data sources at these national institutions was conducted under the National Biodiversity Data Mobilization Grant and the Biodiversity Information for Development Program, together with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) support.

36555185,<i>Escherichia coli</i> as a New Platform for the Fast Production of Vault-like Nanoparticles: An Optimized Protocol.,"Vaults are protein nanoparticles that are found in almost all eukaryotic cells but are absent in prokaryotic ones. Due to their properties (nanometric size, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and lack of immunogenicity), vaults show enormous potential as a bio-inspired, self-assembled drug-delivery system (DDS). Vault architecture is directed by self-assembly of the ""major vault protein"" (MVP), the main component of this nanoparticle. Recombinant expression (in different eukaryotic systems) of the MVP resulted in the formation of nanoparticles that were indistinguishable from native vaults. Nowadays, recombinant vaults for different applications are routinely produced in insect cells and purified by successive ultracentrifugations, which are both tedious and time-consuming strategies. To offer cost-efficient and faster protocols for nanoparticle production, we propose the production of vault-like nanoparticles in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells, which are still one of the most widely used prokaryotic cell factories for recombinant protein production. The strategy proposed allowed for the spontaneous encapsulation of the engineered cargo protein within the self-assembled vault-like nanoparticles by simply mixing the clarified lysates of the producing cells.

However, there are challenges not only in growing crystals in microfluidic droplets, but also in delivering the droplets into X-ray beams, including the physical arrangement, beamline and timing constraints and ease of use. Here, the crystallization of two human gut microbial hydrolases in microfluidic droplets is described: a sample-transport and data-collection approach that is inexpensive, is convenient, requires small amounts of protein and is forgiving. It is shown that crystals can be grown in 50-500 pl droplets when the crystallization conditions are compatible with the droplet environment. Local and remote data-collection methods are described and it is shown that crystals grown in microfluidics droplets and housed as an emulsion in an Eppendorf tube can be shipped from the US to the UK using a FedEx envelope, and data can be collected successfully. Details of how crystals were delivered to the X-ray beam by depositing an emulsion of droplets onto a silicon fixed-target serial device are provided. After three months of storage at 4°C, the crystals endured and diffracted well, showing only a slight decrease in diffracting power, demonstrating a suitable way to grow crystals, and to store and collect the droplets with crystals for data collection.

How to efficiently curate and index this large amount of biomedical literature under the current crisis is of great importance. Previous literature indexing is mainly performed by human experts using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, to alleviate the expensive time consumption and monetary cost, there is an urgent need for automatic semantic indexing technologies for the emerging COVID-19 domain.<h4>Results</h4>In this research, to investigate the semantic indexing problem for COVID-19, we first construct the new COVID-19 Semantic Indexing dataset, which consists of more than 80 thousand biomedical articles. We then propose a novel semantic indexing framework based on the multi-probe attention neural network (MPANN) to address the COVID-19 semantic indexing problem. Specifically, we employ a k-nearest neighbour based MeSH masking approach to generate candidate topic terms for each input article. We encode and feed the selected candidate terms as well as other contextual information as probes into the downstream attention-based neural network. Each semantic probe carries specific aspects of biomedical knowledge and provides informatively discriminative features for the input article. After extracting the semantic features at both term-level and document-level through the attention-based neural network, MPANN adopts a linear multi-view classifier to conduct the final topic prediction for COVID-19 semantic indexing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The experimental results suggest that MPANN promises to represent the semantic features of biomedical texts and is effective in predicting semantic topics for COVID-19 related biomedical articles.",False,True,,0.6990296,,mpann,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

They serve as scaffolds for the bottom-up creation of synthetic cells, targeted drug delivery and have been widely used to study membrane related phenomena <i>in vitro</i>. GUVs are also of interest for the functional investigation of membrane proteins that carry out many key cellular functions. A major hurdle to a wider application of GUVs in this field is the diversity of existing protocols that are optimized for individual proteins. Here, we compare PVA assisted and electroformation techniques for GUV formation under physiologically relevant conditions, and analyze the effect of immobilization on vesicle structure and membrane tightness towards small substrates and protons. There, differences in terms of yield, size, and leakage of GUVs produced by PVA assisted swelling and electroformation were found, dependent on salt and buffer composition. Using fusion of oppositely charged membranes to reconstitute a model membrane protein, we find that empty vesicles and proteoliposomes show similar fusion behavior, which allows for a rapid estimation of protein incorporation using fluorescent lipids.",False,True,,0.63135326,,guv,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

It is an ecologically important species from riparian ecosystems, that is used as a parent of interspecific (P. deltoides x P. nigra) cultivated poplar hybrids. Variant detection from transcriptomics sequences of 241 P. nigra individuals, sampled in natural populations from 11 river catchments (in four European countries) is described here. These data provide new valuable resources for population structure analysis, population genomics and genome-wide association studies.<h4>Data description</h4>We generated transcriptomics data from a mixture of young differentiating xylem and cambium tissues of 480 Populus nigra trees sampled in a common garden experiment located at Orléans (France), corresponding to 241 genotypes (2 clonal replicates per genotype, at maximum) by using RNAseq technology. We launched on the resulting sequences an in-silico pipeline that allowed us to obtain 878,957 biallelic polymorphisms without missing data.

Because of increasing rates of multi-drug resistance within the KpSC, there is a growing interest in better understanding the biology and metabolism of these organisms to inform novel control strategies. We collated 37 sequenced KpSC isolates isolated from a variety of niches, representing all seven taxa. We generated strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for all 37 isolates and simulated growth phenotypes on 511 distinct carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus substrates.

We explored species-specific growth capabilities and examined the impact of all possible single gene deletions using growth simulations in 145 core carbon substrates. These analyses revealed multiple strain-specific differences, within and between species, and highlight the importance of selecting a diverse range of strains when exploring KpSC metabolism. This diverse set of highly accurate GEMs could be used to inform novel drug design, enhance genomic analyses, and identify novel virulence and resistance determinants.

To date, most antibacterial systems are based on the use of petro-sourced polymers, but the global supplies of these resources are depleting. Besides, silver NPs are widely accepted as the most active biocide against a wide range of bacterial strains but their toxicity is an issue. The growing interest in natural products has gained increasing interest in the last decade. Therefore, the design of functional antibacterial materials derived from biomass remains a significant challenge for the scientific community. Consequently, attention has shifted to naturally occurring substances such as essential oils (EOs), which are classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). EOs can offer an alternative to the common antimicrobial agents as an inner solution or biocide agent to inhibit the resistance mechanism. Herein, this review not only aims at providing developments in the antibacterial modes of action of EOs against various bacterial strains and the recent advances in genomic and proteomic techniques for the elucidation of these mechanisms but also presents examples of biobased polymer resource-based EO materials and their antibacterial activities. Especially, we describe the antibacterial properties of biobased polymers, <i>e.g.</i> cellulose, starch, chitosan, PLA PHAs and proteins, associated with EOs (cinnamon (CEO), clove (CLEO), bergamot (BEO), ginger (GEO), lemongrass (LEO), caraway (CAEO), rosemary (REO), <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> (EGEO), tea tree (TTEO), orange peel (OPEO) and apricot (<i>Prunus armeniaca</i>) kernel (AKEO) essential oils).

Over the past 6 years, this growing interest has led to the development of more than 100 bioinformatics tools and nearly 50 resources, primarily in the form of ligand-receptor databases. These tools vary widely in their requirements, scoring approaches, ability to infer inter- and/or intra-cellular communication, assumptions, and limitations. Similarly, cell-cell communication resources differ in many aspects, mainly in the number of annotated interactions, species coverage, and their focus on inter-cellular signaling or both inter- and intra-cellular communication. This abundance and diversity create challenges in identifying compatible and suitable tools and resources to meet specific user needs. In this collaborative effort, we aim to provide a comprehensive report on the current state of cell-cell communication analysis derived from single-cell or spatial transcriptomics data. The report reviews existing methods and resources, addressing all relevant aspects from the user's perspective.

Another distinctive feature of the dataset is its eminently fine-grained annotation. Specifically, 179 distinct classes are manually annotated by three raters within four publications, amounting to 2191 entities that were annotated and curated. Conceptual work is presented for the symbolic representation of causal composition-process-microstructure-property relationships.

37030713,A Survey of Computational Methods and Databases for lncRNA-MiRNA Interaction Prediction.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two prevalent non-coding RNAs in current research. They play critical regulatory roles in the life processes of animals and plants. Studies have shown that lncRNAs can interact with miRNAs to participate in post-transcriptional regulatory processes, mainly involved in regulating cancer development, metastatic progression, and drug resistance. Additionally, these interactions have significant effects on plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Deciphering the potential relationships between lncRNAs and miRNAs may provide new insights into our understanding of the biological functions of lncRNAs and miRNAs, and the pathogenesis of complex diseases. In contrast, gathering information on lncRNA-miRNA interactions (LMIs) through biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming. With the accumulation of multi-omics data, computational models are extremely attractive in systematically exploring potential LMIs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of computational methods for identifying LMIs. Specifically, we first summarized the available public databases for predicting animal and plant LMIs. Second, we comprehensively reviewed the computational methods for predicting LMIs and classified them into two categories, including network-based methods and sequence-based methods. Third, we analyzed the standard evaluation methods and metrics used in LMI prediction. Finally, we pointed out some problems in the current study and discuss future research directions.

Breeding and deployment of cultivars with genetic resistance is the most effective and sustainable approach to control these diseases. The genetic toolkit for wheat breeders to select for rust resistance has rapidly expanded with a multitude of genetic loci identified using the latest advances in genomics, mapping and cloning strategies. The goal of this review was to establish a wheat genome atlas that provides a comprehensive summary of reported loci associated with rust resistance. Our atlas provides a summary of mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) and characterised genes for the three rusts from 170 publications over the past two decades. A total of 920 QTL or resistance genes were positioned across the 21 chromosomes of wheat based on the latest wheat reference genome (IWGSC RefSeq v2.1). Interestingly, 26 genomic regions contained multiple rust loci suggesting they could have pleiotropic effects on two or more rust diseases.

We propose a conceptual model of semantic interoperability, comprising intensional and extensional terminological interoperability, as well as logical and schema propositional interoperability. Since there cannot be a universally accepted best vocabulary and best (meta)data schema, establishing semantic interoperability necessitates the provision of comprehensive sets of intensional and extensional entity mappings and schema crosswalks. In accordance with our conceptual model, we suggest additions to the FAIR Guiding Principles that encompass the requirements for semantic interoperability.

These systems are categorised into two types: instance-based and longitudinal-based. Instance-based models only consider the current admission, while longitudinal models consider the patient's medical history. Electronic Health Records are used to incorporate medical history into longitudinal models. This project proposes a novel Knowledge Graph-Driven Medicine Recommendation System using Graph Neural Networks, KGDNet, that utilises longitudinal EHR data along with ontologies and Drug-Drug Interaction knowledge to construct admission-wise clinical and medicine Knowledge Graphs for every patient. Recurrent Neural Networks are employed to model a patient's historical data, and Graph Neural Networks are used to learn embeddings from the Knowledge Graphs. A Transformer-based Attention mechanism is then used to generate medication recommendations for the patient, considering their current clinical state, medication history, and joint medical records. The model is evaluated on the MIMIC-IV EHR data and outperforms existing methods in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, Jaccard score, and Drug-Drug Interaction control.

The methodology employed an innovative IoT system, integrating a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) tracker and environmental sensors mounted on the animals to accurately monitor the extent, intensity, and frequency of grazing. The experimental results demonstrated the high performance and robustness of the IoT system, with minimal data loss and significant battery efficiency, validating its suitability for long-term field evaluations. Long Range (LoRa) technology ensured consistent communication over long distances, covering the entire grazing zone and a range of 6 km in open areas. The superior battery performance, enhanced by a solar panel, allowed uninterrupted operation for up to 37 days with 5-min interval acquisitions. The GNSS module provided high-resolution data on movement patterns, with an accuracy of up to 10 m after firmware adjustments. The two-part division of the device ensured it did not rotate on the animals' necks. The system demonstrated adaptability and resilience in various terrains and animal conditions, confirming the viability of IoT-based systems for pasture monitoring and highlighting their potential to improve silvopastoral management, promoting sustainable practices and conservation strategies.

Data of 2016 onwards were collected, harmonised, and annotated. The data sets spatial, temporal, and thematic quality were assessed applying rules developed in this research. Currently, the repository holds around 75 million harmonised observations with standardized metadata of which a large share is available to the public. The repository, funded by ESA through the WorldCereal project, can be used for either the calibration of image classification deep learning algorithms or the validation of Earth Observation generated products, such as global cropland extent and maize and wheat maps.

Our subsequent spatial correlation analysis systematically compared the PPs to known anatomical regions and ontology from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas using spatial neighborhoods. We demonstrate that our stable and spatially coherent PPs, whose linear combinations accurately approximate the spatial gene data, are highly correlated with combinations of expert-annotated brain regions. These PPs yield a brain ontology based purely on spatial gene expression. Our PP identification approach outperforms principal component analysis and typical clustering algorithms on the same task. Moreover, we show that the stable PPs reveal marked regional imbalance of brainwide genetic architecture, leading to region-specific marker genes and gene coexpression networks.

In this work, we exploit topology optimization to design a compact vertical coupler incorporating a bottom reflector, which achieves sub-decibel coupling efficiency on the 220-nm silicon-on-insulator platform. The final design of the vertical coupler yields a predicted coupling efficiency of -0.35 dB at the wavelength of 1550 nm with a footprint of 14 µm × 14 µm, which is considerably smaller than conventional grating couplers. Its topology-optimized geometry can be realized by applying one full-etch and one 70-nm shallow-etch process and the fabricability is also guaranteed by a minimum feature size around 150 nm. Analysis of the potential fabrication imperfections indicates that the topology-optimized coupler is more resilient to in-plane variations, as the deviation of approximately ±100 nm in the misalignment of the topology-optimized features, ±20 nm in the size of the topology-optimized features, and ±10 nm in shallow etch depth yields an additional 1-dB loss as a penalty at the wavelength of 1550 nm.

In the era of big data, the scientific literature concerning big data is a significant source of information; however, it is difficult to construct an optimal policy based on traditional insight using keyword searches or a single static-specialized database. In this study, we constructed a new path for data mining across multiple databases to provide a comprehensive picture of the major issues concerning environmental pollution and human health as a result of pesticide use at the global scale. This approach uses a classic unsupervised learning algorithm, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), in combination with a newly developed dataset of pesticide-associated human health outcomes (PAHHO), including 618 health outcomes classified into 14 types of toxic effects.

Here, we generate and experimentally validate structural predictions that support the trimeric state of a platform protein PulF from a type II secretion system. The PulF trimers form selective proton or sodium channels which might energize pilus assembly using the membrane potential.

Here, we employed extrachromosomal circular DNA sequencing (Circle-seq) to generate a comprehensive dataset of eccDNA from six brain structures of both young and naturally-aged mice, including the olfactory bulb, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Furthermore, through database annotation, we characterized the properties of mouse brain eccDNA, thereby gaining insights into the potential functions of eccDNA in the mouse brain. In conclusion, our study addresses a previously unexplored area by providing a comprehensive molecular characterization of eccDNA in brain tissues. The data presented in the study can be used as a fundamental resource to associate the molecular phenotypes of eccDNA with brain aging and gain deep insights into the biological role of eccDNA in mammalian brain aging.",False,True,,0.6208364,,eccdna,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39374247,Entity Linking for real-time geolocation of natural disasters from social network posts.,"When a fast kinetic natural disaster occurs, it is crucial that crisis managers quickly understand the extent of the situation, especially through the development of ""big picture"" maps. For many years, great efforts have been made to use social networks to help build this situational awareness. While there are many models for automatically extracting information from posts, the difficulty remains in detecting and geolocating this information on the fly so that it can be placed on maps. Whilst most of the work carried out to date on this subject has been based on data in English, we tackle the problem of detecting and geolocating natural disasters from French messages posted on the Twitter platform (now renamed ""X""). To this end, we first build an appropriate dataset comprised of documents from the French Wikipedia corpus, the dataset from the CAp 2017 challenge, and a homemade annotated Twitter dataset extracted during French natural disasters. We then developed an Entity-Linking pipeline in adequacy with our end-application use case: real-time prediction and peak resiliency. We show that despite these two additional constraints, our system's performances are on par with state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, the entities geolocated by our model show a strong coherence with the spatiotemporal signature of the natural disasters considered, which suggests that it could usefully contribute to automatic social network analysis for crisis managers.",False,True,,0.7003542,an entity-linking pipeline in adequacy with our end-application use case: real-time prediction and peak resiliency,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39046587,Construction of an expression platform for fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis in Penicillium crustosum.,"Filamentous fungi are prolific producers of bioactive natural products and play a vital role in drug discovery. Yet, their potential cannot be fully exploited since many biosynthetic genes are silent or cryptic under laboratory culture conditions. Several strategies have been applied to activate these genes, with heterologous expression as one of the most promising approaches. However, successful expression and identification of new products are often hindered by host-dependent factors, such as low gene targeting efficiencies, a high metabolite background, or a lack of selection markers. To overcome these challenges, we have constructed a Penicillium crustosum expression host in a pyrG deficient strain by combining the split-marker strategy and CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Deletion of ligD and pcribo improved gene targeting efficiencies and enabled the use of an additional selection marker in P. crustosum. Furthermore, we reduced the secondary metabolite background by inactivation of two highly expressed gene clusters and abolished the formation of the reactive ortho-quinone methide. Finally, we replaced the P. crustosum pigment gene pcr4401 with the commonly used Aspergillus nidulans wA expression site for convenient use of constructs originally designed for A. nidulans in our P. crustosum host strain. As proof of concept, we successfully expressed a single polyketide synthase gene and an entire gene cluster at the P. crustosum wA locus. Resulting transformants were easily detected by their albino phenotype. With this study, we provide a highly efficient platform for heterologous expression of fungal genes. KEY POINTS: Construction of a highly efficient Penicillium crustosum heterologous expression host Reduction of secondary metabolite background by genetic dereplication strategy Integration of wA site to provide an alternative host besides Aspergillus nidulans.",False,True,,0.62376606,penicillium crustosum expression host in a,key,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
34999771,Inferring gene regulatory network via fusing gene expression image and RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Recently, with the development of high-throughput experimental technology, reconstruction of gene regulatory network (GRN) has ushered in new opportunities and challenges. Some previous methods mainly extract gene expression information based on RNA-seq data, but the associated information is very limited. With the establishment of gene expression image database, it is possible to infer GRN from image data with rich spatial information.<h4>Results</h4>First, we propose a new convolutional neural network (called SDINet), which can extract gene expression information from images and identify the interaction between genes. SDINet can obtain the detailed information and high-level semantic information from the images well. And it can achieve satisfying performance on image data (Acc: 0.7196, F1: 0.7374). Second, we apply the idea of our SDINet to build an RNA-model, which also achieves good results on RNA-seq data (Acc: 0.8962, F1: 0.8950). Finally, we combine image data and RNA-seq data, and design a new fusion network to explore the potential relationship between them. Experiments show that our proposed network fusing two modalities can obtain satisfying performance (Acc: 0.9116, F1: 0.9118) than any single data.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Data and code are available from https://github.com/guofei-tju/Combine-Gene-Expression-images-and-RNA-seq-data-For-infering-GRN.",False,True,,0.7087946,,sdinet | 0.7196,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,https://github.com/guofei-tju/Combine-Gene-Expression-images-and-RNA-seq-data-For-infering-GRN,,False,,1

By making this dataset available, a critical gap in the availability of public datasets that can be used for developing and testing artificial intelligence techniques for tuberculosis diagnosis is addressed. Our rationale is grounded in the urgent need for diagnostic tools that can enhance tuberculosis diagnosis quickly and efficiently, especially in resource-limited settings.<h4>Approach</h4>The Ziehl-Neelsen method was used to prepare 362 slides, which were manually read. According to the World Health Organization's guidelines for performing bacilloscopy for tuberculosis diagnosis, experts annotated each slide to diagnose it as negative or positive. In addition, selected images underwent a detailed annotation process aimed at pinpointing the location of each bacillus and cluster within each image.<h4>Results</h4>The database consists of three directories. The first contains all the images, separated by slide, and indicates whether it is negative or the number of crosses if positive, for each slide. The second directory contains the 502 images selected for training automated systems, with each bacillus's position annotated and the Python code used. All the image fragments (positive and negative patches) used in the models' training, validation, and testing stages are available in the third directory.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The development of this annotated image database represents a significant advancement in tuberculosis diagnosis. By providing a high-quality and accessible resource to the scientific community, we enhance existing diagnostic tools and facilitate the development of automated technologies.",False,True,,0.68677485,ziehl-neelsen method was used to prepare 362 slides,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39702046,Exploitation of phylum-spanning omics resources reveals complexity in the nematode FLP signalling system and provides insights into flp-gene evolution.,"<h4>Background</h4>Parasitic nematodes significantly undermine global human and animal health and productivity. Parasite control is reliant on anthelmintic administration however over-use of a limited number of drugs has resulted in escalating parasitic nematode resistance, threatening the sustainability of parasite control and underscoring an urgent need for the development of novel therapeutics. FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs), the largest family of nematode neuropeptides, modulate nematode behaviours including those important for parasite survival, highlighting FLP receptors (FLP-GPCRs) as appealing putative novel anthelmintic targets. Advances in omics resources have enabled the identification of FLPs and neuropeptide-GPCRs in some parasitic nematodes, but remaining gaps in FLP-ligand libraries hinder the characterisation of receptor-ligand interactions, which are required to drive the development of novel control approaches.<h4>Results</h4>In this study we exploited recent expansions in nematode genome data to identify 2143 flp-genes in > 100 nematode species across free-living, entomopathogenic, plant, and animal parasitic lifestyles and representing 7 of the 12 major nematode clades. Our data reveal that: (i) the phylum-spanning flps, flp-1, -8, -14, and - 18, may be representative of the flp profile of the last common ancestor of nematodes; (ii) the majority of parasitic nematodes have a reduced flp complement relative to free-living species; (iii) FLP prepropeptide architecture is variable within and between flp-genes and across nematode species; (iv) FLP prepropeptide signatures facilitate flp-gene discrimination; (v) FLP motifs display variable length, amino acid sequence, and conservation; (vi) CLANS analysis provides insight into the evolutionary history of flp-gene sequelogues and reveals putative flp-gene paralogues and, (vii) flp expression is upregulated in the infective larval stage of several nematode parasites.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data provide the foundation required for phylum-spanning FLP-GPCR deorphanisation screens in nematodes to seed the discovery and development of novel parasite control approaches.",False,True,,0.6002775,,clans,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40226443,Guidelines and metadata model for a repository of volcanic samples.,"The volcanological community manages heterogeneous types of data acquired during research projects and monitoring activities of volcanoes. These data consist of both continuous and discrete measurements and observations, which are carried out by ground-based networks and remote sensing instruments, or during field surveys and laboratory analyses. Many types of volcanological research are largely based on the accurate sampling of rocks erupted during past and ongoing volcanic activity. Each sample represents a ""physical object"" which should be identified and archived before part of it is removed for analytical purposes. In this context, we recommend assigning the collected samples unique and persistent identifiers, such as the International Generic Sample Number (IGSN). However, although the IGSN allows recording the most essential information of the collected samples (e.g. geographic location, sampling method, and collector), the predefined metadata fields are not exhaustive for volcanic samples, which require additional information such as type and timing of the eruptive event, sample temperature, and texture. Here we design the guidelines necessary to facilitate communication between and search of multiple sample repositories and databases run by disparate institutions. To this aim, we build a metadata model, which integrate the IGSN metadata with supplementary information necessary for the monitoring and research activities carried out by the volcanological community. The long-term curation of collected materials is an important investment for the future. Indeed, these collections are a resource for the production of volcanological data, they reduce the need for repeated sampling, they preserve samples that can no longer be collected, and they allow repeat analyses to be made. The primary aim of this work, based on discussion within the EUROVOLC project, is to provide the basic information for populating a relational database structure in the future for the description of different volcanic samples, physically located in different physical repositories and institutions, in order to facilitate future sharing between different groups of scientists and more complete volcanological studies, by means of the proposed metadata structure.",False,True,,0.7146937,,igsn | eurovolc,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36441742,An effective spatial relational reasoning networks for visual question answering.,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a method of answering questions in natural language based on the content of images and has been widely concerned by researchers. The existing research on the visual question answering model mainly focuses on the point of view of attention mechanism and multi-modal fusion. It only pays attention to the visual semantic features of the image in the process of image modeling, ignoring the importance of modeling the spatial relationship of visual objects. We are aiming at the existing problems of the existing VQA model research. An effective spatial relationship reasoning network model is proposed, which can combine visual object semantic reasoning and spatial relationship reasoning at the same time to realize fine-grained multi-modal reasoning and fusion. A sparse attention encoder is designed to capture contextual information effectively in the semantic reasoning module. In the spatial relationship reasoning module, the graph neural network attention mechanism is used to model the spatial relationship of visual objects, which can correctly answer complex spatial relationship reasoning questions. Finally, a practical compact self-attention (CSA) mechanism is designed to reduce the redundancy of self-attention in linear transformation and the number of model parameters and effectively improve the model's overall performance. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of VQA 2.0 and GQA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches. Our best single model has an overall accuracy of 71.18% on the VQA 2.0 dataset and 57.59% on the GQA dataset.",False,True,,0.6825889,,vqa | csa,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
35049120,Incorporating genome-based phylogeny and functional similarity into diversity assessments helps to resolve a global collection of human gut metagenomes.,"Tree-based diversity measures incorporate phylogenetic or functional relatedness into comparisons of microbial communities. This can improve the identification of explanatory factors compared to tree-agnostic diversity measures. However, applying tree-based diversity measures to metagenome data is more challenging than for single-locus sequencing (e.g. 16S rRNA gene). Utilizing the Genome Taxonomy Database for species-level metagenome profiling allows for functional diversity measures based on genomic content or traits inferred from it. Still, it is unclear how metagenome-based assessments of microbiome diversity benefit from incorporating phylogeny or function into measures of diversity. We assessed this by measuring phylogeny-based, function-based and tree-agnostic diversity measures from a large, global collection of human gut metagenomes composed of 30 studies and 2943 samples. We found tree-based measures to explain phenotypic variation (e.g. westernization, disease status and gender) better or equivalent to tree-agnostic measures. Ecophylogenetic and functional diversity measures provided unique insight into how microbiome diversity was partitioned by phenotype. Tree-based measures greatly improved machine learning model performance for predicting westernization, disease status and gender, relative to models trained solely on tree-agnostic measures. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of tree- and function-based measures for metagenomic assessments of microbial diversity, which is a fundamental component of microbiome science.",False,True,,0.64267665,genome taxonomy database,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1
40013513,Construction of an atlas of transcription factor binding during mouse development identifies popular regulatory regions.,"Gene regulators physically associate with the genome, in a combinatorial fashion, to drive tissue-specific gene expression. Uncovering the genome-wide activity of all gene regulators across tissues is therefore needed to understand gene regulation during development. Here, we take a first step towards this goal. Using CUT&RUN, we systematically mapped genome-wide binding profiles of key transcription factors and co-factors that mediate ontogenetically relevant signaling pathways in select mouse tissues at two developmental stages. Computation of the datasets unveiled tissue- and time-specific activity for each gene regulator. We identified 'popular' regulatory regions that are bound by a multitude of regulators, which tend to be more evolutionarily conserved. Consistently, they lie near the transcription start site of genes for which dysregulation results in early embryonic lethality. Moreover, the human homologs of these regions are similarly bound by many gene regulators and are highly conserved, indicating a retained relevance for human development. This work constitutes a decisive step towards understanding how the genome is simultaneously read and used by gene regulators in a holistic fashion to drive embryonic development.",False,True,,0.6989566,,cut&run,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
35589837,Prediction of protein-protein interaction using graph neural networks.,"Proteins are the essential biological macromolecules required to perform nearly all biological processes, and cellular functions. Proteins rarely carry out their tasks in isolation but interact with other proteins (known as protein-protein interaction) present in their surroundings to complete biological activities. The knowledge of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) unravels the cellular behavior and its functionality. The computational methods automate the prediction of PPI and are less expensive than experimental methods in terms of resources and time. So far, most of the works on PPI have mainly focused on sequence information. Here, we use graph convolutional network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT) to predict the interaction between proteins by utilizing protein's structural information and sequence features. We build the graphs of proteins from their PDB files, which contain 3D coordinates of atoms. The protein graph represents the amino acid network, also known as residue contact network, where each node is a residue. Two nodes are connected if they have a pair of atoms (one from each node) within the threshold distance. To extract the node/residue features, we use the protein language model. The input to the language model is the protein sequence, and the output is the feature vector for each amino acid of the underlying sequence. We validate the predictive capability of the proposed graph-based approach on two PPI datasets: Human and S. cerevisiae. Obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as it outperforms the previous leading methods.

35524337,Evaluating metagenomic assembly approaches for biome-specific gene catalogues.,"<h4>Background</h4>For many environments, biome-specific microbial gene catalogues are being recovered using shotgun metagenomics followed by assembly and gene calling on the assembled contigs. The assembly is typically conducted either by individually assembling each sample or by co-assembling reads from all the samples. The co-assembly approach can potentially recover genes that display too low abundance to be assembled from individual samples. On the other hand, combining samples increases the risk of mixing data from closely related strains, which can hamper the assembly process. In this respect, assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of (near) identical genes is preferable. Thus, both approaches have potential pros and cons, but it remains to be evaluated which assembly strategy is most effective. Here, we have evaluated three assembly strategies for generating gene catalogues from metagenomes using a dataset of 124 samples from the Baltic Sea: (1) assembly on individual samples followed by clustering of the resulting genes, (2) co-assembly on all samples, and (3) mix assembly, combining individual and co-assembly.<h4>Results</h4>The mix-assembly approach resulted in a more extensive nonredundant gene set than the other approaches and with more genes predicted to be complete and that could be functionally annotated. The mix assembly consists of 67 million genes (Baltic Sea gene set, BAGS) that have been functionally and taxonomically annotated. The majority of the BAGS genes are dissimilar (< 95% amino acid identity) to the Tara Oceans gene dataset, and hence, BAGS represents a valuable resource for brackish water research.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The mix-assembly approach represents a feasible approach to increase the information obtained from metagenomic samples.

Overcoming efflux requires an in-depth understanding of efflux pump functions, specificities and the development of inhibitors. However, the complexities of efflux networks have limited such studies. To address these challenges, we generated Efflux KnockOut-35 (EKO-35), a highly susceptible Escherichia coli strain lacking 35 efflux pumps. We demonstrate the use of this strain by constructing an efflux platform comprising EKO-35 strains individually producing efflux pumps forming tripartite complexes with TolC. This platform was profiled against a curated diverse compound collection, which enabled us to define physicochemical properties that contribute to transport. We also show the E. coli drug efflux network is conditionally essential for growth, and that the platform can be used to investigate efflux pump inhibitor specificities and efflux pump interplay.

OntoCR, a clinical repository developed at Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, uses ontologies to represent clinical knowledge and map locally defined variables to health information standards and common data models.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of the study is to design and implement a scalable methodology based on the dual-model paradigm and the use of ontologies to consolidate clinical data from different organizations in a standardized repository for research purposes without loss of meaning.<h4>Methods</h4>First, the relevant clinical variables are defined, and the corresponding European Norm/International Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 archetypes are created. Data sources are then identified, and an extract, transform, and load process is carried out. Once the final data set is obtained, the data are transformed to create EN/ISO 13606-normalized electronic health record (EHR) extracts. Afterward, ontologies that represent archetyped concepts and map them to EN/ISO 13606 and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards are created and uploaded to OntoCR. Data stored in the extracts are inserted into its corresponding place in the ontology, thus obtaining instantiated patient data in the ontology-based repository. Finally, data can be extracted via SPARQL queries as OMOP CDM-compliant tables.<h4>Results</h4>Using this methodology, EN/ISO 13606-standardized archetypes that allow for the reuse of clinical information were created, and the knowledge representation of our clinical repository by modeling and mapping ontologies was extended. Furthermore, EN/ISO 13606-compliant EHR extracts of patients (6803), episodes (13,938), diagnosis (190,878), administered medication (222,225), cumulative drug dose (222,225), prescribed medication (351,247), movements between units (47,817), clinical observations (6,736,745), laboratory observations (3,392,873), limitation of life-sustaining treatment (1,298), and procedures (19,861) were created. Since the creation of the application that inserts data from extracts into the ontologies is not yet finished, the queries were tested and the methodology was validated by importing data from a random subset of patients into the ontologies using a locally developed Protégé plugin (""OntoLoad""). In total, 10 OMOP CDM-compliant tables (""Condition_occurrence,"" 864 records; ""Death,"" 110; ""Device_exposure,"" 56; ""Drug_exposure,"" 5609; ""Measurement,"" 2091; ""Observation,"" 195; ""Observation_period,"" 897; ""Person,"" 922; ""Visit_detail,"" 772; and ""Visit_occurrence,"" 971) were successfully created and populated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study proposes a methodology for standardizing clinical data, thus allowing its reuse without any changes in the meaning of the modeled concepts. Although this paper focuses on health research, our methodology suggests that the data be initially standardized per EN/ISO 13606 to obtain EHR extracts with a high level of granularity that can be used for any purpose.

37900105,A Protocol to Retrieve and Curate Spatial and Climatic Data from Online Biodiversity Databases Using R.,"Ecological and evolutionary studies often require high quality biodiversity data. This information is readily available through the many online databases that have compiled biodiversity data from herbaria, museums, and human observations. However, the process of preparing this information for analysis is complex and time consuming. In this study, we have developed a protocol in R language to process spatial data (download, merge, clean, and correct) and extract climatic data, using some genera of the ginseng family (Araliaceae) as an example. The protocol provides an automated way to process spatial and climatic data for numerous taxa independently and from multiple online databases. The script uses GBIF, BIEN, and WorldClim as the online data sources, but can be easily adapted to include other online databases. The script also uses genera as the sampling unit but provides a way to use species as the target. The cleaning process includes a filter to remove occurrences outside the natural range of the taxa, gardens, and other human environments, as well as erroneous locations and a spatial correction for misplaced occurrences (i.e., occurrences within a distance buffer from the coastal boundary). Additionally, each step of the protocol can be run independently. Thus, the protocol can begin with data cleaning, if the database has already been compiled, or with climatic data extraction, if the database has already been parsed.

However, the origin of the virus is still unclear; knowing where the virus came from could help us prevent future zoonotic epidemics. Sequencing data, particularly metagenomic data, can profile the genomes of all species in the sample, including those not recognized at the time, thus allowing for the identification of the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected before the pandemic. We analyzed the data from 5,196 SARS-CoV-2-positive sequencing runs in the NCBI's SRA database with collection dates prior to 2020 or unknown. We found that the mutation patterns obtained from these suspicious SARS-CoV-2 reads did not match the genome characteristics of an unknown progenitor of the virus, suggesting that they may derive from circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants or other coronaviruses. Despite a negative result for tracking the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, the methods developed in the study could assist in pinpointing the origin of various pathogens in the future. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Sequences that are homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 genome were found in numerous sequencing runs that were not associated with the SARS-CoV-2 studies in the public database. It is unclear whether they are derived from the possible progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 or contamination of more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants circulated in the population due to the lack of information on the collection, library preparation, and sequencing processes.

The objective of this study is to develop an effective text-mining approach that automatically extracts clinical phenotype definitions-related sentences from biomedical literature. Abstract-level and full-text sentence-level classifiers were developed for clinical phenotype discovery from PubMed. We compared the performance of the abstract-level classifier on machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes, and decision tree. SVM classifier showed the best performance (F-measure = 98%) in identifying clinical phenotype-relevant abstracts. It predicted 459 406 clinical phenotype-related abstracts. For the full-text sentence-level classifier, we compared the performance of SVM, LR, naïve Bayes, decision trees, convolutional neural networks, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT). BioBERT model was the best performer among the full-text sentence-level classifiers (F-measure = 91%). We used these two optimal classifiers for large-scale screening of the PubMed database, starting with abstract retrieval and followed by predicting clinical phenotype-related sentences from full texts. The large-scale screening predicted over two million clinical phenotype-related sentences. Lastly, we developed a knowledgebase using positively predicted sentences, allowing users to query clinical phenotype-related sentences with a phenotype term of interest. The Clinical Phenotype Knowledgebase (CliPheKB) enables users to search for clinical phenotype terms and retrieve sentences related to a specific clinical phenotype of interest (https://cliphekb.shinyapps.io/phenotype-main/).

39636867,Endo-IP and lyso-IP toolkit for endolysosomal profiling of human-induced neurons.,"Plasma membrane protein degradation and recycling are regulated by the endolysosomal system, wherein endocytic vesicles bud from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm and mature into endosomes and then degradative lysosomes. As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface and influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we develop a toolkit for capturing EEA1-positive endosomes (termed Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (termed Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrate its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for stem cells and cortical-like iNeurons, and profiling endosomes in response to potassium-mediated neuronal depolarization. Through global profiling of endocytic cargo, we identify hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets.

This dataset contains 17 wave parameters, including the information associated with wave energy and spectral shape geometries, from one historical (1950-2014) simulation and three future (2015-2100) scenario experiments (ssp125, ssp245, and ssp585). Moreover, all the parameters can be accessed separately in the form of wind waves and swells. The historical results show that the simulated wave characteristics agree well with satellite observations and the ERA5 reanalysis products.

40013795,Long-read transcriptomics of caviid gammaherpesvirus 1: compiling a comprehensive RNA atlas.,"Caviid gammaherpesvirus 1 (CaGHV-1), formerly known as the guinea pig herpes-like virus, is an oncogenic gammaherpesvirus with a sequenced genome but an as-yet uncharacterized transcriptome. Using nanopore long-read RNA sequencing, we annotated the CaGHV-1 genome and constructed a detailed transcriptomic atlas. Our findings reveal diverse viral mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, along with mapped promoter elements for each viral gene. We demonstrated that the CaGHV-1 RTA lytic cycle transcription factor activates its own promoter, similar to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and that the CaGHV-1 ORF50 promoter responds to RTA proteins from other gammaherpesviruses, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of RTA-mediated transcriptional mechanisms. Additionally, our analysis uncovered extensive transcriptional overlap within the viral genome, suggesting a role in regulating global gene expression. Given its tumorigenic properties, broad host range, and non-human pathogenicity, this work establishes CaGHV-1 as a promising small animal model for investigating human gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis.<h4>Importance</h4>The molecular underpinnings of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis remain poorly understood, partly due to limited animal models. This study provides the first comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of CaGHV-1, highlighting both coding and non-coding RNAs and revealing regulatory elements that drive viral gene expression. Functional studies of the CaGHV-1 RTA transcription factor demonstrated its ability to self-activate and cross-activate promoters from homologous gammaherpesviruses, reflecting conserved mechanisms of transcriptional control. These findings solidify CaGHV-1 as a unique and versatile small animal model, offering new opportunities to investigate gammaherpesvirus replication, transcriptional regulation, and tumorigenesis in a controlled experimental system.",False,True,,0.60424,,orf50,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Long-read transcriptomics of caviid gammaherpesvirus,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Presently, most methods for inferring gene regulatory and biological networks rely on association studies or observational causal-analysis approaches. This study introduces a novel approach that combines intervention operations and diffusion models within a do-calculus framework by deep learning, i.e., Causal Diffusion Do-calculus (CDD) analysis, to infer causal networks between molecules. CDD can extract causal relations from observed data owing to its intervention operations, thereby significantly enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of causal network inference. Computationally, CDD has been applied to both simulated data and real omics data, which demonstrates that CDD outperforms existing methods in accurately inferring gene regulatory networks and identifying causal links from genes to disease phenotypes. Especially, compared with the Mendelian randomization algorithm and other existing methods, the CDD can reliably identify the disease genes or molecules for complex diseases with better performances. In addition, the causal analysis between various diseases and the potential factors in different populations from the UK Biobank database is also conducted, which further validated the effectiveness of CDD.",False,True,,0.6901036,,cdd,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Despite extensive research, no effective therapeutics are yet available to treat these chronic degenerative diseases. Targeting the aggregation of disease-specific proteins is regarded as a promising new approach to treat these diseases. In the past few years, rapid progress in this field has been made <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo</i>, and <i>in silico</i> to generate potential drug candidates, ranging from small molecules to polymers to nanoparticles. Small molecular probes, mostly those derived from natural sources, have been of particular interest among amyloid inhibitors. Here, we summarize some of the most important natural small molecular probes which can inhibit the aggregation of Aβ, hIAPP, and α-syn peptides and discuss how their binding efficacy and preference for the peptides vary with their structure and conformation.

35606797,An annotated corpus of clinical trial publications supporting schema-based relational information extraction.,"<h4>Background</h4>The evidence-based medicine paradigm requires the ability to aggregate and compare outcomes of interventions across different trials. This can be facilitated and partially automatized by information extraction systems. In order to support the development of systems that can extract information from published clinical trials at a fine-grained and comprehensive level to populate a knowledge base, we present a richly annotated corpus at two levels. At the first level, entities that describe components of the PICO elements (e.g., population's age and pre-conditions, dosage of a treatment, etc.) are annotated. The second level comprises schema-level (i.e., slot-filling templates) annotations corresponding to complex PICO elements and other concepts related to a clinical trial (e.g. the relation between an intervention and an arm, the relation between an outcome and an intervention, etc.).<h4>Results</h4>The final corpus includes 211 annotated clinical trial abstracts with substantial agreement between annotators at the entity and scheme level. The mean Kappa value for the glaucoma and T2DM corpora was 0.74 and 0.68, respectively, for single entities. The micro-averaged F<sub>1</sub> score to measure inter-annotator agreement for complex entities (i.e. slot-filling templates) was 0.81.The BERT-base baseline method for entity recognition achieved average micro- F<sub>1</sub> scores of 0.76 for glaucoma and 0.77 for diabetes with exact matching.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this work, we have created a corpus that goes beyond the existing clinical trial corpora, since it is annotated in a schematic way that represents the classes and properties defined in an ontology. Although the corpus is small, it has fine-grained annotations and could be used to fine-tune pre-trained machine learning models and transformers to the specific task of extracting information about clinical trial abstracts.For future work, we will use the corpus for training information extraction systems that extract single entities, and predict template slot-fillers (i.e., class data/object properties) to populate a knowledge base that relies on the C-TrO ontology for the description of clinical trials.

These altogether provided a collection of 1556 sequenced genomes of 1501 diverse accessions (1.5 K). The collection comprises of wild, landraces and elite cultivars of soybean that were grown in East Asia or major soybean cultivating areas around the world. Our extensive sequence analysis discovered 32 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (32mSNPs) and revealed a SNP density of 30 SNPs/kb and 12 non-synonymous SNPs/gene reflecting a high structural and functional genomic diversity of the new collection. Each SNP was annotated with 30 categories of structural and/or functional information. We further identified paired accessions between the 1.5 K and 20,087 (20 K) accessions in US collection as genomic ""equivalent"" accessions sharing the highest genomic identity for minimizing the barriers in soybean germplasm exchange between countries. We also exemplified the utility of 32mSNPs in enhancing post-genomics research through in-silico genotyping, high-resolution GWAS, discovering and/or characterizing genes and alleles/mutations, identifying germplasms containing beneficial alleles that are potentially experiencing artificial selection.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The comprehensive analysis of publicly available large-scale genome sequencing data of diverse cultivated accessions and the newly in-house sequenced wild accessions greatly increased the soybean genome-wide variation resolution. This could facilitate a variety of genetic and molecular-level analyses in soybean. The 32mSNPs and 1.5 K accessions with their comprehensive annotation have been made available at the SoyBase and Ag Data Commons.

These protein expression profiles offer profound insights into intertumor heterogeneity and cancer dependency and serve as sensitive functional readouts for somatic alterations. We develop a systematic protein-centered strategy for identifying synthetic lethality pairs and experimentally validate an interaction between protein kinase A subunit α and epidermal growth factor receptor.

This study aims to investigate how these VOCs affect host cells at proteome level to better understand the mechanisms of disease. To achieve this, we first analyzed the (phospho)proteome changes of host cells infected with Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 and BA.5 variants over time frames extending from 1 to 36 h post infection. Our results revealed distinct temporal patterns of protein expression across the VOCs, with notable differences in the (phospho)proteome dynamics that suggest variant-specific adaptations. Specifically, we observed enhanced expression and activation of key components within crucial cellular pathways such as the RHO GTPase cycle, RNA splicing, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD)-related processes. We further utilized proximity biotinylation mass spectrometry (BioID-MS) to investigate how specific mutation of these VOCs influence viral-host protein interactions. Our comprehensive interactomics dataset uncovers distinct interaction profiles for each variant, illustrating how specific mutations can change viral protein functionality. Overall, our extensive analysis provides a detailed proteomic profile of host cells for each variant, offering valuable insights into how specific mutations may influence viral protein functionality and impact therapeutic target identification.

39080339,Semantic-enhanced graph neural network for named entity recognition in ancient Chinese books.,"Named entity recognition (NER) plays a crucial role in the extraction and utilization of knowledge of ancient Chinese books. However, the challenges of ancient Chinese NER not only originate from linguistic features such as the use of single characters and short sentences but are also exacerbated by the scarcity of training data. These factors together limit the capability of deep learning models, like BERT-CRF, in capturing the semantic representation of ancient Chinese characters. In this paper, we explore the semantic enhancement of NER in ancient Chinese books through the utilization of external knowledge. We propose a novel model based on Graph Neural Networks that integrates two different forms of external knowledge: dictionary-level and chapter-level information. Through the Graph Attention Mechanism (GAT), these external knowledge are effectively incorporated into the model's input context. Our model is evaluated on the C_CLUE dataset, showing an improvement of 3.82% over the baseline BAC-CRF model.

However, the lack of trained cytopathologists hinders its widespread implementation in low-resource settings. Deep learning-assisted telecytology diagnosis emerges as an appealing alternative, but it requires the collection of large annotated training datasets, which is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we demonstrate that the abundance of unlabeled images that can be extracted from Pap smear test whole slide images presents a fertile ground for self-supervised learning methods, yielding performance improvements compared to off-the-shelf pre-trained models for various downstream tasks. In particular, we propose Cervical Cell Copy-Pasting (C<sup>3</sup>P) as an effective augmentation method, which enables knowledge transfer from public and labeled single-cell datasets to unlabeled tiles. Not only does C<sup>3</sup>P outperforms naive transfer from single-cell images, but we also demonstrate its advantageous integration into multiple instance learning methods. Importantly, all our experiments are conducted on our introduced in-house dataset comprising liquid-based cytology Pap smear images obtained using low-cost technologies.

These include Antarctic collections from surface ice and snow, as well as glacial sediments from the eroded top of nunataks-summits outcropping from the icesheet-and moraines. Collections extracted from deep-sea sediments (DSS) produced a large number of micrometeorites, in particular, iron-rich cosmic spherules that are rarer in other collections. Collections from the old and stable surface of the Atacama Desert show that finding large numbers of micrometeorites is not restricted to polar regions or DSS. The advent of rooftop collections marks an important step into involving citizen science in the study of micrometeorites, as well as providing potential sampling locations over all latitudes to explore the modern flux. We explore their strengths of the collections to address specific scientific questions and their potential weaknesses. The future of micrometeorite research will involve the finding of large fossil micrometeorite collections and benefit from recent advances in sampling cosmic dust directly from the air.

A substantial portion of the data has not been quality assured and is in difficult-to-access formats such as scanned PDF documents. These obstacles collectively make it challenging to maximize the impact of these monitoring efforts such as efficiently evaluating long-term water quality trends. To address this opportunity, we gathered available surface water quality information from five watersheds in the Arequipa Region of southern Peru: Camaná, Chili, Ocoña, Tambo, and Yauca.

Significant work has been done in the direction of biomedical KB creation and KB completion, specifically, those having gene-disease associations and other related entities. However, the use of such biomedical KBs in combination with patients' temporal clinical data still largely remains unexplored, but has the potential to immensely benefit medical diagnostic decision support systems.<h4>Results</h4>We propose two new algorithms, LOADDx and SCADDx, to combine a patient's gene expression data with gene-disease association and other related information available in the form of a KB, to assist personalized disease diagnosis. We have tested both of the algorithms on two KBs and on four real-world gene expression datasets of respiratory viral infection caused by Influenza-like viruses of 19 subtypes. We also compare the performance of proposed algorithms with that of five existing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms (k-NN, Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear SVM, and SVM with RBF Kernel) using two validation approaches: LOOCV and a single internal validation set. Both SCADDx and LOADDx outperform the existing algorithms when evaluated with both validation approaches. SCADDx is able to detect infections with up to 100% accuracy in the cases of Datasets 2 and 3.

Moreover, the proposed algorithms can provide a short ranked list of the most likely diseases for each patient along with their most affected genes, and other entities linked with them in the KB, which can support health care professionals in their decision-making.",False,True,,0.6631707,,scaddx,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Although multiple versions of RJF (galgal2-galgal5 and GRCg6a) and commercial chickens (GRCg7b/w and Huxu) genomes have been assembled since 2004, no high-quality indigenous chicken genomes have been assembled, hampering the understanding of chicken domestication and evolution. To fill the gap, we sequenced the genomes of four indigenous chickens with distinct morphological traits in southwest China, using a combination of short, long and Hi-C reads. We assembled each genome (~1.0 Gb) into 42 chromosomes with chromosome N50 90.5-90.9 Mb, amongst the highest quality of chicken genome assemblies. To provide resources for gene annotation and functional analysis, we also sequenced transcriptomes of 10 tissues for each of the four chickens. Moreover, we corrected many mis-assemblies and assembled missing micro-chromosomes 29 and 34-39 for GRCg6a.

35525549,Computational tools and resources for pseudokinase research.,"Pseudokinases regulate diverse cellular processes associated with normal cellular functions and disease. They are defined bioinformatically based on the absence of one or more catalytic residues that are required for canonical protein kinase functions. The ability to define pseudokinases based on primary sequence comparison has enabled the systematic mapping and cataloging of pseudokinase orthologs across the tree of life. While these sequences contain critical information regarding pseudokinase evolution and functional specialization, extracting this information and generating testable hypotheses based on integrative mining of sequence and structural data requires specialized computational tools and resources. In this chapter, we review recent advances in the development and application of open-source tools and resources for pseudokinase research. Specifically, we describe the application of an interactive data analytics framework, KinView, for visualizing the patterns of conservation and variation in the catalytic domain motifs of pseudokinases and evolutionarily related canonical kinases using a consistent set of curated alignments organized based on the widely used kinome evolutionary hierarchy. We also demonstrate the application of an integrated Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) and an interactive viewer, ProtVista, for mapping and analyzing primary sequence motifs and annotations in the context of 3D structures and AlphaFold2 models.

Numerous databases are available for miR target prediction and validation, but their functionality is varied, and outputs are not standardized. The purpose of this review is to identify and describe databases for cataloging validated miR targets. Using Tools4miRs and PubMed, we identified databases with experimentally validated targets, human data, and a focus on miR-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions. Data were extracted about the number of times each database was cited, the number of miRs, the target genes, the interactions per database, experimental methodology and key features of each database. The search yielded 10 databases, which in order of most cited to least were: miRTarBase, starBase/The Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes, DIANA-TarBase, miRWalk, miRecords, miRGator, miRSystem, miRGate, miRSel and targetHub. Findings from this review suggest that the information presented within miR target validation databases can be enhanced by adding features such as flexibility in performing queries in multiple ways, downloadable data, ongoing updates and integrating tools for further miR-mRNA target interaction analysis.

The in-depth discussion extends to including material dependence discussion and parameter value selections. After robust validation of the ML method, we have produced an extensive IMFP database for 12 039 narrow bandgap inorganic compounds.

The rapid mutation rate of PRRSV presents a significant challenge in developing an effective vaccine. Even though surveillance and intervention studies have recently (2019) unveiled utilization of PRRSV glycoprotein 5 (GP5; encoded by <i>ORF5</i> gene) to induce immunogenic reaction and production of neutralizing antibodies in porcine populations, the future viral generations can accrue escape mutations. In this study we identify 63 porcine-PRRSV protein-protein interactions which play primary or ancillary roles in viral entry and infection. Using genome-proteome annotation, protein structure prediction, multiple docking experiments, and binding energy calculations, we identified a list of 75 epitope locations on PRRSV proteins crucial for infection. Additionally, using machine learning-based diffusion model, we designed 56 stable immunogen peptides that contain one or more of these epitopes with their native tertiary structures stabilized through optimized N- and C-terminus flank sequences and interspersed with appropriate linker regions.

36475880,A Novel and Efficient Platform for Discovering Noncanonical Quorum-Quenching Proteins.,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a well-known chemical signaling system responsible for intercellular communication that is widespread in bacteria. Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) is the most-studied QS signal. Previously, bacterially encoded AHL-degrading enzymes were considered to be canonical quorum-quenching proteins that have been widely used to control pathogenic infections. Here, we report a novel platform that enabled the efficient discovery of noncanonical AHL quorum-quenching proteins. This platform initially asked bacteriologists to carry out comparative genomic analyses between phylogenetically related AHL-producing and non-AHL-producing members to identify genes that are conservatively shared by non-AHL-producing members but absent in AHL-producing species. These candidate genes were then introduced into recombinant AHL-producing E. coli to screen for target proteins with the ability to block AHL production. Via this platform, we found that non-AHL-producing <i>Lysobacter</i> containing numerous environmentally ubiquitous members encoded a conserved glycosyltransferase-like protein Le4759, which was experimentally shown to be a noncanonical AHL-quenching protein. Le4759 could not directly degrade exogenous AHL but rather recognized and altered the activities of multiple AHL synthases through protein-protein interactions. This versatile capability enabled Le4759 to block specific AHL synthase such as CarI from Pectobacterium carotovorum to reduce its protein abundance to suppress AHL synthesis, thereby impairing bacterial infection. Thus, this study provided bacteriologists with a unique platform to discover noncanonical quorum-quenching proteins that could be developed as promising next-generation drug candidates to overcome emerging bacterial antibiotic resistance. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Targeting and blocking bacterial quorum sensing (QS), the process known as quorum quenching (QQ) is an effective mean to control bacterial infection and overcome the emerging antibiotic resistance. Previously, diverse QS signal-degradation enzymes are identified as canonical QQ proteins. Here, we provided a novel and universal platform that enabled to discover previously unidentified noncanonical QQ proteins that were unable to degrade acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) but could block AHL generation by recognizing multiple AHL synthases via direct protein-protein interactions. Our findings are believed to trigger broad interest for bacteriologists to identify potentially widely distributed noncanonical QQ proteins that have great potential for developing next-generation anti-infectious drugs.",False,True,,0.6316,,ahl | cari,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

38327382,Documenting Mantodea species in South African museum collections and an updated species list.,"<h4>Background</h4>The previous species list of South African Mantodea, published in 1998, was largely compiled from the literature and did not incorporate data from the many insect museum collections available in the country. It is estimated that approximately 120 species of Mantodea occur in South Africa; however, since no historical museum records were previously incorporated, the current information is considered to be outdated and not a true reflection of the Mantodea fauna within this region. A checklist of species is an important benchmark for any insect group, especially in light of the worldwide declines of insect diversity reported over the last decade. Checklists that provide accurate information on insect diversity, especially for groups, such as the Mantodea which could be under threat and thus could provide important information that can be used in determining the threat status of species, as well as to aid in their conservation in general.<h4>New information</h4>This paper provides an updated checklist of the praying mantids (Insecta, Mantodea) species of South Africa. While 120 species were previously reported to occur in South Africa, this paper reports 157 species in 64 genera that represent eight different superfamilies, 14 families and 22 subfamilies. Additionally, five species are reported for the first time to occur in South Africa. This species list was generated from the approximately 4000 specimen records of which 3558 records reside within South Africa. The remaining 732 records represent 14 other African countries. Occurrence records from two citizen-science platforms (iNaturalist and Gbif.org), were also incorporated in this study, adding 1880 species records in South Africa.

Cybertwin-enabled edge computing has become a logical way to satisfy the enormous user demands. However, there are drawbacks to this advancement as well. The effective distribution of resources while balancing the demands for computing, communication, and caching is a major problem in edge networks. The resource allocation problem in dynamic edge computing systems is too complex to address with traditional statistical optimization techniques. Therefore, a Joint Resource allocation method using Self-Organized Map (SOM)-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is proposed for cybertwin-enabled 6G wired + wireless (hybrid) networks. This approach controls the clustering capabilities of SOM to organize the state space, followed by the decision-making strength of RL to select optimal actions for resource allocation in dynamic and real-time environments. The objective is to minimize overall latency and energy consumption. From the results analysis, using SOM-DRL, the hybrid network model outperforms the wireless-only model in terms of latency and energy consumption than the existing MATD3 method by achieves 3.34% of energy consumption, 3.17% of latency, and 7.30% of completion time.",False,True,,0.6641132,som)-based deep reinforcement learning,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Even though S. coelicolor has an outstanding variety of regulators among bacteria, little effort to globally study its transcription has been made. We manually curated 29 years of literature and databases to assemble a meta-curated experimentally-validated gene regulatory network (GRN) with 5386 genes and 9707 regulatory interactions (~ 41% of the total expected interactions). This provides the most extensive and up-to-date reconstruction available for the regulatory circuitry of this organism.

Further, we contrasted the structural properties and functional architecture of the networks to assess the reliability of the predictions, finding the inference from DNA sequence data to be the most trustworthy approach. Finally, we show two applications of the inferred and the curated networks.

Research efforts have so far been directed to improving GWAS techniques rather than on making the results of GWAS interoperable with other genomic signals; this is currently hindered by the use of heterogeneous formats and uncoordinated experiment descriptions.<h4>Results</h4>To practically facilitate integrative use, we propose to include GWAS datasets within the META-BASE repository, exploiting an integration pipeline previously studied for other genomic datasets that includes several heterogeneous data types in the same format, queryable from the same systems. We represent GWAS SNPs and metadata by means of the Genomic Data Model and include metadata within a relational representation by extending the Genomic Conceptual Model with a dedicated view. To further reduce the gap with the descriptions of other signals in the repository of genomic datasets, we perform a semantic annotation of phenotypic traits. Our pipeline is demonstrated using two important data sources, initially organized according to different data models: the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and FinnGen (University of Helsinki). The integration effort finally allows us to use these datasets within multi-sample processing queries that respond to important biological questions. These are then made usable for multi-omic studies together with, e.g., somatic and reference mutation data, genomic annotations, epigenetic signals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As a result of the our work on GWAS datasets, we enable 1) their interoperable use with several other homogenized and processed genomic datasets in the context of the META-BASE repository; 2) their big data processing by means of the GenoMetric Query Language and associated system.

However, the prediction accuracy for most available models trained on the records of chemical reactions without specifying the enzymatic catalysts is rather limited. In this study, we introduced BEC-Pred, a BERT-based multiclassification model, for predicting EC numbers associated with reactions. Leveraging transfer learning, our approach achieves precise forecasting across a wide variety of Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers solely through analysis of the SMILES sequences of substrates and products. BEC-Pred model outperformed other sequence and graph-based ML methods, attaining a higher accuracy of 91.6%, surpassing them by 5.5%, and exhibiting superior F1 scores with improvements of 6.6% and 6.0%, respectively. The enhanced performance highlights the potential of BEC-Pred to serve as a reliable foundational tool to accelerate the cutting-edge research in synthetic biology and drug metabolism.

An in situ mesocosm called Coral Reef Arks is used as a platform to test control interventions and refine the approach. Four field experiments using Coral Reef Arks show how control interventions are used to alter ecological and environmental conditions and guide reef state factors towards desired targets. The results from these tests identify control interventions and parameter relationships that are integrated into predictive models to determine the scale at which to intervene on natural reefs.

The key link prediction setting of prediction window length is specifically examined in the context of a time-sliced evaluation methodology.<h4>Methods</h4>We propose a four-stage approach to explore literature-based discovery for Alzheimer's Disease, creating and analyzing a knowledge graph tailored to the AD context, and predicting and evaluating new knowledge based on time-sliced link prediction. The first stage is to collect an AD-specific corpus. The second stage involves constructing an AD knowledge graph with identified AD-specific concepts and relations from the corpus. In the third stage, 20 pairs of training and testing datasets are constructed with the time-slicing methodology. Finally, we infer new knowledge with graph embedding-based link prediction methods. We compare different link prediction methods in this context. The impact of limiting prediction evaluation of LBD models in the context of short-term and longer-term knowledge evolution for Alzheimer's Disease is assessed.<h4>Results</h4>We constructed an AD corpus of over 16 k papers published in 1977-2021, and automatically annotated it with concepts and relations covering 11 AD-specific semantic entity types. The knowledge graph of Alzheimer's Disease derived from this resource consisted of ∼11 k nodes and ∼394 k edges, among which 34% were genotype-phenotype relationships, 57% were genotype-genotype relationships, and 9% were phenotype-phenotype relationships. A Structural Deep Network Embedding (SDNE) model consistently showed the best performance in terms of returning the most confident set of link predictions as time progresses over 20 years. A huge improvement in model performance was observed when changing the link prediction evaluation setting to consider a more distant future, reflecting the time required for knowledge accumulation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neural network graph-embedding link prediction methods show promise for the literature-based discovery context, although the prediction setting is extremely challenging, with graph densities of less than 1%. Varying prediction window length on the time-sliced evaluation methodology leads to hugely different results and interpretations of LBD studies.

39638559,An integrative TAD catalog in lymphoblastoid cell lines discloses the functional impact of deletions and insertions in human genomes.,"The human genome is packaged within a three-dimensional (3D) nucleus and organized into structural units known as compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and loops. TAD boundaries, separating adjacent TADs, have been found to be well conserved across mammalian species and more evolutionarily constrained than TADs themselves. Recent studies show that structural variants (SVs) can modify 3D genomes through the disruption of TADs, which play an essential role in insulating genes from outside regulatory elements' aberrant regulation. However, how SV affects the 3D genome structure and their association among different aspects of gene regulation and candidate <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements (cCREs) have rarely been studied systematically. Here, we assess the impact of SVs intersecting with TAD boundaries by developing an integrative Hi-C analysis pipeline, which enables the generation of an in-depth catalog of TADs and TAD boundaries in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to fill the gap of limited resources. Our catalog contains 18,865 TADs, including 4596 sub-TADs, with 185 SVs (TAD-SVs) that alter chromatin architecture. By leveraging the ENCODE registry of cCREs in humans, we determine that 34 of 185 TAD-SVs intersect with cCREs and observe significant enrichment of TAD-SVs within cCREs. This study provides a database of TADs and TAD-SVs in the human genome that will facilitate future investigations of the impact of SVs on chromatin structure and gene regulation in health and disease.",False,True,,0.6592614,,encode,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37017258,A reference database of Windows artifacts for file-wiping tool execution analysis.,"Anti-forensic technology can play an effective role in protecting information, but it can make forensic investigations difficult. Specifically, file-wiping permanently erases evidence, making it challenging for investigators to determine whether a file ever existed and prolonging the investigation process. To address this issue, forensic researchers have studied anti-forensic techniques that detect file-wiping activities. Many previous studies have focused on the effects of file-wiping tools on $MFT, $LogFile, and $DATA, rather than on Windows artifacts. Additionally, previous studies that have examined Windows artifacts have considered different artifacts, making it difficult to study them in a comprehensive manner. To address this, we focused on analyzing traces in 13 Windows artifacts of 10 file-wiping tools' operations in the Windows operating system comprehensively. For our experiments, we installed each file-wiping tool on separate virtual machines and checked the traces that the tools left behind in each artifact. We then organized the results in a database format. Our analysis revealed that most of the tools left traces on other artifacts, except for JumpList, Open&SavePidlMRU, and lnk. There were also some cases where traces remained on the other three artifacts. Based on our research, forensic investigators can quickly identify whether a file-wiping tool has been used, and it can assist in decision-making for evidence collection and forensic triage.",False,True,,0.66036,open&savepidlmru,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

While systems that simultaneously recruit multiple distinct 'effector' chromatin regulators can improve efficacy, they generally lack control over effector composition and spatial organisation. To overcome this we have created a modular combinatorial epigenome editing platform, called SSSavi. This system is an interchangeable and reconfigurable docking platform fused to dCas9 that enables simultaneous recruitment of up to four different effectors, allowing precise control of effector composition and spatial ordering. We demonstrate the activity and specificity of the SSSavi system and, by testing it against existing multi-effector targeting systems, demonstrate its comparable efficacy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of the spatial ordering of the recruited effectors for effective transcriptional regulation. Together, the SSSavi system enables exploration of combinatorial effector co-recruitment to enhance manipulation of chromatin contexts previously resistant to targeted editing.",False,True,,0.6915369,,sssavi,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36755230,A prefix and attention map discrimination fusion guided attention for biomedical named entity recognition.,"<h4>Background</h4>The biomedical literature is growing rapidly, and it is increasingly important to extract meaningful information from the vast amount of literature. Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is one of the key and fundamental tasks in biomedical text mining. It also acts as a primitive step for many downstream applications such as relation extraction and knowledge base completion. Therefore, the accurate identification of entities in biomedical literature has certain research value. However, this task is challenging due to the insufficiency of sequence labeling and the lack of large-scale labeled training data and domain knowledge.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we use a novel word-pair classification method, design a simple attention mechanism and propose a novel architecture to solve the research difficulties of BioNER more efficiently without leveraging any external knowledge. Specifically, we break down the limitations of sequence labeling-based approaches by predicting the relationship between word pairs. Based on this, we enhance the pre-trained model BioBERT, through the proposed prefix and attention map dscrimination fusion guided attention and propose the E-BioBERT. Our proposed attention differentiates the distribution of different heads in different layers in the BioBERT, which enriches the diversity of self-attention. Our model is superior to state-of-the-art compared models on five available datasets: BC4CHEMD, BC2GM, BC5CDR-Disease, BC5CDR-Chem, and NCBI-Disease, achieving F1-score of 92.55%, 85.45%, 87.53%, 94.16% and 90.55%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Compared with many previous various models, our method does not require additional training datasets, external knowledge, and complex training process. The experimental results on five BioNER benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model is better at mining semantic information, alleviating the problem of label inconsistency, and has higher entity recognition ability.

36526018,Elastin-like polypeptide-based micelles as a promising platform in nanomedicine.,"New and improved nanomaterials are constantly being developed for biomedical purposes. Nanomaterials based on elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) have increasingly shown potential over the past two decades. These polymers are artificial proteins of which the design is based on human tropoelastin. Due to this similarity, ELP-based nanomaterials are biodegradable and therefore well suited to drug delivery. The assembly of ELP molecules into nanoparticles spontaneously occurs at temperatures above a transition temperature (T<sub>t</sub>). The ELP sequence influences both the T<sub>t</sub> and the physicochemical properties of the assembled nanomaterial. Nanoparticles with desired properties can hence be designed by choosing the appropriate sequence. A promising class of ELP nanoparticles are micelles assembled from amphiphilic ELP diblock copolymers. Such micelles are generally uniform and well defined. Furthermore, site-specific attachment of cargo to the hydrophobic block results in micelles with the cargo shielded inside their core, while conjugation to the hydrophilic block causes the cargo to reside in the corona where it is available for interactions. Such control over particle design is one of the main contributing factors for the potential of ELP-based micelles as a drug delivery system. Additionally, the micelles are easily loaded with protein or peptide-based cargo by expressing it as a fusion protein. Small molecule drugs and other cargo types can be either covalently conjugated to ELP domains or physically entrapped inside the micelle core.

37394429,An Atlas of Variant Effects to understand the genome at nucleotide resolution.,"Sequencing has revealed hundreds of millions of human genetic variants, and continued efforts will only add to this variant avalanche. Insufficient information exists to interpret the effects of most variants, limiting opportunities for precision medicine and comprehension of genome function. A solution lies in experimental assessment of the functional effect of variants, which can reveal their biological and clinical impact. However, variant effect assays have generally been undertaken reactively for individual variants only after and, in most cases long after, their first observation. Now, multiplexed assays of variant effect can characterise massive numbers of variants simultaneously, yielding variant effect maps that reveal the function of every possible single nucleotide change in a gene or regulatory element. Generating maps for every protein encoding gene and regulatory element in the human genome would create an 'Atlas' of variant effect maps and transform our understanding of genetics and usher in a new era of nucleotide-resolution functional knowledge of the genome. An Atlas would reveal the fundamental biology of the human genome, inform human evolution, empower the development and use of therapeutics and maximize the utility of genomics for diagnosing and treating disease.

Treatment of wastewater alone, before disposal, necessitates an excess of energy. Environmental concerns over the use of fossil fuels as a source of energy have prompted a surge in demand for alternative energy sources and the development of sophisticated procedures to extract energy from unconventional sources. Treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater alone accounts for about 3% of global electricity use while the amount of energy embedded in the waste is at least 2-4 times greater than the energy required to treat the same effluent. The microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) is one of the most efficient technologies for waste-to-product conversion that uses electrochemically active bacteria to convert organic matter into hydrogen or a variety of by-products without polluting the environment.

However, current evaluation information relies mainly on the a priori knowledge of decision makers and is subjective and ambiguous. For this reason, a conceptual design solution decision model based on Pythagorean fuzzy sets in a big data environment is proposed. Firstly, we use the ability of big data to mine and analyze information to construct a new standard for product concept design evaluation in the big data environment. Secondly, the Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are integrated into a decision model. AHP, extended by the Pythagorean fuzzy set, is used to determine the weights of new conceptual design criteria in a big data environment. The Pythagorean fuzzy TOPSIS is used to prioritize alternative conceptual design solutions.

40114255,Enriched knowledge representation in biological fields: a case study of literature-based discovery in Alzheimer's disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>In Literature-based Discovery (LBD), Swanson's original ABC model brought together isolated public knowledge statements and assembled them to infer putative hypotheses via logical connections. Modern LBD studies that scale up this approach through automation typically rely on a simple entity-based knowledge graph with co-occurrences and/or semantic triples as basic building blocks. However, our analysis of a knowledge graph constructed for a recent LBD system reveals limitations arising from such pairwise representations, which further negatively impact knowledge inference. Using LBD as the context and motivation in this work, we explore limitations of using pairwise relationships only as knowledge representation in knowledge graphs, and we identify impacts of these limitations on knowledge inference. We argue that enhanced knowledge representation is beneficial for biological knowledge representation in general, as well as for both the quality and the specificity of hypotheses proposed with LBD.<h4>Results</h4>Based on a systematic analysis of one co-occurrence-based LBD system focusing on Alzheimer's Disease, we identify 7 types of limitations arising from the exclusive use of pairwise relationships in a standard knowledge graph-including the need to capture more than two entities interacting together in a single event-and 3 types of negative impacts on knowledge inferred with the graph-Experimentally infeasible hypotheses, Literature-inconsistent hypotheses, and Oversimplified hypotheses explanations. We also present an indicative distribution of different types of relationships. Pairwise relationships are an essential component in representation frameworks for knowledge discovery. However, only 20% of discoveries are perfectly represented with pairwise relationships alone. 73% require a combination of pairwise relationships and nested relationships. The remaining 7% are represented with pairwise relationships, nested relationships, and hypergraphs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We argue that the standard entity pair-based knowledge graph, while essential for representing basic binary relations, results in important limitations for comprehensive biological knowledge representation and impacts downstream tasks such as proposing meaningful discoveries in LBD. These limitations can be mitigated by integrating more semantically complex knowledge representation strategies, including capturing collective interactions and allowing for nested entities. The use of more sophisticated knowledge representation will benefit biological fields with more expressive knowledge graphs. Downstream tasks, such as LBD, can benefit from richer representations as well, allowing for generation of implicit knowledge discoveries and explanations for disease diagnosis, treatment, and mechanism that are more biologically meaningful.",False,True,,0.6355383,,lbd,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Enriched knowledge representation in biological fields,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

37542147,A microfluidic platform for the controlled synthesis of architecturally complex liquid crystalline nanoparticles.,"Soft-matter nanoparticles are of great interest for their applications in biotechnology, therapeutic delivery, and in vivo imaging. Underpinning this is their biocompatibility, potential for selective targeting, attractive pharmacokinetic properties, and amenability to downstream functionalisation. Morphological diversity inherent to soft-matter particles can give rise to enhanced functionality. However, this diversity remains untapped in clinical and industrial settings, and only the simplest of particle architectures [spherical lipid vesicles and lipid/polymer nanoparticles (LNPs)] have been routinely exploited. This is partially due to a lack of appropriate methods for their synthesis. To address this, we have designed a scalable microfluidic hydrodynamic focusing (MHF) technology for the controllable, rapid, and continuous production of lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) nanoparticles (both cubosomes and hexosomes), colloidal dispersions of higher-order lipid assemblies with intricate internal structures of 3-D and 2-D symmetry. These particles have been proposed as the next generation of soft-matter nano-carriers, with unique fusogenic and physical properties. Crucially, unlike alternative approaches, our microfluidic method gives control over LLC size, a feature we go on to exploit in a fusogenic study with model cell membranes, where a dependency of fusion on particle diameter is evident. We believe our platform has the potential to serve as a tool for future studies involving non-lamellar soft nanoparticles, and anticipate it allowing for the rapid prototyping of LLC particles of diverse functionality, paving the way toward their eventual wide uptake at an industrial level.",False,True,,0.67671764,,llc,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

The increasing usage of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within a network has contributed to the rise of network intrusion issues due to malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Generally, malicious URLs are initiated to promote scams, attacks, and frauds which can lead to high-risk intrusion. Several methods have been developed to detect malicious URLs in previous works. There has been a good amount of work done to detect malicious URLs using various methods such as random forest, regression, LightGBM, and more as reported in the literature. However, most of the previous works focused on the binary classification of malicious URLs and are tested on limited URL datasets. Nevertheless, the detection of malicious URLs remains a challenging task that remains open to research. Hence, this work proposed a stacking-based ensemble classifier to perform multi-class classification of malicious URLs on larger URL datasets to justify the robustness of the proposed method. This study focuses on obtaining lexical features directly from the URL to identify malicious websites. Then, the proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier is developed by integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, hyperparameter tuning was performed using the Randomized Search method to optimize the proposed classifier. The proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier aims to take advantage of the performance of each machine learning model and aggregate the output to improve prediction accuracy.

Gene-targeted therapies are being developed at a fast pace and have started entering clinical trials. In light of these developments, building a global network of centers working on monogenic PD, fostering collaborative research, and establishing a clinical trial-ready cohort is imperative. Based on a systematic review of the English literature on monogenic PD and a successful team science approach, we have built up a network of 59 sites worldwide and have collected information on the availability of data, biomaterials, and facilities. To enable access to this resource and to foster collaboration across centers, as well as between academia and industry, we have developed an interactive map and online tool allowing for a quick overview of available resources, along with an option to filter for specific items of interest. This initiative is currently being merged with the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), which will attract additional centers with a focus on underrepresented sites.

38443673,A new R package to parse plant species occurrence records into unique collection events efficiently reduces data redundancy.,"Biodiversity data aggregators, such as Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) suffer from inflation of the number of occurrence records when data from different databases are merged but not fully reconciled. The ParseGBIF workflow is designed to parse duplicate GBIF species occurrence records into unique collection events (gatherings) and to optimise the quality of the spatial data associated with them. ParseGBIF provides tools to verify and standardize species scientific names according to the World Checklist of Vascular Plants taxonomic backbone, and to parse duplicate records into unique 'collection events', in the process compiling the most informative spatial data, where more than one duplicate is available, and providing crude estimates of taxonomic and spatial data quality. When GBIF occurrence records for a medium-sized vascular plant family, the Myrtaceae, were processed by ParseGBIF, the average number of records useful for spatial analysis increased by 180%. ParseGBIF could therefore be valuable in the evaluation of species' occurrences at the national scale in support for national biodiversity plans, identification of plant areas important for biodiversity, sample bias estimation to inform future sampling efforts, and to forecast species range shifts in response to global climate change.",False,True,,0.70570153,global biodiversity information facility | parsegbif,gbif,6.0,conflict,gbif | global biodiversity information facility,,,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1

We utilize a nano-LC to ensure minimal volumes and surfaces although any LC can be coupled. The setup operates as a high-pH fractionation system capable of effectively working with nanogram scales of lysate digests. The 2D RP-RP system demonstrated superior proteome coverage over single-shot data-dependent acquisition (DDA) analysis using only 5 ng of human cell lysate digest with performance increasing with increasing amounts of material. We found that the fractionation system allowed over 60% signal recovery at the peptide level and, more importantly, we observed improved protein level intensity coverage, which indicates the complexity reduction afforded by the system outweighs the sample losses endured. The application of data-independent acquisition (DIA) and wide window acquisition (WWA) to fractionated samples allowed nearly 8000 proteins to be identified from 50 ng of the material. The utility of the 2D system was further investigated for phosphoproteomics (>21 000 phosphosites from 50 μg starting material) and pull-down type experiments and showed substantial improvements over single-shot experiments. We show that the 2D RP-RP system is a highly versatile and powerful tool for many proteomics workflows.",False,True,,0.66557056,2d rp-rp system demonstrated superior proteome coverage over single-shot data-dependent acquisition,dda,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1

In this project, we focused on the national Red List, a catalog of extinct and threatened species, issued by the Japanese government. We combined the data included in it with the record of genome assembly in NCBI and tabulated the assembly availability of the species in the list. The combined data shows a low percentage (2.1%) of the availability of whole genome sequence data for the taxa ranked on the Japanese Red List as well as a strong bias towards mammals and birds in Animalia and vascular plants in Plantae.

40213365,Unveiling the structural and functional implications of uncharacterized NSPs and variations in the molecular toolkit across arteriviruses.,"Despite considerable scrutiny of mammalian arterivirus genomes, their genomic architecture remains incomplete, with several unannotated non-structural proteins (NSPs) and the enigmatic absence of methyltransferase (MTase) domains. Additionally, the host range of arteriviruses has expanded to include seven newly sequenced genomes from non-mammalian hosts, which remain largely unannotated and await detailed comparisons alongside mammalian isolates. Utilizing comparative genomics approaches and comprehensive sequence-structure analysis, we provide enhanced genomic architecture and annotations for arterivirus genomes. We identified the previously unannotated C-terminal domain of NSP3 as a winged helix-turn-helix domain and classified NSP7 as a new small β-barrel domain, both likely involved in interactions with viral RNA. NSP12 is identified as a derived variant of the N7-MTase-like Rossmann fold domain that retains core structural alignment with N7-MTases in Nidovirales but likely lacks enzymatic functionality due to the erosion of catalytic residues, indicating a unique role specific to mammalian arteriviruses. In contrast, non-mammalian arteriviruses sporadically retain a 2'-O-MTase and an exonuclease (ExoN) domain, which are typically absent in mammalian arteriviruses, highlighting contrasting evolutionary trends and variations in their molecular toolkit. Similar lineage-specific patterns are observed in the diversification of papain-like proteases and structural proteins.

However, the need for a machine-readable drug product library which consolidates many aspects of formulation design and performance remains largely unmet. This study presents a scripted, reproducible approach to database curation and explores its potential to streamline oral medicine development. The Product Information files for all centrally authorized drug products containing a small molecule active ingredient were retrieved programmatically from the European Medicines Agency Web site. Text processing isolated relevant information, including the maximum clinical dose, dosage form, route of administration, excipients, and pharmacokinetic performance. Chemical and bioactivity data were integrated through automated linking to external curated databases. The capability of this database to inform oral medicine development was assessed in the context of drug-likeness evaluation, excipient selection, and prediction of oral fraction absorbed. Existing filters of drug-likeness, such as the Rule of Five, were found to poorly capture the chemical space of marketed oral drug products. Association rule learning identified frequent patterns in tablet formulation compositions that can be used to establish excipient combinations that have seen clinical success. Binary prediction models of oral fraction absorbed constructed exclusively from regulatory data achieved acceptable performance (balanced accuracy<sub>test</sub> = 0.725), demonstrating its modelability and potential for use during early stage molecule prioritization tasks.

In this study, 2D basin-scale numerical simulations were carried out on the COMSOL Multiphysics<sup>®</sup> finite element numerical platform to identify non-renewable water resources in the Central Pannonian Basin (Central Europe, Hungary) based on the lack of hydraulic connection to recharge areas. The concept and boundary conditions (fixed water table configuration at the top, pressure-elevation profiles on the lateral sides, and constant pressure on the bottom) were derived from a previous basin-scale hydraulic data evaluation study, while the hydrostratigraphic subdivision was based on seismic and well log interpretations. As a result, topography-driven groundwater flow systems fed by meteoric water infiltration were separated from a transition zone, which contains non-renewable groundwater resources and covers 85% area of the simulated 110 km long and roughly 1600 m deep cross-section what was previously thought to be fully renewable.

The far-reaching consequences of online harassment require immediate preventative steps to safeguard psychological wellness and scholarly achievement via detection at an earlier stage. This piece of writing aims to eliminate online harassment and create a criticism-free online environment. In the paper, we have used a variety of attributes to evaluate a large number of Bengali comments. We communicate cleansed data utilizing machine learning (ML) methods and natural language processing techniques, which must be followed using term frequency and reverse document frequency (TF-IDF) with a count vectorizer. In addition, we used tokenization with padding to feed our deep learning (DL) models. Using mathematical visualization and natural language processing, online bullying could be detected quickly.

Some clusters are present across all stages of larval development, while others are stage specific (such as developing adult neurons). We identify genes that are differentially expressed in each cluster, as well as genes that are differentially expressed at distinct stages of larval life. These differentially expressed genes provide promising candidates for regulating the function of specific neuronal and glial types in the larval nervous system, or the specification and differentiation of adult neurons.

40197252,"Putting health facilities on the map: a renewed call to create geolocated, comprehensive, updated, openly licensed dataset of health facilities in sub-Saharan African countries.","<h4>Background</h4>Healthcare service provision, planning, and management depend on the availability of a geolocated, up-to-date, comprehensive health facility database (HFDB) to adequately meet a population's healthcare needs. HFDBs are an integral component of national health system infrastructure forming the basis of efficient health service delivery, planning, surveillance, and ensuring equitable resource distribution, response to epidemics and outbreaks, as well as for research. Despite the value of HFDBs, their availability remains a challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Many SSA countries face challenges in creating a HFDB; existing facility lists are incomplete, lack geographical coordinates, or contain outdated information on facility designation, service availability, or capacity. Even in countries with a HFDB, it is often not available open-access to health system stakeholders. Consequently, multiple national and subnational parallel efforts attempt to construct HFDBs, resulting in duplication and lack of governmental input, use, and validation.<h4>Main body</h4>In this paper, we advocate for a harmonized SSA-wide HFDB. To achieve this, we elaborate on the steps required and challenges to overcome. We provide an overview of the minimum attributes of a HFDB and discuss past and current efforts to collate HFDBs at the country and regional (SSA) levels. We contend that a complete HFDB should include administrative units, geographic coordinates of facilities, attributes of service availability and capacity, facilities from both public and private sectors, be updated regularly, and be available to health system stakeholders through an open access policy. We provide historical and recent examples while looking at key issues and challenges, such as privacy, legitimacy, resources, and leadership, which must be considered to achieve such HFDBs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A harmonized HFDB for all SSA countries will facilitate efficient healthcare planning and service provision. A continental, cross-border effort will further support planning during natural disasters, conflicts, and migration. This is only achievable if there is a regional commitment from countries and health system stakeholders to open data sharing. This SSA-wide HFDB should be a government-led initiative with contributions from all stakeholders, ensuring no one is left behind in the pursuit of improved health service provision and universal health coverage.",False,True,,0.6217101,,hfdb,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Putting health facilities on the map,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
38771886,Large language model based framework for automated extraction of genetic interactions from unstructured data.,"Extracting biological interactions from published literature helps us understand complex biological systems, accelerate research, and support decision-making in drug or treatment development. Despite efforts to automate the extraction of biological relations using text mining tools and machine learning pipelines, manual curation continues to serve as the gold standard. However, the rapidly increasing volume of literature pertaining to biological relations poses challenges in its manual curation and refinement. These challenges are further compounded because only a small fraction of the published literature is relevant to biological relation extraction, and the embedded sentences of relevant sections have complex structures, which can lead to incorrect inference of relationships. To overcome these challenges, we propose GIX, an automated and robust Gene Interaction Extraction framework, based on pre-trained Large Language models fine-tuned through extensive evaluations on various gene/protein interaction corpora including LLL and RegulonDB. GIX identifies relevant publications with minimal keywords, optimises sentence selection to reduce computational overhead, simplifies sentence structure while preserving meaning, and provides a confidence factor indicating the reliability of extracted relations. GIX's Stage-2 relation extraction method performed well on benchmark protein/gene interaction datasets, assessed using 10-fold cross-validation, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. We demonstrated that the proposed method, although fully automated, performs as well as manual relation extraction, with enhanced robustness. We also observed GIX's capability to augment existing datasets with new sentences, incorporating newly discovered biological terms and processes.

The special transient hermaphroditic stage makes the little yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) an appealing model for studying hermaphrodite formation. However, the origin and evolutionary relationship between of L. polyactis and Larimichthys crocea, the most famous commercial fish species in East Asia, remain unclear. Here, we report the sequence of the L. polyactis genome, which we found is ~706 Mb long (contig N50 = 1.21 Mb and scaffold N50 = 4.52 Mb) and contains 25,233 protein-coding genes. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that L. polyactis diverged from the common ancestor, L. crocea, approximately 25.4 million years ago. Our high-quality genome assembly enabled comparative genomic analysis, which revealed several within-chromosome rearrangements and translocations, without major chromosome fission or fusion events between the two species. The dmrt1 gene was identified as the male-specific gene in L. polyactis. Transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of dmrt1 and its upstream regulatory gene (rnf183) were both sexually dimorphic. Rnf183, unlike its two paralogues rnf223 and rnf225, is only present in Larimichthys and Lates but not in other teleost species, suggesting that it originated from lineage-specific duplication or was lost in other teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the hermaphrodite stage in male L. polyactis may be explained by the sequence evolution of dmrt1.

39738593,A geometric neural solving method based on a diagram text information fusion analysis.,"The long-standing problem of geometric problem solving in artificial intelligence education has attracted widespread attention. It is necessary to combine geometry diagrams and text descriptions to form a logical representation. This involves combining the knowledge of mathematical theorems, generating a solution sequence, and executing to obtain the answer. However, deficiencies in the feature extraction of geometry diagrams and the fusion of diagram text information can lead to poor performance in solving geometry problems. To effectively extract geometry diagram features, this study proposes an improved diagram parser DenseNet, and enhances the semantic representation of cross-modal information by adding auxiliary tasks. A structural and semantic pre-training strategy was used to parse the text description to avoid different problem solving schemes due to subtle differences in the interpretation of text content. Information fusion was realized by connecting the two modal labels, and then the information was sent to the encoder for fusion. The geometric knowledge was generated under the guidance of multi-modal information, and these programs were executed to obtain the results. Additionally, the performance of the proposed geometric neural solution method on the PGPS9K dataset is improved by 1.3% on average.

39230709,Improving dictionary-based named entity recognition with deep learning.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Dictionary-based named entity recognition (NER) allows terms to be detected in a corpus and normalized to biomedical databases and ontologies. However, adaptation to different entity types requires new high-quality dictionaries and associated lists of blocked names for each type. The latter are so far created by identifying cases that cause many false positives through manual inspection of individual names, a process that scales poorly.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we aim to improve block list s by automatically identifying names to block, based on the context in which they appear. By comparing results of three well-established biomedical NER methods, we generated a dataset of over 12.5 million text spans where the methods agree on the boundaries and type of entity tagged. These were used to generate positive and negative examples of contexts for four entity types (genes, diseases, species, and chemicals), which were used to train a Transformer-based model (BioBERT) to perform entity type classification. Application of the best model (F1-score = 96.7%) allowed us to generate a list of problematic names that should be blocked. Introducing this into our system doubled the size of the previous list of corpus-wide blocked names. In addition, we generated a document-specific list that allows ambiguous names to be blocked in specific documents. These changes boosted text mining precision by ∼5.5% on average, and over 8.5% for chemical and 7.5% for gene names, positively affecting several biological databases utilizing this NER system, like the STRING database, with only a minor drop in recall (0.6%).<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All resources are available through Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11243139 and GitHub https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10289360.",False,True,,0.7074536,transformer | biobert,string,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11243139 | https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10289360,,False,,1
35724625,Evaluating hierarchical machine learning approaches to classify biological databases.,"The rate of biological data generation has increased dramatically in recent years, which has driven the importance of databases as a resource to guide innovation and the generation of biological insights. Given the complexity and scale of these databases, automatic data classification is often required. Biological data sets are often hierarchical in nature, with varying degrees of complexity, imposing different challenges to train, test and validate accurate and generalizable classification models. While some approaches to classify hierarchical data have been proposed, no guidelines regarding their utility, applicability and limitations have been explored or implemented. These include 'Local' approaches considering the hierarchy, building models per level or node, and 'Global' hierarchical classification, using a flat classification approach. To fill this gap, here we have systematically contrasted the performance of 'Local per Level' and 'Local per Node' approaches with a 'Global' approach applied to two different hierarchical datasets: BioLip and CATH. The results show how different components of hierarchical data sets, such as variation coefficient and prediction by depth, can guide the choice of appropriate classification schemes. Finally, we provide guidelines to support this process when embarking on a hierarchical classification task, which will help optimize computational resources and predictive performance.",False,True,,0.6941808,,cath,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39787917,Leveraging Transformers-based models and linked data for deep phenotyping in radiology.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>Despite significant investments in the normalization and the standardization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), free text is still the rule rather than the exception in clinical notes. The use of free text has implications in data reuse methods used for supporting clinical research since the query mechanisms used in cohort definition and patient matching are mainly based on structured data and clinical terminologies. This study aims to develop a method for the secondary use of clinical text by: (a) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for tagging clinical notes with biomedical terminology; and (b) designing an ontology that maps and classifies all the identified tags to various terminologies and allows for running phenotyping queries.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Transformers-based NLP Models, concretely pre-trained RoBERTa language models, were used to process radiology reports and annotate them identifying elements matching UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) definitions. CUIs were mapped into several biomedical ontologies useful for phenotyping (e.g., SNOMED-CT, HPO, ICD-10, FMA, LOINC, and ICPC2, among others) and represented as a lightweight ontology using OWL (Web Ontology Language) constructs. This process resulted in a Linked Knowledge Base (LKB), which allows running expressive queries to retrieve reports that comply with specific criteria using automatic reasoning.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Although phenotyping tools mostly rely on relational databases, the combination of NLP and Linked Data technologies allows us to build scalable knowledge bases using standard ontologies from the Web of data.

38084013,Assessing computational tools for predicting protein stability changes upon missense mutations using a new dataset.,"Insight into how mutations affect protein stability is crucial for protein engineering, understanding genetic diseases, and exploring protein evolution. Numerous computational methods have been developed to predict the impact of amino acid substitutions on protein stability. Nevertheless, comparing these methods poses challenges due to variations in their training data. Moreover, it is observed that they tend to perform better at predicting destabilizing mutations than stabilizing ones. Here, we meticulously compiled a new dataset from three recently published databases: ThermoMutDB, FireProtDB, and ProThermDB. This dataset, which does not overlap with the well-established S2648 dataset, consists of 4038 single-point mutations, including over 1000 stabilizing mutations. We assessed these mutations using 27 computational methods, including the latest ones utilizing mega-scale stability datasets and transfer learning. We excluded entries with overlap or similarity to training datasets to ensure fairness. Pearson correlation coefficients for the tested tools ranged from 0.20 to 0.53 on unseen data, and none of the methods could accurately predict stabilizing mutations, even those performing well in anti-symmetric property analysis. While most methods present consistent trends for predicting destabilizing mutations across various properties such as solvent exposure and secondary conformation, stabilizing mutations do not exhibit a clear pattern. Our study also suggests that solely addressing training dataset bias may not significantly enhance accuracy of predicting stabilizing mutations. These findings emphasize the importance of developing precise predictive methods for stabilizing mutations.",False,True,,0.6003538,thermomutdb | fireprotdb | prothermdb,,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

There are problems such as poor anti-interference ability and insufficient real-time online analysis of production data. This paper adopts the dual-chip control system architecture based on ""ARM+DSP"", starting from the mechanical characteristics and operating signal features of the pole mill. The hardware system adopts a three-unit joint control hardware structure, which separates the control unit from the data processing unit and improves the operation of the system. The software system adopts fuzzy PID algorithm to realize deflection control and tension control, and verifies that the Fuzzy PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) control algorithm can effectively improve the anti-interference ability of the deflection system and tension system. The results show that the data loss rate is low with the SPI communication between DSP and ARM. The tension error of the ""ARM+DSP"" control system does not exceed 5%, and the deviation of the correction band is within ±4mm. The dedicated dual-chip hardware architecture effectively improves the robustness and operation efficiency of the pole mill, solves the problem of low tension control accuracy, and provides a theoretical basis for the application of the dual-roll mill.",False,True,,0.6122901,digital signal processing,arm | dsp | pid | spi,6.0,conflict,dsp | digital signal processing,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Environmental stresses occur in combination, with advancements in crop tolerance further complicated by its polygenic nature. Strategic targeting of causal genes is required to meet future crop production needs. Here, we employed a systems biology approach in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to investigate physio-metabolic adjustments and transcriptome reprogramming involved in acclimations to heat, drought, salinity and all combinations therein. A significant shift in magnitude and complexity of plant response was evident across stress scenarios based on the agronomic losses, increased proline concentrations and 8.7-fold increase in unique differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) observed under the triple stress condition. Transcriptome data from all stress treatments were assembled into an online, open access eFP browser for visualizing gene expression during abiotic stress. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed 152 hub genes of which 32% contained the ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) transcriptional repression motif. Cross-referencing against the 31 DETs common to all stress treatments isolated TaWRKY33 as a leading candidate for greater plant tolerance to combinatorial stresses. Integration of our findings with available literature on gene functional characterization allowed us to further suggest flexible gene combinations for future adaptive gene stacking in wheat.

39870154,Indian cryogenebank conserving diverse plant genetic resources for the last three decades: Achievements and way forward.,"Ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR) plays a crucial role in sustainable growth and development, as highlighted by the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). Seed genebanks, a key component of ex situ conservation, have been instrumental in preserving plant diversity. However, challenges arise with the conservation of non-orthodox (recalcitrant and intermediate) seeds and vegetative tissues, which are not amenable to storage in traditional genebanks at temperatures of -20 °C. Cryopreservation, the storage of biological materials at ultra-low temperatures in liquid nitrogen, has emerged as a viable solution for conserving such non-orthodox seeds, pollen, and dormant buds. This review presents insights into the National Cryogenebank Facility at ICAR-NBPGR, India, a pioneer in developing cryopreservation techniques and cryobanking of PGR. Established in 1987, the facility focuses on conserving difficult-to-conserve species of various agri-horticultural crops, including recalcitrant and intermediate species. With a capacity to hold a quarter of a million samples, the facility employs species-specific protocols to conserve rare, threatened, and endangered plant species, wild and weedy crop relatives, and genetic stocks. Over the past 3 decades, cryopreservation protocols have been developed at this facility using a diverse range of explants, including seeds, excised embryos, embryonic axes, pollen grains, and dormant buds. Successful cryopreservation protocols have been developed for temperate and tropical plant species important for horticultural, plantation, agro-forestry, and industrial use. Priority is given to conserving indigenous crop species and capturing the genetic diversity of indigenous tropical and temperate major and minor fruits. Additionally, the facility has successfully conserved pollen grains and dormant buds of tropical and temperate fruit crops, ensuring their viability and survival over extended periods of cryostorage. Furthermore, the cryobank regularly retests cryostored germplasm to assess viability and regrowth, with promising results indicating retention of seed viability even after 25-30 years of cryostorage. This highlights the potential of cryobanking as a long-term solution for conserving plant genetic resources.

The PFAS family encompasses diverse classes, with only a fraction being commercially relevant. These substances are found in the environment, including in water sources, soil, and wildlife, leading to human exposure and fueling concerns about potential human health impacts. Although PFAS degradation is challenging, biodegradation offers a promising, eco-friendly solution. Biodegradation has been effective for a variety of organic contaminants but is yet to be successful for PFAS due to a paucity of identified microbial species capable of transforming these compounds. Recent studies have investigated PFAS biotransformation and fluoride release; however, the number of specific microorganisms and enzymes with demonstrable activity with PFAS remains limited. This review discusses enzymes that could be used in PFAS metabolism, including haloacid dehalogenases, reductive dehalogenases, cytochromes P450, alkane and butane monooxygenases, peroxidases, laccases, desulfonases, and the mechanisms of microbial resistance to intracellular fluoride.

Inspired by nature's wettability patterns, we developed a biomimetic fern leaf pesticide collection patch using laser-induced graphene (LIG) alongside an external electrochemical LIG biosensor. This ""collect-and-sense"" system allows for rapid pesticide spray monitoring in the farm field. The LIG is synthesized and patterned on polyimide through a high-throughput gantry-based CO<sub>2</sub> laser process, making it amenable to scalable manufacturing. The resulting LIG-based leaf exhibits a remarkable water collection capacity, harvesting spray mist/fog at a rate approximately 11 times greater than a natural ostrich fern leaf when the collection is normalized to surface area. The developed three-electrode LIG pesticide biosensor, featuring a working electrode functionalized with electrodeposited platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and the enzyme glycine oxidase, displayed a linear range of 10-260 μM, a detection limit of 1.15 μM, and a sensitivity of 5.64 nA μM<sup>-1</sup> for the widely used herbicide glyphosate. Also, a portable potentiostat with a user-friendly interface was developed for remote operation, achieving an accuracy of up to 97%, when compared to a standard commercial benchtop potentiostat. The LIG ""collect-and-sense"" system can consistently collect and monitor glyphosate spray after 24-48 hours of spraying, a time that corresponds to the restricted-entry interval required to enter most farm fields after pesticide spraying.

OMVs can be purified from bacterial culture supernatants, and by genetically manipulating the bacterial cells that produce them, they can be engineered to harbor cargoes and/or display molecules of interest on their surfaces including antigens that are immunogenic in mammals. Since OMV bilayer-embedded components presumably maintain their native structures, OMVs may represent highly useful tools for generating antibodies to bacterial outer membrane targets. OMVs have historically been utilized as vaccines or vaccine constituents. Antibodies that target bacterial surfaces are increasingly being explored as antimicrobial agents either in unmodified form or as targeting moieties for bactericidal compounds.

37904728,Rational design of the genetic code expansion toolkit for <i>in vivo</i> encoding of D-amino acids.,"Once thought to be non-naturally occurring, D-amino acids (DAAs) have in recent years been revealed to play a wide range of physiological roles across the tree of life, including in human systems. Synthetic biologists have since exploited DAAs' unique biophysical properties to generate peptides and proteins with novel or enhanced functions. However, while peptides and small proteins containing DAAs can be efficiently prepared <i>in vitro</i>, producing large-sized heterochiral proteins poses as a major challenge mainly due to absence of pre-existing DAA translational machinery and presence of endogenous chiral discriminators. Based on our previous work demonstrating pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase's (PylRS') remarkable substrate polyspecificity, this work attempts to increase PylRS' ability in directly charging tRNA<sup>Pyl</sup> with D-phenylalanine analogs (DFAs). We here report a novel, polyspecific <i>Methanosarcina mazei</i> PylRS mutant, DFRS2, capable of incorporating DFAs into proteins via ribosomal synthesis <i>in vivo</i>.

This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel two-level optimization model aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and robustness in smart distribution grids. The model synergistically integrates renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and demand-side management through a dynamic reconfiguration approach. It employs a robust optimization framework combined with a two-stage second-order cone optimization model to manage real-time operations and strategic grid reconfiguration. Key findings from simulations on the IEEE 33 and 69-bus networks underscore the model's effectiveness. In the 33-bus system, implementing the demand response program led to a significant reduction in power losses, from 0.64 MW to 0.52 MW, and improved voltage stability, with the minimum voltage increasing from 0.970 to 0.980 p.u. Similarly, in the 69-bus system, power losses decreased from 0.85 MW to 0.79 MW, and voltage stability improved, with the minimum voltage rising from 0.962 to 0.972 p.u.

So far, several computational tools have been created to address this task. Nevertheless, most of them have been trained or optimized on the same and 'all' available data, making a fair comparison unfeasible. Here, we introduce a novel dataset, collected and manually cleaned from the latest version of the ThermoMutDB database, consisting of 669 variants not included in the most widely used training datasets. The prediction performance and the ability to satisfy the antisymmetry property by considering both direct and reverse variants were evaluated across 21 different tools. The Pearson correlations of the tested tools were in the ranges of 0.21-0.5 and 0-0.45 for the direct and reverse variants, respectively. When both direct and reverse variants are considered, the antisymmetric methods perform better achieving a Pearson correlation in the range of 0.51-0.62. The tested methods seem relatively insensitive to the physiological conditions, performing well also on the variants measured with more extreme pH and temperature values. A common issue with all the tested methods is the compression of the $\Delta \Delta G$ predictions toward zero. Furthermore, the thermodynamic stability of the most significantly stabilizing variants was found to be more challenging to predict.

Accurate prediction of plant phosphorylation sites (p-sites) is vital as abnormal regulation of phosphorylation usually leads to plant diseases. However, current experimental methods for PTM prediction suffers from high-computational cost and are error-prone. The present study develops machine learning-based prediction techniques, including a high-performance interpretable deep tabular learning network (TabNet) to improve the prediction of protein p-sites in soybean. Moreover, we use a hybrid feature set of sequential-based features, physicochemical properties and position-specific scoring matrices to predict serine (Ser/S), threonine (Thr/T) and tyrosine (Tyr/Y) p-sites in soybean for the first time. The experimentally verified p-sites data of soybean proteins are collected from the eukaryotic phosphorylation sites database and database post-translational modification. We then remove the redundant set of positive and negative samples by dropping protein sequences with >40% similarity. It is found that the developed techniques perform >70% in terms of accuracy. The results demonstrate that the TabNet model is the best performing classifier using hybrid features and with window size of 13, resulted in 78.96 and 77.24% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The results indicate that the TabNet method has advantages in terms of high-performance and interpretability. The proposed technique can automatically analyze the data without any measurement errors and any human intervention. Furthermore, it can be used to predict putative protein p-sites in plants effectively.

For this purpose, protocols for extracting high-molecular-weight DNA using nonhazardous, inexpensive reagents and equipment are needed, and some methods have been developed for gram-negative bacteria. However, we found that without modification, these protocols are unsuitable for gram-positive Streptococcus spp., a major threat to fish farming and food security in low- and middle-income countries. Multiple approaches were evaluated, and the most effective was an extraction method using lysozyme, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and proteinase K for lysis of bacterial cells and magnetic beads for DNA recovery. We optimized the method to consistently achieve sufficient yields of pure high-molecular-weight DNA with minimal reagents and time and developed a version of the protocol which can be performed without a centrifuge or electrical power. The suitability of the method was verified by MinION sequencing and assembly of 12 genomes of epidemiologically diverse fish-pathogenic Streptococcus iniae and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. The combination of effective high-molecular-weight DNA extraction and MinION sequencing enabled the discovery of a naturally occurring 15 kb low-copy number mobilizable plasmid in S. iniae, which we name pSI1.

34890150,Reconciling Signaling Pathway Databases with Network Topologies.,"A major goal of molecular systems biology is to understand the coordinated function of genes or proteins in response to cellular signals and to understand these dynamics in the context of disease. Signaling pathway databases such as KEGG, NetPath, NCI-PID, and Panther describe the molecular interactions involved in different cellular responses. While the same pathway may be present in different databases, prior work has shown that the particular proteins and interactions differ across database annotations. However, to our knowledge no one has attempted to quantify their structural differences. It is important to characterize artifacts or other biases within pathway databases, which can provide a more informed interpretation for downstream analyses. In this work we consider signaling pathways as graphs and we use topological measures to study their structure. We find that topological characterization using graphlets (small, connected subgraphs) distinguishes signaling pathways from appropriate null models of interaction networks. Next, we quantify topological similarity across pathway databases. Our analysis reveals that the pathways harbor database-specific characteristics implying that even though these databases describe the same pathways, they tend to be systematically different from one another. We show that pathway-specific topology can be uncovered after accounting for database-specific structure. This work presents the first step towards elucidating common pathway structure beyond their specific database annotations.Data Availability: https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/pathway-reconciliation.",False,True,,0.7108393,netpath,kegg | pid,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,https://github.com/Reed-CompBio/pathway-reconciliation,,False,,1

Although their feeding habits have not been studied with experimental protocols, it is traditionally assumed that they are omnivorous.The genus <i>Enchodelus</i> has not been recently revised; descriptions of many 'old species' (that have been described long ago and have not been reported since their original discovery) are of poor quality, hardly discoverable and do not conform to the nowadays taxonomical standards. Thus, a comprehensive compilation and analysis of their literature data is indispensable to provide new insights into the taxonomy of the genus and to elucidate its evolutionary relationships.<h4>New information</h4>This contribution provides a cyber catalogue of all <i>Enchodelus</i> species, 28 in total.

Finally, the performance of the platform was validated through the analysis of the EGFR L858R mutation in lung cancer. The proposed three-in-one ddPCR platform shows great practicability in ultrasensitive nucleic acid testing.

35758780,Exploring automatic inconsistency detection for literature-based gene ontology annotation.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Literature-based gene ontology annotations (GOA) are biological database records that use controlled vocabulary to uniformly represent gene function information that is described in the primary literature. Assurance of the quality of GOA is crucial for supporting biological research. However, a range of different kinds of inconsistencies in between literature as evidence and annotated GO terms can be identified; these have not been systematically studied at record level. The existing manual-curation approach to GOA consistency assurance is inefficient and is unable to keep pace with the rate of updates to gene function knowledge. Automatic tools are therefore needed to assist with GOA consistency assurance. This article presents an exploration of different GOA inconsistencies and an early feasibility study of automatic inconsistency detection.<h4>Results</h4>We have created a reliable synthetic dataset to simulate four realistic types of GOA inconsistency in biological databases. Three automatic approaches are proposed. They provide reasonable performance on the task of distinguishing the four types of inconsistency and are directly applicable to detect inconsistencies in real-world GOA database records. Major challenges resulting from such inconsistencies in the context of several specific application settings are reported.

36299577,A resource scheduling method for reliable and trusted distributed composite services in cloud environment based on deep reinforcement learning.,"With the vigorous development of Internet technology, applications are increasingly migrating to the cloud. Cloud, a distributed network environment, has been widely extended to many fields such as digital finance, supply chain management, and biomedicine. In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of the modern biomedical industry, the biological cloud platform is an inevitable choice for the integration and analysis of medical information. It improves the work efficiency of the biological information system and also realizes reliable and credible intelligent processing of biological resources. Cloud services in bioinformatics are mainly for the processing of biological data, such as the analysis and processing of genes, the testing and detection of human tissues and organs, and the storage and transportation of vaccines. Biomedical companies form a data chain on the cloud, and they provide services and transfer data to each other to create composite services. Therefore, our motivation is to improve process efficiency of biological cloud services. Users' business requirements have become complicated and diversified, which puts forward higher requirements for service scheduling strategies in cloud computing platforms. In addition, deep reinforcement learning shows strong perception and continuous decision-making capabilities in automatic control problems, which provides a new idea and method for solving the service scheduling and resource allocation problems in the cloud computing field. Therefore, this paper designs a composite service scheduling model under the containers instance mode which hybrids reservation and on-demand. The containers in the cluster are divided into two instance modes: reservation and on-demand. A composite service is described as a three-level structure: a composite service consists of multiple services, and a service consists of multiple service instances, where the service instance is the minimum scheduling unit. In addition, an improved Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm is proposed and applied to the scheduling algorithm of composite services. The experimental results show that applying our improved DQN algorithm to the composite services scheduling problem in the container cloud environment can effectively reduce the completion time of the composite services.

In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing of Kam Sweet Rice (KSR), a valuable, rare, and ancient rice landrace unique to the Dong people. Through comparative genomic analyses of KSR and other rice landraces from south of the Yangtze River Basin in China, we provide evidence that the ancestors of the Dong people likely originated from the southeast coast of China at least 1000 years ago. Alien introgression and admixture in KSR demonstrated multiple migration events in the history of the Dong people. Genomic footprints of domestication demonstrated characteristics of KSR that arose from artificial selection and geographical adaptation by the Dong people. The key genes GS3, Hd1, and DPS1 (related to agronomic traits) and LTG1 and MYBS3 (related to cold tolerance) were identified as domestication targets, reflecting crop improvement and changes in the geographical environment of the Dong people during migration. A genome-wide association study revealed a candidate yield-associated gene, Os01g0923300, a specific haplotype in KSR that is important for regulating grain number per panicle. RNA-sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR results showed that this gene was more highly expressed in KSR than in ancestral populations, indicating that it may have great value in increasing yield potential in other rice accessions.

This study addresses this critical need by developing a novel approach for live cell imaging in U-87/HUF co-culture spheroids. We introduce water-soluble, biocompatible red carbon dots (R-CDs) exhibiting exceptional stability and brightness (21% quantum yield) specifically designed for imaging within these 3D models. Furthermore, we designed a microfluidic chip with ellipsoid-shaped microwells to efficiently generate two distinct co-culture spheroid types: direct mixing and core-shell. R-CDs enabled non-invasive tracking of U-87 cancer cell location within these 3D models demonstrating their efficacy for long-term monitoring of live cells in cancer research.

38708311,Decoding the gene-disease associations in type 2 diabetes: A curated dataset for text mining-based classification.,"Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) exerts a substantial impact on mortality rates. According to 2023 statistics, more than half a billion individuals are experiencing the effects of T2D, making it one of the top 10 leading contributors to worldwide deaths. Multiple factors contribute to the onset of T2D, such as obesity, poor diet and lifestyle, the mutation in specific genes and many more. Among the various factors that contribute to the development of T2D, genetics is a pivotal aspect. Due to the significant influence of genes in the initiation and advancement of various phases of T2D, our focus lies on exploring the association between T2D and genes. In the present article, we have curated Standard disease gene association data which contains evidence or reference sentences which contain this disease gene association information, which is further classified into 4 classes: Yes, No, Ambiguous and X each pertaining to Positive, Negative, Ambiguous and Not related disease-gene associations respectively. For the purpose of this work, we downloaded T2D related abstracts from PubMed using EDirect and further pre-processed this abstract data to extract Reference Sentences Data. This data was later double-fold manually validated to compile this disease gene association data. The data produced in this article serves as reference data for the training text mining-based biological literature classifiers. Classifiers will further be used to predict classes of published literature, not just for T2D, but can also be expanded beyond to encompass a wide range of disease and their complications. The compilation of positively linked genes derived from these predictions can then be utilized for in-depth system-level analysis of T2D.",False,True,,0.6946188,,t2d.,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Decoding the gene-disease associations in type diabetes,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

38855791,"﻿An annotated catalogue of selected historical type specimens, including genetic data, housed in the Natural History Museum Vienna.","Museum collections are an important source for resolving taxonomic issues and species delimitation. Type specimens as name-bearing specimens, traditionally used in morphology-based taxonomy, are, due to the progress in historical DNA methodology, increasingly used in molecular taxonomic studies. Museum collections are subject to constant deterioration and major disasters. The digitisation of collections offers a partial solution to these problems and makes museum collections more accessible to the wider scientific community. The Extended Specimen Approach (ESA) is a method of digitisation that goes beyond the physical specimen to include the historical information stored in the collection. The collections of the Natural History Museum Vienna represent one of the largest non-university research centres in Europe and, due to their size and numerous type specimens, are frequently used for taxonomic studies by visiting and resident scientists. Recently, a version of ESA was presented in the common catalogue of the Fish and Evertebrata Varia collections and extended to include genetic information on type specimens in a case study of a torpedo ray. Here the case study was extended to a heterogeneous selection of historical type series from different collections with the type locality of Vienna. The goal was to apply the ESA, including genetic data on a selected set of type material: three parasitic worms, three myriapods, two insects, twelve fishes, and one bird species. Five hundred digital items (photographs, X-rays, scans) were produced, and genetic analysis was successful in eleven of the 21 type series. In one case a complete mitochondrial genome was assembled, and in another case ten short fragments (100-230 bp) of the cytochrome oxidase I gene were amplified and sequenced. For five type series, genetic analysis confirmed their taxonomic status as previously recognised synonyms, and for one the analysis supported its status as a distinct species. For two species, genetic information was provided for the first time. This catalogue thus demonstrates the usefulness of ESA in providing digitised data of types that can be easily made available to scientists worldwide for further study.",False,True,,0.6377167,,esa,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36267181,Inference of pan-cancer related genes by orthologs matching based on enhanced LSTM model.,"Many disease-related genes have been found to be associated with cancer diagnosis, which is useful for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer, generating targeted drugs, and developing new diagnostic and treatment techniques. With the development of the pan-cancer project and the ongoing expansion of sequencing technology, many scientists are focusing on mining common genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across various cancer types. In this study, we attempted to infer pan-cancer associated genes by examining the microbial model organism Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Yeast) by homology matching, which was motivated by the benefits of reverse genetics. First, a background network of protein-protein interactions and a pathogenic gene set involving several cancer types in humans and yeast were created. The homology between the human gene and yeast gene was then discovered by homology matching, and its interaction sub-network was obtained. This was undertaken following the principle that the homologous genes of the common ancestor may have similarities in expression. Then, using bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) in combination with adaptive integration of heterogeneous information, we further explored the topological characteristics of the yeast protein interaction network and presented a node representation score to evaluate the node ability in graphs. Finally, homologous mapping for human genes matched the important genes identified by ensemble classifiers for yeast, which may be thought of as genes connected to all types of cancer. One way to assess the performance of the BiLSTM model is through experiments on the database. On the other hand, enrichment analysis, survival analysis, and other outcomes can be used to confirm the biological importance of the prediction results.

39134412,A gene regulatory network-aware graph learning method for cell identity annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data.,"Cell identity annotation for single-cell transcriptome data is a crucial process for constructing cell atlases, unraveling pathogenesis, and inspiring therapeutic approaches. Currently, the efficacy of existing methodologies is contingent upon specific data sets. Nevertheless, such data are often sourced from various batches, sequencing technologies, tissues, and even species. Notably, the gene regulatory relationship remains unaffected by the aforementioned factors, highlighting the extensive gene interactions within organisms. Therefore, we propose scHGR, an automated annotation tool designed to leverage gene regulatory relationships in constructing gene-mediated cell communication graphs for single-cell transcriptome data. This strategy helps reduce noise from diverse data sources while establishing distant cellular connections, yielding valuable biological insights. Experiments involving 22 scenarios demonstrate that scHGR precisely and consistently annotates cell identities, benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, scHGR uncovers novel subtypes within peripheral blood mononuclear cells, specifically from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, by characterizing a cell atlas comprising 56 cell types for COVID-19 patients, scHGR identifies vital factors like IL1 and calcium ions, offering insights for targeted therapeutic interventions.",False,True,,0.70027983,automated annotation | regulatory relationships,schgr,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39576796,Optimizing makespan and resource utilization in cloud computing environment via evolutionary scheduling approach.,"As a new computing resources distribution platform, cloud technology greatly influenced society with the conception of on-demand resource usage through virtualization technology. Virtualization technology allows physical resource usage in a way that will enable multiple end-users to have similar hardware infrastructure. In the cloud, many challenges exist on the provider side due to the expectations of clients. Resource scheduling (RS) is the most significant nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) hard problem in the cloud, owing to its crucial impact on cloud performance. Previous research found that metaheuristics can dramatically increase CC performance if deployed as scheduling algorithms. Therefore, this study develops an evolutionary algorithm-based scheduling approach for makespan optimization and resource utilization (EASA-MORU) technique in the cloud environment. The EASA-MORU technique aims to maximize the makespan and effectively use the resources in the cloud infrastructure. In the EASA-MORU technique, the dung beetle optimization (DBO) technique is used for scheduling purposes. Moreover, the EASA-MORU technique balances the load properly and distributes the resources based on the demands of the cloud infrastructure. The performance evaluation of the EASA-MORU method is tested using a series of performance measures.

However, their valuable diversity also created heterogeneity, which poses challenges to optimally exploit their richness.<h4>Methods</h4>In this opinion review, we analyse catalogues for human subject research ranging from cohort studies to surveillance, administrative and healthcare records.<h4>Results</h4>We observe that while these catalogues are heterogeneous, have various scopes, and use different terminologies, still the underlying concepts seem potentially harmonizable. We propose a unified framework to enable catalogue data sharing, with catalogues of multi-center cohorts nested as a special case in catalogues of real-world data sources. Moreover, we list recommendations to create an integrated community of metadata catalogues and an open catalogue ecosystem to sustain these efforts and maximise impact.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We propose to embrace the autonomy of motivated catalogue teams and invest in their collaboration via minimal standardisation efforts such as clear data licensing, persistent identifiers for linking same records between catalogues, minimal metadata 'common data elements' using shared ontologies, symmetric architectures for data sharing (push/pull) with clear provenance tracks to process updates and acknowledge original contributors.

39134617,Building a learnable universal coordinate system for single-cell atlas with a joint-VAE model.,"A universal coordinate system that can ensemble the huge number of cells and capture their heterogeneities is of vital importance for constructing large-scale cell atlases as references for molecular and cellular studies. Studies have shown that cells exhibit multifaceted heterogeneities in their transcriptomic features at multiple resolutions. This nature of complexity makes it hard to design a fixed coordinate system through a combination of known features. It is desirable to build a learnable universal coordinate model that can capture major heterogeneities and serve as a controlled generative model for data augmentation. We developed UniCoord, a specially-tuned joint-VAE model to represent single-cell transcriptomic data in a lower-dimensional latent space with high interpretability. Each latent dimension can represent either discrete or continuous feature, and either supervised by prior knowledge or unsupervised. The latent dimensions can be easily reconfigured to generate pseudo transcriptomic profiles with desired properties. UniCoord can also be used as a pre-trained model to analyze new data with unseen cell types and thus can serve as a feasible framework for cell annotation and comparison. UniCoord provides a prototype for a learnable universal coordinate framework to enable better analysis and generation of cells with highly orchestrated functions and heterogeneities.",False,True,,0.7194454,unicoord,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
35136947,Proteoform identification based on top-down tandem mass spectra with peak error corrections.,"In this paper, we study the problem for finding complex proteoforms from protein databases based on top-down tandem mass spectrum data. The main difficulty to solve the problem is to handle the combinatorial explosion of various alterations on a protein. To overcome the combinatorial explosion of various alterations on a protein, the problem has been formulated as the alignment problem of a proteoform mass graph (PMG) and a spectrum mass graph (SMG). The other important issue is to handle mass errors of peaks in the input spectrum. In previous methods, an error tolerance value is used to handle the mass differences between the matched consecutive nodes/peaks in PMG and SMG. However, such a way to handle mass error can not guarantee that the mass difference between any pairs of nodes in the alignment is approximately the same for both PMG and SMG. It may lead to large error accumulation if positive (or negative) errors occur consecutively for a large number of consecutive matched node pairs. The problem is severe so that some existing software packages include a step to further refine the alignments. In this paper, we propose a new model to handle the mass errors of peaks based on the formulation of the PMG and SMG. Note that the masses of sub-paths on the PMG are theoretical and suppose to be accurate. Our method allows each peak in the input spectrum to have a predefined error range. In the alignment of PMG and SMG, we need to give a correction of the mass for each matched peak within the predefined error range. After the correction, we impose that the mass between any two (not necessarily consecutive) matched nodes in the PMG is identical to that of the corresponding two matched peaks in the SMG. Intuitively, this kind of alignment is more accurate. We design an algorithm to find a maximum number of matched node and peak pairs in the two (PMG and SMG) mass graphs under the new constraint. The obtained alignment can show matched node and peak pairs as well as the corrected positions of peaks. The algorithm works well for moderate size input instances and takes very long time as well as huge size memory for large input size instances. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to do diagonal alignment. The diagonal alignment algorithm can solve large input size instances in reasonable time. Experiments show that our new algorithms can report alignments with much larger number of matched node pairs.

We applied target-enrichment to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes of marine ichthyofauna from the Brazilian coast selected based on economic significance, conservation status and lack of phylogenetically-close references. These included sardines (Dorosomatidae, Alosidae), mackerels (Scombridae) croakers (Sciaenidae), groupers (Epinephelidae) and snappers (Lutjanidae).<h4>Results</h4>Custom baits were designed to enrich mitochondrial DNA across a broad phylogenetic range of fishes. Sequencing generated approximately 100k reads per sample, which were assembled in a total of 70 complete mitochondrial genomes and include fifty-two new additions to GenBank, including five species with no previous mitochondrial data. Departures from the typical gene content and order occurred in only three taxa and mostly involved tRNA gene duplications. Start-codons for all genes, except Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COI), were consistently ATG, whilst a wide range of stop-codons deviated from the prevailing TAA. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed assembly accuracy and revealed signs of cryptic diversification within the Mullus genus. Lineage delimitation methods using Sardinella aurita and S. brasiliensis mitochondrial genomes support a single Operational Taxonomic Unit.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Target enrichment was highly efficient, providing complete novel mitochondrial genomes with little sequencing effort.

The designed proteins contain α-helix ligands that do not require any covalent chemical modification, do not have frayed ends, and importantly can make sterically favorable interactions similar to isolated peptides. An optimal mPIH showed a more than 100-fold increase in target selectivity, which might be related to the advantages in conformational selection due to the absence of frayed ends. The α-helical ligand in the mPIH displayed high thermal stability well above human body temperature and showed reversible and rapid folding/unfolding transitions. Thus, mPIH can become a promising protein-based platform for developing stabilized α-helix pharmaceuticals.",False,True,,0.66662025,,mpih,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Abortion of spikelet primordia within individual barley spikes causes a 30%-50% loss in the potential number of grains during development from the awn primordium stage to the tipping stage, after that grain filling is the primary factor regulating grain size. To identify transcriptional signatures associated with spike development, we use a six-rowed barley cultivar (Morex) to develop a spatiotemporal transcriptome atlas containing 255 samples covering 17 stages and 5 positions along the spike. We identify several fundamental regulatory networks, in addition to key regulators of spike development and morphology.

36759776,Model performance and interpretability of semi-supervised generative adversarial networks to predict oncogenic variants with unlabeled data.,"<h4>Background</h4>It remains an important challenge to predict the functional consequences or clinical impacts of genetic variants in human diseases, such as cancer. An increasing number of genetic variants in cancer have been discovered and documented in public databases such as COSMIC, but the vast majority of them have no functional or clinical annotations. Some databases, such as CiVIC are available with manual annotation of functional mutations, but the size of the database is small due to the use of human annotation. Since the unlabeled data (millions of variants) typically outnumber labeled data (thousands of variants), computational tools that take advantage of unlabeled data may improve prediction accuracy.<h4>Result</h4>To leverage unlabeled data to predict functional importance of genetic variants, we introduced a method using semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN), incorporating features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Our SGAN model incorporated features from clinical guidelines and predictive scores from other computational tools. We also performed comparative analysis to study factors that influence prediction accuracy, such as using different algorithms, types of features, and training sample size, to provide more insights into variant prioritization. We found that SGAN can achieve competitive performances with small labeled training samples by incorporating unlabeled samples, which is a unique advantage compared to traditional machine learning methods. We also found that manually curated samples can achieve a more stable predictive performance than publicly available datasets.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By incorporating much larger samples of unlabeled data, the SGAN method can improve the ability to detect novel oncogenic variants, compared to other machine-learning algorithms that use only labeled datasets. SGAN can be potentially used to predict the pathogenicity of more complex variants such as structural variants or non-coding variants, with the availability of more training samples and informative features.",False,True,,0.6652242,,cosmic | sgan,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

We investigate how partitioning transfer RNA (tRNA) resources by incorporating dissimilar codon usage can drastically alter interdependence of expression level and burden on the host. By isolating the effect of individual codons' use during translation elongation while eliminating confounding factors, we show that codon choice can trans-regulate fitness of the host and expression of other heterologous or native genes.

Taking its advantage of fascinating properties, such as high structure defects and good conductivity, graphdiyne is prepared and used to prepare high-performance enzyme biofuel cell.

37529914,"Multi-task prediction-based graph contrastive learning for inferring the relationship among lncRNAs, miRNAs and diseases.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Identifying the relationships among long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and diseases is highly valuable for diagnosing, preventing, treating and prognosing diseases. The development of effective computational prediction methods can reduce experimental costs. While numerous methods have been proposed, they often to treat the prediction of lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs), miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) and lncRNA-miRNA interactions (LMIs) as separate task. Models capable of predicting all three relationships simultaneously remain relatively scarce. Our aim is to perform multi-task predictions, which not only construct a unified framework, but also facilitate mutual complementarity of information among lncRNAs, miRNAs and diseases.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised embedding method called graph contrastive learning for multi-task prediction (GCLMTP). Our approach aims to predict LDAs, MDAs and LMIs by simultaneously extracting embedding representations of lncRNAs, miRNAs and diseases. To achieve this, we first construct a triple-layer lncRNA-miRNA-disease heterogeneous graph (LMDHG) that integrates the complex relationships between these entities based on their similarities and correlations. Next, we employ an unsupervised embedding model based on graph contrastive learning to extract potential topological feature of lncRNAs, miRNAs and diseases from the LMDHG. The graph contrastive learning leverages graph convolutional network architectures to maximize the mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of the LMDHG. Subsequently, for the three prediction tasks, multiple classifiers are explored to predict LDA, MDA and LMI scores. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two datasets (from older and newer versions of the database, respectively). The results show that GCLMTP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for the disease-related lncRNA and miRNA prediction tasks. Additionally, case studies on two datasets further demonstrate the ability of GCLMTP to accurately discover new associations.

This approach innovates by utilizing attribute information on miRNAs and drugs instead of relying on the commonly used interaction graph information. Specifically, considering the sequence lengths of miRNAs and drugs, DLST-MDA employs multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn sequence embeddings at different granularity levels from miRNA and drug sequences. Additionally, it leverages the power of graph neural networks to capture structural information from drug molecular graphs, providing a more representational analysis of the drug features. To evaluate DLST-MDA's effectiveness, we manually constructed a benchmark data set for various experiments based on the latest databases. Results indicate that DLST-MDA performs better than other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, case studies of three common anticancer drugs can evidence their usefulness in discovering novel MDAs.

39741946,Cataloging metagenome-assembled genomes and microbial genes from the athlete gut microbiome.,"<b>Aim:</b> Exercise has been increasingly recognized as a potential influencer of the gut microbiome. Nevertheless, findings remain incongruous, particularly in relation to sport-specific patterns. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we harness all publicly available data from athlete gut microbiome shotgun studies to explore how exercise may influence the gut microbiota through metagenomic assembly supplemented with short read-based taxonomic profiling. Through this analysis, we provide insights into exercise-associated taxa and genes, including the identification and annotation of putative novel species from the analysis of approximately 2,000 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), classified as high-quality (HQ) MAGs and assembled as part of this investigation. <b>Results:</b> Our metagenomic analysis unveiled potential athlete-associated microbiome patterns at both the phylum and species levels, along with their associated microbial genes, across a diverse array of sports and individuals. Specifically, we identified 76 species linked to exercise, with a notable prevalence of the <i>Firmicutes</i> phylum. Furthermore, our analysis detected MAGs representing potential novel species across various phyla, including <i>Bacteroidota</i>, <i>Candidatus Melainabacteria</i>, <i>Elusimicrobia</i>, <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Lentisphaerae</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, <i>Tenericutes</i>, and <i>Verrucomicrobiota</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> In summary, this catalog of MAGs and their corresponding genes stands as the most extensive collection yet compiled from athletes. Our analysis has discerned patterns in genes associated with exercise.

38922750,A genome catalogue of mercury-methylating bacteria and archaea from sediments of a boreal river facing human disturbances.,"Methyl mercury, a toxic compound, is produced by anaerobic microbes and magnifies in aquatic food webs, affecting the health of animals and humans. The exploration of mercury methylators based on genomes is still limited, especially in the context of river ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a genome catalogue of potential mercury-methylating microorganisms. This was based on the presence of hgcAB from the sediments of a river affected by two run-of-river hydroelectric dams, logging activities and a wildfire. Through the use of genome-resolved metagenomics, we discovered a unique and diverse group of mercury methylators. These were dominated by members of the metabolically versatile Bacteroidota and were particularly rich in microbes that ferment butyrate. By comparing the diversity and abundance of mercury methylators between sites subjected to different disturbances, we found that ongoing disturbances, such as the input of organic matter related to logging activities, were particularly conducive to the establishment of a mercury-methylating niche. Finally, to gain a deeper understanding of the environmental factors that shape the diversity of mercury methylators, we compared the mercury-methylating genome catalogue with the broader microbial community. The results suggest that mercury methylators respond to environmental conditions in a manner similar to the overall microbial community. Therefore, it is crucial to interpret the diversity and abundance of mercury methylators within their specific ecological context.",False,True,,0.6114727,,hgcab,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36596235,Controllable Three-Dimensional DNA Nanomachine-Mediated Electrochemical Biosensing Platform for Rapid and Ultrasensitive Detection of MicroRNA.,"In this work, a high-efficiency controllable three-dimensional (3D) DNA nanomachine (CDNM) was reasonably developed by regulating the diameter of the core and the length of the DNAzyme cantilever, which acquired greater amplification efficiency and speedier walking rate than traditional 3D DNA nanomachines with gold nanoparticles as the cores and DNAzymes as the walking arms. Significantly, once the target miRNA-21 existed, a large number of silent DNAzymes on the CDNM could be activated by enzyme-free-target-recycling amplification (EFTRA) to achieve fast cleavage and walking on the biosensor surface under the interaction of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Impressively, when the diameter of the core was 40 nm and the length of the DNAzyme cantilever was 5 nm (15 bp), the CDNM could complete the reaction process in 60 min that was at least twice shorter than those of conventional DNA nanomachines. Moreover, the designed electrochemical biosensor successfully detected target miRNA-21 at an ultrasensitive level with a wide response range (100 aM to 1 nM) and a low detection limit (33.1 aM).

No such database can be complete and it is often necessary to incorporate data from several sources.

This article presents StructRecon, a novel tool for resolving unique molecular structures from database identifiers. Currently, identifiers from BiGG, ChEBI,</b> <i>Escherichia coli</i> Metabolome Database <b>(ECMDB), MetaNetX, and PubChem are supported. StructRecon traverses the cross-links between entries in different databases to construct what we call identifier graphs. The goal of these graphs is to offer a more complete view of the total information available on a given compound across all the supported databases. To reconcile discrepancies met during the traversal of the databases, we develop an extensible model for molecular structure supporting multiple independent levels of detail, which allows standardization of the structure to be applied iteratively. In some cases, our standardization approach results in multiple candidate structures for a given compound, in which case a random walk-based algorithm is used to select the most likely structure among incompatible alternatives. As a case study, we applied StructRecon to the <i>EColiCore2</i> model. We found at least one structure for 98.66% of its compounds, which is more than twice as many as possible when using the databases in more standard ways not considering the complex network of cross-database references captured by our identifier graphs.

A key aspect of gene model annotation is protein-level evidence of gene expression obtained from proteomics studies, followed up by proteogenomics to physically map proteins to the genome. In this research, we have retrieved the largest recent wheat proteomics datasets publicly available and applied the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (tBLASTn) algorithm to map the 861,759 identified unique peptides against IWGSC RefSeq v2.1. Of the 92,719 hits, 83,015 unique peptides aligned along 33,612 High Confidence (HC) genes, thus validating 31.4% of all wheat HC gene models. Furthermore, 6685 unique peptides were mapped against 3702 Low Confidence (LC) gene models, and we argue that these gene models should be considered for HC status. The remaining 2934 orphan peptides can be used for novel gene discovery, as exemplified here on chromosome 4D. We demonstrated that tBLASTn could not map peptides exhibiting mid-sequence frame shift. We supply all our proteogenomics results, Galaxy workflow and Python code, as well as Browser Extensible Data (BED) files as a resource for the wheat community via the Apollo Jbrowse, and GitHub repositories.

In this paper, user clustering and power allocation challenges in the downlink of a multi-carrier NOMA system are investigated, with sum rate as the optimization objective. The paper presents an iterative optimization process, starting with user clustering followed by power allocation of the users. Although the simultaneous transmission for multiple users achieves high system throughput in NOMA, it leads to more energy consumption, which is limited by the battery capacity of IoT devices. Enhancing energy efficiency by considering the QoS requirement is a primary challenge in NOMA-enabled IoT devices. Currently, fixed user clustering techniques are proposed without considering the diversity and heterogeneity of channels, leading to poor throughput performance. The proposed user clustering technique is based on the partial brute force search (P-BFS) method, which reduces complexity compared to the traditional exhaustive search method. After the user clustering, we performed optimal power allocation using the Lagrangian multiplier method with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimal conditions for each user assigned to a subchannel in each cluster. Lastly, a deep neural network (DNN) based proposed P-BFS scheme is used to reduce resource allocation's complexity further.

Recent developments in the field have been marked by an expansion away from purely categorical studies towards a greater investigation of community functionality. As in-depth genomic and environmental coverage is often distributed unequally across major taxa and ecosystems, it can be difficult to identify or substantiate relationships within microbial communities. Generic databases containing datasets from diverse ecosystems have opened a new era of data accessibility despite costs in terms of data quality and heterogeneity. This challenge is readily embodied in the integration of meta-omics data alongside habitat-specific standards which help contextualise datasets both in terms of sample processing and background within the ecosystem. A special case of large genomic repositories, ecosystem-specific databases (ES-DB's), have emerged to consolidate and better standardise sample processing and analysis protocols around individual ecosystems under study, allowing independent studies to produce comparable datasets.

Certain PTM types, such as truncation and oxidation, increase the difficulty of precise proteoform characterization owing to inherent limitations in peptide and intact protein analyses. Top-down MS (TDMS) can resolve this ambiguity via fragmentation of specific proteoforms. We leveraged the strengths of flow-programmed (fp) denaturing online buffer exchange (dOBE) chromatography, including robust automation, relatively high ESI sensitivity, and long MS/MS window time, to support a TDMS platform for industrial protein characterization. We tested data-dependent (DDA) and targeted strategies using 14 different MS/MS scan types featuring combinations of collisional- and electron-based fragmentation as well as proton transfer charge reduction. This large, focused dataset was processed using a new software platform, named TDAcquireX, that improves proteoform characterization through TDMS data aggregation. A DDA-based workflow provided objective identification of αLac truncation proteoforms with a two-termini clipping search.

Understanding how these tasks are engineered relies on delivering external electron donors or acceptors to initiate electron transfer reactions. This is a challenge. Small-molecule redox reagents can act indiscriminately, poisoning the cell. Natural redox proteins are more selective, but finding the right partner can be difficult due to the limited number of redox potentials and difficulty tuning them. <i>De novo</i> proteins offer an alternative path. They are robust and can withstand mutations that allow for tailorable changes. They are also devoid of evolutionary artifacts and readily bind redox cofactors. However, no reliable set of engineering principles have been developed that allow for these proteins to be fine-tuned so their redox midpoint potential (<i>E<sub>m</sub></i>) can form donor/acceptor pairs with any natural oxidoreductase. This work dissects protein-cofactor interactions that can be tuned to modulate redox potentials of acceptors and donors using a mutable <i>de novo</i> designed tetrahelical protein platform with iron tetrapyrrole cofactors as a test case. We show a series of engineered heme <i>b</i>-binding <i>de novo</i> proteins and quantify their resulting effect on <i>E<sub>m</sub></i>. By focusing on the surface charge and buried charges, as well as cofactor placement, chemical modification, and ligation of cofactors, we are able to achieve a broad range of <i>E<sub>m</sub></i> values spanning a range of 330 mV.

The nanochromosome includes a copy of the centromere from K. phaffii chromosome 3, a K. phaffii-derived autonomously replicating sequence on either side of the centromere, and a pair of K. phaffii-like telomeres. It contains, within its q arm, a landing zone in which genes of interest alternate with long (approx. 1-kb) non-coding DNA chosen to facilitate homologous recombination and serve as spacers. The landing zone can be extended along the nanochromosome, in an inch-worming mode of sequential gene integrations, accompanied by recycling of just two antibiotic-resistance markers. The nanochromosome was used to express PDI, a gene encoding protein disulfide isomerase. Co-expression with PDI allowed the production, from a genomically integrated gene, of secreted murine complement factor H, a plasma protein containing 40 disulfide bonds.

The relationships between modules, immune cells, and survival were identified by correlation analysis and survival analysis. A total of 37 stable co-expressed gene modules were identified. These modules were associated with the critical biology process in sepsis. Four modules can independently separate patients with long and short survival. Three modules can recurrently separate sepsis and normal patients with high accuracy. Some modules can separate bacterial pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, mixed bacterial and influenza A pneumonia, and non-infective systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

35368074,An efficient curriculum learning-based strategy for molecular graph learning.,"Computational methods have been widely applied to resolve various core issues in drug discovery, such as molecular property prediction. In recent years, a data-driven computational method-deep learning had achieved a number of impressive successes in various domains. In drug discovery, graph neural networks (GNNs) take molecular graph data as input and learn graph-level representations in non-Euclidean space. An enormous amount of well-performed GNNs have been proposed for molecular graph learning. Meanwhile, efficient use of molecular data during training process, however, has not been paid enough attention. Curriculum learning (CL) is proposed as a training strategy by rearranging training queue based on calculated samples' difficulties, yet the effectiveness of CL method has not been determined in molecular graph learning. In this study, inspired by chemical domain knowledge and task prior information, we proposed a novel CL-based training strategy to improve the training efficiency of molecular graph learning, called CurrMG. Consisting of a difficulty measurer and a training scheduler, CurrMG is designed as a plug-and-play module, which is model-independent and easy-to-use on molecular data. Extensive experiments demonstrated that molecular graph learning models could benefit from CurrMG and gain noticeable improvement on five GNN models and eight molecular property prediction tasks (overall improvement is 4.08%). We further observed CurrMG's encouraging potential in resource-constrained molecular property prediction. These results indicate that CurrMG can be used as a reliable and efficient training strategy for molecular graph learning.

39972011,Facilitating high throughput collections-based genomics: a comparison of DNA extraction and library building methods.,"While DNA barcoding methods are an increasingly important tool in biological conservation, the resource requirements of constructing reference libraries frequently reduce their efficacy. One efficient way of sourcing taxonomically validated DNA for reference libraries is to use museum collections. However, DNA degradation intrinsic to historical museum specimens can, if not addressed in the wet lab, lead to low quality data generation and severely limit scientific output. Several DNA extraction and library build methods that are designed to work with degraded DNA have been developed, although the ability to implement these methods at scale and at low cost has yet to be formally addressed. Here, the performance of widely used DNA extraction and library build methods are compared using museum specimens. We find that while our selected DNA extraction methods do not significantly differ in DNA yield, the Santa Cruz Reaction (SCR) library build method is not only the most effective at retrieving degraded DNA from museum specimens but also easily implemented at high throughput for low cost. Results highlight the importance of lab protocol on data yield.

Accurate identification of antibiotic resistant strains is essential for the control of infection. In the present study, our goal is to leverage the whole-genome data of <i>H. pylori</i> to develop practical and interpretable machine learning (ML) models for comprehensive antibiotic resistance assessment. A total of 296 <i>H. pylori</i> isolates with genome-wide data were downloaded from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. By training ML models on feature sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms from SNP calling (SNPs-1), antibiotic-resistance SNP annotated by the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (SNPs-2), gene presence or absence (GPA), we generated predictive models for four antibiotics and multidrug-resistance (MDR). Among them, the models that combined SNPs-1, SNPs-2, and GPA data demonstrated the best performance, with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) consistently outperforming others. And then we utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the ML models. Furthermore, a free web application for the MDR model was deployed to the GitHub repository (https://H.pylori/MDR/App/).

35892461,Portable Vertical Graphene@Au-Based Electrochemical Aptasensing Platform for Point-of-Care Testing of Tau Protein in the Blood.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term neurodegenerative disease that poses a serious threat to human life and health. It is very important to develop a portable quantitative device for AD diagnosis and personal healthcare. Herein, we develop a portable electrochemical sensing platform for the point-of-care detection of AD biomarkers in the blood. Such a portable platform integrates nanoAu-modified vertical graphene (VG@Au) into a working electrode, which can significantly improve sensitivity and reduce detection limit due to the large specific surface, excellent electrical conductivity, high stability, and good biocompatibility. The tau protein, as an important factor in the course of AD, is selected as a key AD biomarker. The results show that the linear range of this sensing platform is 0.1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.034 pg/mL (S/N = 3), indicating that this portable sensing platform meets the demand for the detection of the tau protein in the blood.

39922957,Decentralized identifiers based IoT data trusted collection.,"The data collection processes of IoT devices face significant security challenges, including access authorization, secure transmission, and secure storage. These challenges are particularly critical in sectors such as smart healthcare, smart homes, and smart cities, where users often lack direct ownership or control over IoT devices. Various solutions have been proposed to address these issues, leveraging technologies such as Certificate Authorities (CAs) and blockchain. However, the CA model is inherently centralized, while blockchain-based solutions suffer from relatively low efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this article introduces a trust model for IoT data collection based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and proposes a novel IoT data security collection scheme, called TrID. TrID employs a distributed architecture to resolve the centralization problem and operates independently of blockchain, significantly enhancing both the security and efficiency of IoT data collection. The experiment shows that the authentication time cost of TrID in the mutual authentication protocol is only 10% of on-chain solutions, and the decryption of 10 MB of data with 1000 KB encrypted block size, requires less than 100 ms.",False,True,,0.6517929,,trid,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39349569,Federated influencer learning for secure and efficient collaborative learning in realistic medical database environment.,"Enhancing deep learning performance requires extensive datasets. Centralized training raises concerns about data ownership and security. Additionally, large models are often unsuitable for hospitals due to their limited resource capacities. Federated learning (FL) has been introduced to address these issues. However, FL faces challenges such as vulnerability to attacks, non-IID data, reliance on a central server, high communication overhead, and suboptimal model aggregation. Furthermore, FL is not optimized for realistic hospital database environments, where data are dynamically accumulated. To overcome these limitations, we propose federated influencer learning (FIL) as a secure and efficient collaborative learning paradigm. Unlike the server-client model of FL, FIL features an equal-status structure among participants, with an administrator overseeing the overall process. FIL comprises four stages: local training, qualification, screening, and influencing. Local training is similar to vanilla FL, except for the optional use of a shared dataset. In the qualification stage, participants are classified as influencers or followers. During the screening stage, the integrity of the logits from the influencer is examined. If the integrity is confirmed, the influencer shares their knowledge with the others. FIL is more secure than FL because it eliminates the need for model-parameter transactions, central servers, and generative models. Additionally, FIL supports model-agnostic training. These features make FIL particularly promising for fields such as healthcare, where maintaining confidentiality is crucial. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of FIL, which outperformed several FL methods on large medical (X-ray, MRI, and PET) and natural (CIFAR-10) image dataset in a dynamically accumulating database environment, with consistently higher precision, recall, Dice score, and lower standard deviation between participants. In particular, in the PET dataset, FIL achieved about a 40% improvement in Dice score and recall.",False,True,,0.66468257,,iid,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
38366548,High-density genetic linkage mapping in Sitka spruce advances the integration of genomic resources in conifers.,"In species with large and complex genomes such as conifers, dense linkage maps are a useful resource for supporting genome assembly and laying the genomic groundwork at the structural, populational, and functional levels. However, most of the 600+ extant conifer species still lack extensive genotyping resources, which hampers the development of high-density linkage maps. In this study, we developed a linkage map relying on 21,570 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis [Bong.] Carr.), a long-lived conifer from western North America that is widely planted for productive forestry in the British Isles. We used a single-step mapping approach to efficiently combine RAD-seq and genotyping array SNP data for 528 individuals from 2 full-sib families. As expected for spruce taxa, the saturated map contained 12 linkages groups with a total length of 2,142 cM. The positioning of 5,414 unique gene coding sequences allowed us to compare our map with that of other Pinaceae species, which provided evidence for high levels of synteny and gene order conservation in this family. We then developed an integrated map for P. sitchensis and Picea glauca based on 27,052 markers and 11,609 gene sequences. Altogether, these 2 linkage maps, the accompanying catalog of 286,159 SNPs and the genotyping chip developed, herein, open new perspectives for a variety of fundamental and more applied research objectives, such as for the improvement of spruce genome assemblies, or for marker-assisted sustainable management of genetic resources in Sitka spruce and related species.",False,True,,0.6312542,,cm.,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Diversified target sequences and customized editing products call for base editors with distinct features regarding the editing window and target scope. Here we developed a toolkit of plant base editors containing AID10, an engineered human AID cytosine deaminase. When fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the conventional Cas9 nickase (nSpCas9), AID10 exhibited a broad or narrow activity window at the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-distal and -proximal protospacer, respectively, while AID10 fused to both termini conferred an additive activity window. We further replaced nSpCas9 with orthogonal or PAM-relaxed Cas9 variants to widen target scopes. Moreover, we devised dual base editors with AID10 located adjacently or distally to the adenine deaminase ABE8e, leading to juxtaposed or spaced cytosine and adenine co-editing at the same target sequence in plant cells. Furthermore, we expanded the application of this toolkit in plants for tunable knockdown of protein-coding genes via creating upstream open reading frame and for loss-of-function analysis of non-coding genes, such as microRNA sponges. Collectively, this toolkit increases the functional diversity and versatility of base editors in basic and applied plant research.",False,True,,0.6839292,nspcas9,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

With the development of molecular diagnosis and point-of-care testing (POCT) technology, developing simple, fast, sensitive, efficient, and low-cost miRNA sensors is of great significance for clinical applications and emergency rapid diagnosis. At present, entropy-driven toehold mediated chain displacement reaction, as a promising enzyme free isothermal amplification technique, is an important tool for ultra-sensitive biosensing applications.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we used gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as carriers and quenchers, modified them using self-assembled triple chain composite substrates AuNPs@A@B1/B2, and used dual reporter molecules for cascade cyclic amplification to amplify fluorescence signals, which proposed a fluorescent biosensor based on this reaction and build an intelligent fluorescence sensing platform for rapid detection of miRNA. We designed a highly specific self-programmable sensor using the acute ischemic stroke (AIS) biomarker miRNA-125a-5p as a sample, and achieved sensitive detection of miRNA in the range of 0.01 μM∼10 μ M under optimal conditions. It broke through the traditional detection limitations of weak signals and liberated the fluorescence detection environment.<h4>Significance</h4>In summary, this creative miRNA biosensor combined with POCT has demonstrated extraordinary detection potential, broad application prospects in the early diagnosis and prognosis monitoring of AIS, provides a novel miRNA universal detection strategy for the fields of biological and life sciences.",False,True,,0.6373174,mirna-125a-5p,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

The development of the parallel EELS instrument and fast, sensitive detectors have greatly improved the acquisition speed of EELS spectra. However, the traditional way of core-loss edge recognition is experience based and human labor dependent, which limits the processing speed. So far, the low signal-noise ratio and the low jump ratio of the core-loss edges on the raw EELS spectra have been challenging for the automation of edge recognition. In this work, a convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed to automate the detection and elemental identification of core-loss edges from raw spectra. An EELS spectral database is synthesized by using our forward model to assist in the training and validation of the neural network. To make the synthesized spectra resemble the real spectra, we collected a large library of experimentally acquired EELS core edges. In synthesize the training library, the edges are modeled by fitting the multi-Gaussian model to the real edges from experiments, and the noise and instrumental imperfectness are simulated and added. The well-trained CNN-BiLSTM network is tested against both the simulated spectra and real spectra collected from experiments. The high accuracy of the network, 94.9%, proves that, without complicated preprocessing of the raw spectra, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM network achieves the automation of core-loss edge recognition for EELS spectra with high accuracy.",False,True,,0.7073412,cnn-bilstm,eels | cnn,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36367858,Capsules with bacteria and fungi in distinct compartments: A platform for studying microbes from different kingdoms and their cross-communication.,"Recently, we have created 'artificial cells' with an architecture mimicking that of typical eukaryotic cells. Our design uses common biopolymers like alginate and chitosan to create multi-compartment capsules (MCCs) via oil-free microfluidics. MCCs (~ 500 μm in diameter) can be engineered with multiple inner compartments, each with a distinct payload. This mimics the distinct organelles in eukaryotic cells, each of which has unique properties. In this study, we encapsulate microbial cells from two distinct kingdoms - Pseudomonas aeruginosa (bacteria) and Candida albicans (fungi) - in the inner compartments of MCCs. The two microbes are commonly found in biofilms at sites of infection in humans. We first demonstrate that the MCC can serve as a simple platform to observe the comparative growth of the cells in real time. Unlike typical co-culture in solution or on agar plates, the cells can grow in their own compartments without direct physical contact. Moreover, the hydrogel matrix in the compartments mimics the three-dimensional (3-D) environment that cells naturally encounter during their growth. Small molecules added to the solution are shown to permeate through the capsule walls and affect cell growth: for example, cationic surfactants inhibit the fungi but not the bacteria. Conversely, low pH and kanamycin inhibit the bacteria but not the fungi. Also, when the bacteria are present in adjacent compartments, the fungal cells mostly stay in a yeast morphology, meaning as spheroidal cells. In contrast, in the absence of the bacteria, the fungi transition into hyphae, i.e., long multicellular filaments. The inhibition of this morphological switch in fungal cells is shown to be induced by signaling molecules (specifically, the quorum sensing autoinducer-1 or AI-1) secreted by the bacteria. Thus, the MCC platform can also be used to detect cross-kingdom signaling between the compartmentalized microbes.",False,True,,0.67637336,,mcc,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Capsules with bacteria and fungi in distinct compartments,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

These diverse conceptual constructs indicate multi-dimensional rather than two-dimensional relationships. This paper provides the first tensor-based treatment of hetero-functional graph theory. In particular, it addresses the ""system concept"" and the hetero-functional adjacency matrix from the perspective of tensors and introduces the hetero-functional incidence tensor as a new data structure.

Inspired by recent advances in molecular barcoding and evolution, we developed BarcodeBabel, a generalized method for the design of libraries of peptide barcodes suitable for high-throughput mass spectrometry proteomics. Combined with PeptideBabel, a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for the design of peptides with evolvable physicochemical properties and sequence complexity, we developed a barcoded library of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) with distinct physicochemical features. Using quantitative targeted mass spectrometry, we identified CPPS with improved nuclear and cytoplasmic delivery exceeding hundreds of millions of molecules per human cell while maintaining minimal membrane disruption and negligible toxicity in vitro. These studies provide a proof of concept for peptide barcoding as a homogeneous high-throughput method for macromolecular screening and delivery.

36499090,A Novel Huntington's Disease Assessment Platform to Support Future Drug Discovery and Development.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder without efficient therapeutic options. The inefficient translation from preclinical and clinical research into clinical use is mainly attributed to the lack of (i) understanding of disease initiation, progression, and involved molecular mechanisms; (ii) knowledge of the possible HD target space and general data awareness; (iii) detailed characterizations of available disease models; (iv) better suitable models; and (v) reliable and sensitive biomarkers. To generate robust HD-like symptoms in a mouse model, the neomycin resistance cassette was excised from zQ175 mice, generating a new line: zQ175<sup>Δneo</sup>. We entirely describe the dynamics of behavioral, neuropathological, and immunohistological changes from 15-57 weeks of age. Specifically, zQ175<sup>Δneo</sup> mice showed early astrogliosis from 15 weeks; growth retardation, body weight loss, and anxiety-like behaviors from 29 weeks; motor deficits and reduced muscular strength from 36 weeks; and finally slight microgliosis at 57 weeks of age. Additionally, we collected the entire bioactivity network of small-molecule HD modulators in a multitarget dataset (HD_MDS). Hereby, we uncovered 358 unique compounds addressing over 80 different pharmacological targets and pathways.

37531298,A Workflow to Produce a Low-Cost In Vitro Platform for the Electric-Field Pacing of Cellularised 3D Porous Scaffolds.,"Endogenous electrically mediated signaling is a key feature of most native tissues, the most notable examples being the nervous and the cardiac systems. Biomedical engineering often aims to harness and drive such activity in vitro, in bioreactors to study cell disease and differentiation, and often in three-dimensional (3D) formats with the help of biomaterials, with most of these approaches adopting scaffold-free self-assembling strategies to create 3D tissues. In essence, this is the casting of gels which self-assemble in response to factors such as temperature or pH and have capacity to harbor cells during this process without imparting toxicity. However, the use of materials that do not self-assemble but can support 3D encapsulation of cells (such as porous scaffolds) warrants consideration given the larger repertoire this would provide in terms of material physicochemical properties and microstructure. In this method and protocol paper, we detail and provide design codes and assembly instructions to cheaply create an electrical pacing bioreactor and a Rig for Stimulation of Sponge-like Scaffolds (R3S). This setup has also been engineered to simultaneously perform live optical imaging of the in vitro models. To showcase a pilot exploration of material physiochemistry (in this aspect material conductivity) and microstructure (isotropy versus anisotropy), we adopt isotropic and anisotropic porous scaffolds composed of collagen or poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) for their contrasting conductivity properties yet similar in porosity and mechanical integrity. Electric field pacing of mouse C3H10 cells on anisotropic porous scaffolds placed in R3S led to increased metabolic activity and enhanced cell alignment. Furthermore, after 7 days electrical pacing drove C3H10 alignment regardless of material conductivity or anisotropy. This platform and its design, which we have shared, have wide suitability for the study of electrical pacing of cellularized scaffolds in 3D in vitro cultures.",False,True,,0.67017543,dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate,pedot,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37432995,General features of transmembrane beta barrels from a large database.,"Large datasets contribute new insights to subjects formerly investigated by exemplars. We used coevolution data to create a large, high-quality database of transmembrane β-barrels (TMBB). By applying simple feature detection on generated evolutionary contact maps, our method (IsItABarrel) achieves 95.88% balanced accuracy when discriminating among protein classes. Moreover, comparison with IsItABarrel revealed a high rate of false positives in previous TMBB algorithms. In addition to being more accurate than previous datasets, our database (available online) contains 1,938,936 bacterial TMBB proteins from 38 phyla, respectively, 17 and 2.2 times larger than the previous sets TMBB-DB and OMPdb. We anticipate that due to its quality and size, the database will serve as a useful resource where high-quality TMBB sequence data are required. We found that TMBBs can be divided into 11 types, three of which have not been previously reported. We find tremendous variance in proteome percentage among TMBB-containing organisms with some using 6.79% of their proteome for TMBBs and others using as little as 0.27% of their proteome. The distribution of the lengths of the TMBBs is suggestive of previously hypothesized duplication events. In addition, we find that the C-terminal β-signal varies among different classes of bacteria though its consensus sequence is LGLGYRF. However, this β-signal is only characteristic of prototypical TMBBs. The ten non-prototypical barrel types have other C-terminal motifs, and it remains to be determined if these alternative motifs facilitate TMBB insertion or perform any other signaling function.",False,True,,0.6353754,,tmbb-db | ompdb | tmbbs | lglgyrf,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
38153911,Ligation-Based High-Performance Mimetic Enzyme Sensing Platform for Nucleic Acid Detection.,"G-quadruplex (G4)/hemin DNAzyme is a promising candidate to substitute horseradish peroxidase in biosensing systems, especially for the detection of nucleic acids. However, the relatively suboptimal catalytic capacity limits its potential applications. This makes it imperative to develop an ideal signal for the construction of highly sensitive biosensing platforms. Herein, we integrated a novel chimeric peptide-DNAzyme (CPDzyme) with the ligase chain reaction (LCR) for the cost-efficient and highly sensitive detection of nucleic acids. By employing microRNA (miRNA) and single-nucleotide polymorphism detection as the model, we designed a G4-forming sequence on the LCR probe with a terminally labeled amino group. Subsequently, asymmetric hemin with carboxylic arms allowed assembly with the LCR products and peptide to form CPDzyme, followed by the magnetic separation of the extraneous components and chemiluminescence detection. Compared with the conventional G4/hemin signaling-based method, the LCR-CPDzyme system demonstrated 3 orders of magnitude improved sensitivity, with accurate quantification of as low as 25 aM miRNA and differentiation of 0.1% of mutant DNA from the pool containing a large amount of wild-type DNA. The proposed LCR-CPDzyme strategy is a potentially powerful method for in vitro diagnostics and serves as a reference for the development of other ligation- or hybridization-based nucleic acid amplification assays.",False,True,,0.61066157,cpdzyme,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36433655,A building-block database of distributed polarizabilities and dipole moments to estimate optical properties of biomacromolecules in isolation or in an explicitly solvated medium.,"Since atomic or functional-group properties in the bulk are generally not available from experimental methods, computational approaches based on partitioning schemes have emerged as a rapid yet accurate pathway to estimate the materials behavior from chemically meaningful building blocks. Among several applications, a comprehensive and systematically built database of atomic or group polarizabilities and related opto-electronic quantities would be very useful not only to envisage linear or non-linear optical properties of biomacromolecules but also to improve the accuracy of classical force fields devoted to simulate biochemical processes. In this work, we propose the first entries of such database that contains distributed polarizabilities and dipole moments extracted from fragments of peptides. Twenty three prototypical conformers of the dipeptides alanine-alanine and glycine-glycine were used to extract functional groups such as CH<sub>2</sub> , CHCH<sub>3</sub> , NH<sub>2</sub> , COOH, CONH, thus allowing construction of a diversity of chemically relevant environments. To evaluate the accuracy of our database, reconstructed properties of larger peptides containing up to six residues of alanine and glycine were tested against density functional theory calculations at the M06-HF/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. The procedure is particularly accurate for the diagonal components of the polarizability tensor with errors up to 15%. In order to include solvent effects explicitly, the peptides were also surrounded by a box of water molecules whose distribution was optimized using the CHARMM force field.

39989012,A Novel Gene Synthesis Platform for Designing Functional Protein Polymers.,"Recombinant protein polymers with repeat sequences of specific amino acids can be regarded as sustainable functional materials that can be designed using genetic engineering. However, synthesizing genes encoding these proteins is significantly time-consuming and labor-intensive owing to the difficulty of using common gene synthesis tools, such as restriction enzymes and PCR primers. To overcome these obstacles, a novel method is proposed herein: seamless cloning of rolling-circle amplicons (SCRCA). This method involves one-pot preparation of repetitive-sequence genes with overlapping ends for cloning, facilitating the easy construction of the desired recombinants. SCRCA is used to synthesize 10 genes encoding hydrophilic resilin-like and hydrophobic elastin-like repeat units that induce liquid-liquid phase separation. SCRCA shows higher transformation efficiency and better workability than conventional methods, and the time and budget required for SCRCA are comparable to those required for non-repetitive-sequence gene synthesis. Additionally, SCRCA facilitates the construction of a repeat unit library at a low cost. The library shows considerably higher diversity than that of the current state-of-the-art method. By combining this library construction with the directed evolution concept, an elastin-like protein polymer with the desired functions can be rapidly developed.

Given the advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the identification of causal variants associated with a target phenotype has become feasible. For these reasons, here, by combining sequence capture and target-enrichment methods with high-throughput NGS re-sequencing, we were able to scan at exome-wide level 46 randomly selected bread wheat individuals from a recombinant inbred line population and to identify and classify a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For technical validation of results, eight randomly selected SNPs were converted into Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers.

However, it is difficult to achieve label-free detection at the single-cell level in dynamic liquids because nanoprobe aggregation in biological fluids and the low combination of nanoprobes and cells reduce the sensitivity of SERS detection. Herein, a dynamic liquid integrated single-cell SERS (DLISC-SERS) platform is developed for the label-free detection of single cancer cells. DLISC-SERS consists of three components, including a twisted mixing microfluidic chip to achieve an efficient combination of nanoprobes and cells, a commercial coaxial needle to accomplish 3D dynamic liquid focusing by annular sheath flow, and a quartz capillary to offer a SERS detection area with low noise. The mixing intensity of the twisted mixing microfluidic chip is almost 3.67-fold higher than that of straight mixing. The multifunctionally modified nanoprobe, Ag NSs@PEG@3COOH, can be stably dispersed in biological fluids for at least 30 min. The segment weighting similarity-based KNN model can classify single-cell spectra with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy up to 100, 99.4, and 99.5%, respectively. The accuracy of the model for three-way classification is 95.2%.

36155273,Knowledgebase of potential multifaceted solutions to antimicrobial resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a top threat to global health, challenges preventive and treatment strategies of infections. AMR strains of microbial pathogens arise through multiple mechanisms. The underlying ""antibiotic resistance genes"" (ARGs) spread through various species by lateral gene transfer thereby causing global dissemination. Human methods also augment this process through inappropriate use, non-compliance to treatment schedule, and environmental waste. Worldwide significant efforts are being invested to discover novel therapeutic solutions for tackling resistant pathogens. Diverse therapeutic strategies have evolved over recent years. In this work we have developed a comprehensive knowledgebase by collecting alternative antimicrobial therapeutic strategies from literature data. Therapeutic strategies against bacteria, virus, fungus and parasites were extracted from PubMed literature using text mining. We have used a subjective (sentimental) approach for data mining new strategies, resulting in broad coverage of novel entities and subsequently add objective data like entity name (including IUPAC), potency, and safety information. The extracted data was organized in a freely accessible web platform, KOMBAT. The KOMBAT comprises 1104 Chemical compounds, 220 of newly identified antimicrobial peptides, 42 bacteriophages, 242 phytochemicals, 106 nanocomposites, and 94 novel entities for phototherapy.

The technique is increasingly applied by clinical microbiological laboratories that use commercially available complete solutions, including spectra databases covering clinically relevant bacteria. Such databases are validated for clinical, or research applications, but are often less comprehensive concerning highly pathogenic bacteria (HPB). To improve MALDI-ToF MS diagnostics of HPB we initiated a program to develop protocols for reliable and MALDI-compatible microbial inactivation and to acquire mass spectra thereof many years ago. As a result of this project, databases covering HPB, closely related bacteria, and bacteria of clinical relevance have been made publicly available on platforms such as ZENODO. This publication in detail describes the most recent version of this database. The dataset contains a total of 11,055 spectra from altogether 1,601 microbial strains and 264 species and is primarily intended to improve the diagnosis of HPB.

35401651,Addressing Privacy Concerns in Sharing Viral Sequences and Minimum Contextual Data in a Public Repository During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"COVID-19 was declared to be a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Timely sharing of viral genomic sequencing data accompanied by a minimal set of contextual data is essential for informing regional, national, and international public health responses. Such contextual data is also necessary for developing, and improving clinical therapies and vaccines, and enhancing the scientific community's understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN) was launched in April 2020 to coordinate and upscale existing genomics-based COVID-19 research and surveillance efforts. CanCOGeN is performing large-scale sequencing of both the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 virus samples (VirusSeq) and affected Canadians (HostSeq). This paper addresses the privacy concerns associated with sharing the viral sequence data with a pre-defined set of contextual data describing the sample source and case attribute of the sequence data in the Canadian context. Currently, the viral genome sequences are shared by provincial public health laboratories and their healthcare and academic partners, with the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory and with publicly accessible databases. However, data sharing delays and the provision of incomplete contextual data often occur because publicly releasing such data triggers privacy and data governance concerns. The CanCOGeN Ethics and Governance Expert Working Group thus has investigated several privacy issues cited by CanCOGeN data providers/stewards. This paper addresses these privacy concerns and offers insights primarily in the Canadian context, although similar privacy considerations also exist in other jurisdictions. We maintain that sharing viral sequencing data and its limited associated contextual data in the public domain generally does not pose insurmountable privacy challenges. However, privacy risks associated with reidentification should be actively monitored due to advancements in reidentification methods and the evolving pandemic landscape. We also argue that during a global health emergency such as COVID-19, privacy should not be used as a blanket measure to prevent such genomic data sharing due to the significant benefits it provides towards public health responses and ongoing research activities.",False,True,,0.6108814,canadian covid-19 genomics network | cancogen | cancogen ethics and governance expert working group thus has investigated several privacy issues cited by,,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39038936,A large-scale assessment of sequence database search tools for homology-based protein function prediction.,"Sequence database searches followed by homology-based function transfer form one of the oldest and most popular approaches for predicting protein functions, such as Gene Ontology (GO) terms. These searches are also a critical component in most state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning-based protein function predictors. Although sequence search tools are the basis of homology-based protein function prediction, previous studies have scarcely explored how to select the optimal sequence search tools and configure their parameters to achieve the best function prediction. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of using different options from among popular search tools, as well as the impacts of search parameters, on protein function prediction. When predicting GO terms on a large benchmark dataset, we found that BLASTp and MMseqs2 consistently exceed the performance of other tools, including DIAMOND-one of the most popular tools for function prediction-under default search parameters. However, with the correct parameter settings, DIAMOND can perform comparably to BLASTp and MMseqs2 in function prediction. Additionally, we developed a new scoring function to derive GO prediction from homologous hits that consistently outperform previously proposed scoring functions. These findings enable the improvement of almost all protein function prediction algorithms with a few easily implementable changes in their sequence homolog-based component. This study emphasizes the critical role of search parameter settings in homology-based function transfer and should have an important contribution to the development of future protein function prediction algorithms.",False,True,,0.70144045,,diamond,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Their role and function are tightly related to the local structure of the metal-binding site. In this regard, the MetalPDB database is an invaluable tool since it stores the 3D structure of metal-binding sites and of their corresponding apo forms. In this work, we exploited MetalPDB to compute extensive statistics over >3000 clusters of mononuclear sites about the rearrangements occurring upon change in metalation state. For each cluster, we matched the holo and apo sites so that it was possible to average the distances between all possible pairs of Cα and donor atoms and thus quantitatively assess structural variations by computing the Δ values (mean apo distance - mean holo distance). For most of the structures the backbone is rigid with little to no rearrangement, while donor atoms experience significant changes of their relative position when the metal is removed. Sodium and potassium sites are an exception to this general observation. This is most likely caused by their preference for coordination by the main-chain oxygen atoms, making the rearrangement of donor atoms superimposable to that of the backbone. Magnesium and calcium show a different behavior, despite their chemical similarity: calcium sites undergo a larger reorganization upon metalation although both metals have similar percentage of backbone oxygen as donor atoms. We ascribe this observation to the structural and energetic factors regulating the selectivity for calcium over magnesium.",False,True,,0.69604236,metalpdb,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36761561,A spatially-explicit database of tree-related microhabitats in Europe and beyond.,"<h4>Background</h4>Tree to tree interactions are important structuring mechanisms for forest community dynamics. Forest management takes advantage of competition effects on tree growth by removing or retaining trees to achieve management goals. Both competition and silviculture have, thus, a strong effect on density and distribution of tree related microhabitats which are key features for forest taxa at the stand scale. In particular, spatially-explicit data to understand patterns and mechanisms of tree-related microhabitats formation in forest stands are rare. To train and eventually improve decision-making capacities related to the integration of biodiversity aspects into forest management plot of one hectare, so called marteloscopes were established in the frame of the 'European Integrate Network'. In each plot, a set of data is collected at the individual tree level and stored in a database, the 'I+ repository'. The 'I+ repository' is a centralised online database which serves for maintaining the data of all marteloscope plots. A subset of this repository was made publicly available via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, based on a data-sharing policy. Data included are tree location in plot, tree species, forest mensuration data (diameter at breast height [cm], tree height [m]), tree status (living or standing dead) and tree-related microhabitats. Further, a visual assessment of timber quality classes is performed in order to provide an estimate of the economic value (market price) for each tree. This information is not part of the GBIF dataset.<h4>New information</h4>Currently 42,078 individual tree observations from 111 plots are made available via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). As the network of plots continues to expand, so does the database of tree-related microhabitats. Therefore, the database will undergo a regular update. The current version has a temporal coverage from March 2014 to December 2020. The innovation of this unique dataset is that it is based on a commonly agreed catalogue of tree microhabitats as a field reference list when assessing assessment protocol. The reference list is available in 17 languages and, thus, helps to guarantee compatibility of tree-related microhabitat assessments across countries and plots.",False,True,,0.6845238,european integrate network | global biodiversity information facility,i+ | gbif,6.0,conflict,gbif | global biodiversity information facility,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
38072328,Exploring RAD18-dependent replication of damaged DNA and discontinuities: A collection of advanced tools.,"DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways mitigate the effects of DNA damage during replication by rescuing the replication fork stalled at a DNA lesion or other barriers and also repair discontinuities left in the newly replicated DNA. From yeast to mammalian cells, RAD18-regulated translesion synthesis (TLS) and template switching (TS) represent the dominant pathways of DDT. Monoubiquitylation of the polymerase sliding clamp PCNA by HRAD6A-B/RAD18, an E2/E3 protein pair, enables the recruitment of specialized TLS polymerases that can insert nucleotides opposite damaged template bases. Alternatively, the subsequent polyubiquitylation of monoubiquitin-PCNA by Ubc13-Mms2 (E2) and HLTF or SHPRH (E3) can lead to the switching of the synthesis from the damaged template to the undamaged newly synthesized sister strand to facilitate synthesis past the lesion. When immediate TLS or TS cannot occur, gaps may remain in the newly synthesized strand, partly due to the repriming activity of the PRIMPOL primase, which can be filled during the later phases of the cell cycle. The first part of this review will summarize the current knowledge about RAD18-dependent DDT pathways, while the second part will offer a molecular toolkit for the identification and characterization of the cellular functions of a DDT protein. In particular, we will focus on advanced techniques that can reveal single-stranded and double-stranded DNA gaps and their repair at the single-cell level as well as monitor the progression of single replication forks, such as the specific versions of the DNA fiber and comet assays.

The emergence of zoonotic viruses such as Zika, Ebola, and SARS-CoV-2 have accelerated AVP research, driven by advancements in data availability and artificial intelligence (AI). This review focuses on the development of AVP databases, their physicochemical properties, and predictive tools utilizing machine learning for AVP discovery. Machine learning plays a pivotal role in advancing and developing antiviral peptides and peptidomimetics, particularly through the development of specialized databases such as DRAVP, AVPdb, and DBAASP. These resources facilitate AVP characterization but face limitations, including small datasets, incomplete annotations, and inadequate integration with multi-omics data.The antiviral efficacy of AVPs is closely linked to their physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and amphipathic α-helical structures, which enable viral membrane disruption and specific target interactions. Computational prediction tools employing machine learning and deep learning have significantly advanced AVP discovery. However, challenges like overfitting, limited experimental validation, and a lack of mechanistic insights hinder clinical translation.Future advancements should focus on improved validation frameworks, integration of in vivo data, and the development of interpretable models to elucidate AVP mechanisms.

36761695,The computational implementation of a platform of relative identity-by-descent scores algorithm for introgressive mapping.,"With the development of genotyping and sequencing technology, researchers working in the area of conservation genetics are able to obtain the genotypes or even the sequences of a representative sample of individuals from the population. It is of great importance to examine the genomic variants and genes that are highly preferred or pruned during the process of adaptive introgression or long-term hybridization. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a platform with computational integration of a relative identity-by-descent (rIBD) scores algorithm for introgressive mapping. The rIBD algorithm is designed for mapping the fine-scaled genomic regions under adaptive introgression between the source breeds and the admixed breed. Our rIBD calculation platform provides compact functions including reading input information and uploading of files, rIBD calculation, and presentation of the rIBD scores. We analyzed the simulated data using the rIBD calculation platform and calculated the average IBD score of 0.061 with a standard deviation of 0.124.

36991084,Automated high-throughput image processing as part of the screening platform for personalized oncology.,"Cancer is a devastating disease and the second leading cause of death worldwide. However, the development of resistance to current therapies is making cancer treatment more difficult. Combining the multi-omics data of individual tumors with information on their in-vitro Drug Sensitivity and Resistance Test (DSRT) can help to determine the appropriate therapy for each patient. Miniaturized high-throughput technologies, such as the droplet microarray, enable personalized oncology. We are developing a platform that incorporates DSRT profiling workflows from minute amounts of cellular material and reagents. Experimental results often rely on image-based readout techniques, where images are often constructed in grid-like structures with heterogeneous image processing targets. However, manual image analysis is time-consuming, not reproducible, and impossible for high-throughput experiments due to the amount of data generated. Therefore, automated image processing solutions are an essential component of a screening platform for personalized oncology. We present our comprehensive concept that considers assisted image annotation, algorithms for image processing of grid-like high-throughput experiments, and enhanced learning processes. In addition, the concept includes the deployment of processing pipelines. Details of the computation and implementation are presented. In particular, we outline solutions for linking automated image processing for personalized oncology with high-performance computing.

Along with updating the package to match the changes to MetabolomicsWB's 'mwTab' file format specification and enhancing the package's functionality, the included validation facilities were used to detect and catalog file inconsistencies and errors across all publicly available datasets in MetabolomicsWB.<h4>Results</h4>The MetabolomicsWB File Status website was developed to provide continuous validation of MetabolomicsWB data files and a useful interface to all found inconsistencies and errors. This list of detectable issues/errors include format parsing errors, format compliance issues, access problems via MetabolomicsWB's REST interface, and other small inconsistencies that can hinder reusability. The website uses the mwtab Python package to pull down and validate each available analysis file and then generates an html report. The website is updated on a weekly basis. Moreover, the Python website design utilizes GitHub and GitHub.io, providing an easy to replicate template for implementing other metadata, virtual, and meta- repositories.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The MetabolomicsWB File Status website provides a metadata repository of validation metadata to promote the FAIR use of existing metabolomics datasets from the MetabolomicsWB data repository.",False,True,,0.7172327,metabolomicswb | metabolomicswb.<h4 | github.io,,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,metabolomics workbench file status website,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36925620,Small training dataset convolutional neural networks for application-specific super-resolution microscopy.,"<h4>Significance</h4>Machine learning (ML) models based on deep convolutional neural networks have been used to significantly increase microscopy resolution, speed [signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)], and data interpretation. The bottleneck in developing effective ML systems is often the need to acquire large datasets to train the neural network. We demonstrate how adding a ""dense encoder-decoder"" (DenseED) block can be used to effectively train a neural network that produces super-resolution (SR) images from conventional microscopy diffraction-limited (DL) images trained using a small dataset [15 fields of view (FOVs)].<h4>Aim</h4>The ML helps to retrieve SR information from a DL image when trained with a massive training dataset. The aim of this work is to demonstrate a neural network that estimates SR images from DL images using modifications that enable training with a small dataset.<h4>Approach</h4>We employ ""DenseED"" blocks in existing SR ML network architectures. DenseED blocks use a dense layer that concatenates features from the previous convolutional layer to the next convolutional layer. DenseED blocks in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) estimate the SR images when trained with a small training dataset (15 FOVs) of human cells from the Widefield2SIM dataset and in fluorescent-labeled fixed bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells samples.<h4>Results</h4>Conventional ML models without DenseED blocks trained on small datasets fail to accurately estimate SR images while models including the DenseED blocks can. The average peak SNR (PSNR) and resolution improvements achieved by networks containing DenseED blocks are ≈ 3.2    dB  and 2 ×  , respectively. We evaluated various configurations of target image generation methods (e.g., experimentally captured a target and computationally generated target) that are used to train FCNs with and without DenseED blocks and showed that including DenseED blocks in simple FCNs outperforms compared to simple FCNs without DenseED blocks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DenseED blocks in neural networks show accurate extraction of SR images even if the ML model is trained with a small training dataset of 15 FOVs. This approach shows that microscopy applications can use DenseED blocks to train on smaller datasets that are application-specific imaging platforms and there is promise for applying this to other imaging modalities, such as MRI/x-ray, etc.",False,True,,0.6757817,denseed,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

It possesses various secondary metabolites, such as L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alkaloids and poly saccharides, which make it a high nutritional and medicinal value. Here we characterized the chromosome-level genome sequence of R. roxburghii, comprising seven pseudo-chromosomes with a total size of 531 Mb and a heterozygosity of 0.25%. We also annotated 45,226 coding gene loci after masking repeat elements. Orthologs for 90.1% of the Complete Single-Copy BUSCOs were found in the R. roxburghii annotation. By aligning with protein sequences from public platform, we annotated 85.89% genes from R. roxburghii. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that R. roxburghii diverged from Rosa chinensis approximately 5.58 to 13.17 million years ago, and no whole-genome duplication event occurred after the divergence from eudicots. To fully utilize this genomic resource, we constructed a genomic database RroFGD with various analysis tools. Otherwise, 69 enzyme genes involved in L-ascorbate biosynthesis were identified and a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of vitamin C, GDH (L-Gal-1-dehydrogenase), is used as an example to introduce the functions of the database.

However, the precision cutting capabilities of existing laser microdissection systems are hindered by limitations in overall mechanical movement accuracy, resulting in suboptimal cutting quality. Additionally, the use of current laser microdissection systems for target acquisition may lead to tissue burns and reduced acquisition rates due to inherent flaws in the capture methods. To address these challenges and achieve precise and efficient separation and capture of cellular tissues, we integrated a digital micromirror device (DMD) into the existing system optics to modulate spatial light. This allows the system to not only implement the traditional point scanning cutting method but also utilize the projection cutting method.We have successfully cut various patterns on commonly used laser microdissection materials such as PET films and mouse tissues. Under projection cutting mode, we were able to achieve precise cutting of special shapes with a diameter of 7.5 micrometers in a single pass, which improved cutting precision and efficiency. Furthermore, we employed a negative pressure adsorption method to efficiently collect target substances. This approach not only resulted in a single-pass capture rate exceeding 90% for targets of different sizes but also enabled simultaneous capture of multiple targets, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-target capture and enhancing target capture efficiency, and avoiding potential tissue damage from lasers.In summary, the integration of the digital micromirror device into laser microdissection systems significantly enhances cutting precision and efficiency, overcoming limitations of traditional systems.

To address these issues, a novel defect detection technique based on deep learning and photometric stereo vision was proposed, along with the creation of the Metal Surface Defect Dataset (MSDD). The proposed Stroboscopic Illuminant Image Acquisition (SIIA) method uses a specially arranged illuminant setup and a Taylor Series Channel Mixer (TSCM) to blend multi-angle illumination images into pseudo-color images. This approach enables end-to-end defect detection using universal object detectors. The method involves mapping color space transformations to spatial domain transformations and utilizing hue randomization for data augmentation. Four object detection methods (FCOS, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and RT-DETR) were validated on the MSDD, achieving an mAP of 86.1%, surpassing traditional methods. The MSDD includes 138,585 single-channel images and 9,239 mixed images, covering eight defect types.

The abundance of digital sequence information (DSI) has provided research opportunities, improved our understanding of the genome, and led to the discovery of new solutions in industry and medicine. It has also posed certain challenges, i.e., how to store and handle such amounts of data. This, coupled with the need for convenience, international cooperation, and the possibility of independent validation, has led to the establishment of numerous databases.

Polymers that can complex with proteins to form nano-assemblies represent one of the most important categories of materials, because of the ease of nano-fabrication, high protein loading efficiency, no need for purification, and maintenance of protein bioactivity. Stable protein encapsulation and efficient intracellular liberation are two critical yet opposite processes toward cytosolic delivery, and polymers that can resolve these two conflicting challenges are still lacking. Herein, hyperbranched poly(β-amino ester) (HPAE) with backbone-embedded phenylboronic acid (PBA) is developed to synchronize these two processes, wherein PBA enhanced protein encapsulation via nitrogen-boronate (N-B) coordination while triggered polymer degradation and protein release upon oxidation by H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in cancer cells.

38679191,Improving protein-protein interaction prediction using protein language model and protein network features.,"Interactions between proteins are ubiquitous in a wide variety of biological processes. Accurately identifying the protein-protein interaction (PPI) is of significant importance for understanding the mechanisms of protein functions and facilitating drug discovery. Although the wet-lab technological methods are the best way to identify PPI, their major constraints are their time-consuming nature, high cost, and labor-intensiveness. Hence, lots of efforts have been made towards developing computational methods to improve the performance of PPI prediction. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid computational method (called KSGPPI) that aims at improving the prediction performance of PPI via extracting the discriminative information from protein sequences and interaction networks. The KSGPPI model comprises two feature extraction modules. In the first feature extraction module, a large protein language model, ESM-2, is employed to exploit the global complex patterns concealed within protein sequences. Subsequently, feature representations are further extracted through CKSAAP, and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to capture local information. In the second feature extraction module, the query protein acquires its similar protein from the STRING database via the sequence alignment tool NW-align and then captures the graph embedding feature for the query protein in the protein interaction network of the similar protein using the algorithm of Node2vec. Finally, the features of these two feature extraction modules are efficiently fused; the fused features are then fed into the multilayer perceptron to predict PPI. The results of five-fold cross-validation on the used benchmarked datasets demonstrate that KSGPPI achieves an average prediction accuracy of 88.96 %. Additionally, the average Matthews correlation coefficient value (0.781) of KSGPPI is significantly higher than that of those state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods.

To examine its impact on DNA-protein interactions at the single-molecule level, we developed a highly efficient and reliable protocol to modify plasmid DNA at specific sites, allowing us to label plasmids with fluorophores and biotin. We then induced physiological levels of negative or positive supercoiling in these plasmids using gyrase or reverse gyrase, respectively. By comparing supercoiled DNA with relaxed circular DNA, we assessed the effects of supercoiling on CRISPR-Cas9 and the mismatch repair protein MutS. We found that negative DNA supercoiling exacerbates off-target effects in DNA unwinding by Cas9. For MutS, we observed that both negative and positive DNA supercoiling enhance the binding interaction between MutS and a mismatched base pair but do not affect the rate of ATP-induced sliding clamp formation. These findings not only underscore the versatility of our protocol but also open new avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of protein-DNA interactions under the influence of supercoiling.",False,True,,0.61109453,,muts,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Here, we report the assembly of a telomere-to-telomere gap-free genome of the elite watermelon inbred line G42 by incorporating high-coverage and accurate long-read sequencing data with multiple assembly strategies. All 11 chromosomes have been assembled into single-contig pseudomolecules without gaps, representing the highest completeness and assembly quality to date. The G42 reference genome is 369 321 829 bp in length and contains 24 205 predicted protein-coding genes, with all 22 telomeres and 11 centromeres characterized. Furthermore, we established a pollen-EMS mutagenesis protocol and obtained over 200 000 M1 seeds from G42 .

Accurate and efficient SNP determination has been proved pivotal in pharmacogenomics and diagnostics. Herein, a universal and high-fidelity genotyping platform is established based on the dual toeholds regulated Cas12a sensing methodology. Different from the conventional single stranded or double stranded activation mode, the dual toeholds regulated mode overcomes protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) limitation via cascade toehold mediated strand displacement reaction, which is highly universal and ultra-specific. To enhance the sensitivity for biological samples analysis, a modified isothermal recombinant polymerase amplification (RPA) strategy is developed via utilizing deoxythymidine substituted primer and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) treatment, designated as RPA-UDG. The dsDNA products containing single stranded toehold domain generated in the RPA-UDG allow further incorporation with dual toeholds regulated Cas12a platform for high-fidelity human sample genotyping. We discriminate all the single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ApoE gene at rs429358 and rs7412 loci with human buccal swab samples with 100% accuracy.

40023203,Expanding the cryoprotectant toolbox in biomedicine by multifunctional antifreeze peptides.,"The global cryopreservation market size rises exponentially due to increased demand for cell therapy-based products, assisted reproductive technology, and organ transplantation. Cryoprotectants (CPAs) are required to reduce ice-related damage, osmotic cell injury, and protein denaturation. Antioxidants are needed to hamper membrane lipid peroxidation under freezing stress, and antibiotics are added to the cryo-solutions to prevent contamination. The vitrification process for sized organs requires a high concentration of CPA, which is hardly achievable using conventional penetrating toxic CPAs like DMSO. Antifreeze peptides (AFpeps) are biocompatible CPAs leveraging inspiration from nature, such as freeze-tolerant and freeze-avoidant organisms, to circumvent logistic limitations in cryogenic conditions. This study aims to introduce the advances of AFpeps with cell-penetrating, antioxidant, and antimicrobial characteristics. We herein revisit the placement of AFpeps in the biobanking of cancer cells, immune cells, stem cells, blood cells, germ cells (sperms and oocytes), and probiotics. Implementing low-immunogenic AFpeps for allograft cryopreservation minimizes HLA mismatching risk after organ transplantation. Applying AFpeps to formulate bioinks with optimal rheology in extrusion-based 3D cryobiopriners expedites the bench-to-beside transition of bioprinted scaffolds. This study advocates that the fine-tuned synthetic or insect-derived AFpeps, forming round blunt-shape crystals, are biomedically broad-spectrum, and cell-permeable AFpeps from marine and plant sources, which result in sharp ice crystals, are appropriate for cryosurgery. Perspectives of the available room for developing peptide mimetics in favor of higher activity and stability and peptide-functionalized nanoparticles for enhanced delivery are delineated.

These proteins adopt either α-helical or β-barrel structures in the lipid bilayer of a cell/organelle membrane. Mutations in membrane proteins alter their structure and function, and may lead to diseases. Data on disease-causing and neutral mutations in membrane proteins are available in MutHTP and TMSNP databases, which provide additional features based on sequence, structure, topology, and diseases. These databases have been effectively utilized for analysing sequence and structure-based features in disease-causing and neutral mutations in membrane proteins, exploring disease-causing mechanisms, elucidating the relationship between sequence/structural parameters and diseases, and developing computational tools. Further, machine learning-based tools have been developed for identifying disease-causing mutations using diverse features, such as evolutionary information, physicochemical properties, atomic contacts, contact potentials, and the contribution of different energetic terms. These membrane protein-specific tools are helpful in characterizing the effect of new variants in the whole human membrane proteome. In this review, we provide a discussion of the available databases for disease-causing mutations in membrane proteins, followed by a statistical analysis of membrane protein mutations using sequence and structural features.

36156625,[A novel method for efficient screening and annotation of important pathway-associated metabolites based on the modified metabolome and probe molecules].,"Plants produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites in the process of evolution. Secondary metabolites have highly diverse structures due to the modification of the basic skeletons of metabolites. They are required for interaction with the environment and are produced in response to abiotic/biotic stress. Characterization of secondary metabolic pathways is significant to plant molecular breeding and natural product biosynthesis. The liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) is one of the major techniques for untargeted metabolomics study. The LC-HRMS/MS method could detect tens of thousands of metabolic features and provide abundant structural information. It has been widely used in the discovery and characterization of the secondary metabolome. However, due to the largely diverse structure and limited records in the mass spectral library, the annotation of the secondary metabolome is very difficult. To address the analytical challenges associated with the vast structural diversity and the large numbers of secondary metabolites, particularly those previously unknown structural metabolites, a novel method for the efficient characterization of pathway-associated metabolites was developed. Modification reactions and MS/MS spectral information were collected using the metabolic pathways database and mass spectral library. Screening and annotation of metabolites involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism in maize leaves were used as an example. First, a database of modified groups was established via pathway-associated modifications from open access metabolic pathway database and literature. Here, pathway databases included the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Plant Metabolic Pathways (PlantCyc). A total of 61 modification types were enrolled, including 10 generic and 51 pathway-specific modifications. Modified metabolomes were filtered from untargeted LC-HRMS/MS metabolomics data. Next, MS/MS spectra of the pathway-associated compounds (probe molecules) were collected in the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) MS/MS spectral library. The MS/MS of compounds assigned to chemical classes of phenylpropanoids were kept. An MS/MS spectral database of the probe molecules was constructed. It included 2677 spectra of 1542 phenylpropanoid compounds in the positive mode and 814 spectra of 661 phenylpropanoid compounds in the negative mode. Then, an MS/MS molecular network was generated by modified metabolome and probe molecules. The clusters comprising both probe molecules and modified metabolites were kept. To explore more previously unknown structural metabolites, the clusters with one more pathway-specific modified metabolite were retained even though they didn't contain any probe molecule. A total of 392 and 417 phenylpropanoid pathway-related metabolic metabolites were obtained in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. The pathway-associated metabolites were annotated based on the propagation of the molecular network. For the metabolites within the co-cluster, annotations were performed using the probe molecules as the initial seed. The modification group's substructure information was used for network propagation annotation. For the clusters containing only pathway-specific modified metabolites, the annotation is similar to the above process if identified nodes were present within the cluster. Otherwise, de novo annotation was manually executed based on substructure information. Finally, 129 unique metabolites were annotated after integration and removal of redundancy. Ten annotated metabolites were validated using commercially available or synthesized reference compounds. The other annotation results were validated using predicted chemical classes, <i>in silico</i> MS/MS, and predicted retention time. They are mainly involved in the downstream branch of phenylpropanoid pathways, including the flavonoid pathway (8 flavonoids, 19 flavonoid <i>O</i>-glycosides, 32 flavonoid <i>C</i>-glycosides), the hydroxycinnamic acid pathway (31 hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives), and the lignan pathway (22 neo-lignans/lignan/lignan glycosides). All the annotated structures were searched against the PubChem and SciFinder databases. Among them, 26 metabolites were previously unreported in both the databases. In this study, the pathway-associated metabolites could be quickly discovered and annotated by the integration of probe molecules and modified metabolome.

However, when sensor nodes generate data non-uniformly, the efficiency of data collection is constrained by rendezvous points and network topology.

Thus, this paper investigates non-uniform data generation in wireless sensor network and proposes an innovative approach: Optimal Clustering and Network Topology for Mobile Sink-Driven Data Collection, called OCNTMS. It focuses on determining optimal rendezvous points and their associated clusters. Through innovative methods such as weight-balanced clustering, cost function optimization, load-balanced link construction, and node forwarding selection, the OCNTMS can efficiently construct link sets within clusters and accurately plan the mobile sink's traversal of rendezvous points. Simulation results show that the OCNTMS reduces energy consumption by 18% and increases network lifetime by 40% compared with existing approaches under the constraint of non-uniform data generation.

Furthermore, innovations in bioinformatics, immunoinformatics, synthetic technologies, new materials, and transgenic animal models have put wings on the research of peptide-based vaccines for TB. Hence, this review seeks to give an overview of current tools that can be used to design a peptide-based vaccine, the research status of peptide-based vaccines for TB, protein-based bacterial vaccine delivery systems, and animal models for the peptide-based vaccines.

Classical or traditional security solutions are suitable for those applications that have sufficient computing resources. However, the rise of IoTs and its applications opens new directions for researchers to provide lightweight security solutions. Many IoT applications send critical image data over the Internet, which requires adequate protection. Traditional security solutions are not suitable due to the resource-constrained nature of the environments. An effective security solution is necessary for such environments that balance lightweight design with strong security measures. Current research efforts in this area lack the ability to provide both secure and lightweight properties simultaneously. Therefore, a robust and lightweight cryptosystem is needed to secure the sensitive information of digital images. This research addresses the existing gap by proposing a lightweight and robust cryptographic system that encrypts digital data in less processing time without compromising security. The proposed image encryption technique is evaluated using security and performance measures, such as cipher processing time, histogram analysis, entropy, correlation, mean square error and sensitivity analysis.

By focusing consideration of ecosystem services on final ecosystem goods and services (FEGS), the aspects of the environment directly enjoyed, used, or consumed by humans, these analyses can be more streamlined and effective. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed a set of tools to facilitate this consideration. The central feature of FEGS is that ecosystems are viewed through the diverse ways people directly benefit from them. The National Ecosystem Services Classification System (NESCS) Plus provides a framework for describing and identifying FEGS consistently. The standardization made available by NESCS Plus allows other tools and databases to interact using the NESCS Plus architecture and taxonomy, providing diverse insights for decision makers. Here, we examine the synergy of using the following four tools together: (1) the FEGS Scoping Tool; (2) the FEGS Metrics Report; (3) the EnviroAtlas; and (4) the EcoService Models Library. The FEGS Scoping Tool helps users determine what ecosystem services are relevant to a decision by harnessing FEGS understanding to enable communities to identify the relative importance of beneficiaries relevant to a decision and biophysical aspects of the environment of direct relevance to those beneficiaries. The FEGS Metrics Report can guide which metrics to monitor or model to represent those priority services. The EnviroAtlas, a powerful tool containing geospatial data and other resources related to ecosystem services, chemical and non-chemical stressors, and human health, and the EcoService Models Library, a database of ecosystem models, are two tools that support users in mapping and modeling endpoints relevant to priority services. While each of these tools is valuable on its own, together, they provide a powerful approach to easily incorporate and operationalize ecosystem services efforts into different parts of decision-making processes across different types of decisions. We illustrate how these integrated tools can be used together with a hypothetical example of a complex environmental management case study and the combined benefit of using the FEGS tools together.",False,True,,0.70560896,u.s. environmental protection agency | national ecosystem services classification system | enviroatlas,fegs,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,final ecosystem goods and services Voltron,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
36124251,Construction of a Basic Japanese Teaching Resource Base Based on a Deep Neural Network under a Big Data Environment.,"A challenge for education and teaching in universities is posed by ""Internet plus,"" which has made numerous educational resources at universities richer and more accessible. The development of a professional Japanese teaching resource base should be centered on the needs and characteristics of Japanese teaching in universities, as well as establish and enhance the mechanism for resource base construction. All forms of instructional resources should also continuously be updated and improved in order to realize the diversified, systematic, open, and long-term development of Japanese instructional resources. In light of the current state of the information technology industry's rapid expansion, this essay examines a few issues with the building of a Japanese teaching resource database. A fundamental Japanese teaching resource database built on DNN was created as a result. The CNN technology is used in this study to create the Arduino device identification application. Utilizing gadgets in the learning process, learners can obtain learning resources using the Arduino device identification program before engaging in learning activities. The experimental findings also demonstrate that the precision rate and recall rate of the Japanese teaching resource database system developed in this study may achieve about 93 and 94 percent, respectively.

36550341,Towards Effective Consensus Scoring in Structure-Based Virtual Screening.,"Virtual screening (VS) is a computational strategy that uses in silico automated protein docking inter alia to rank potential ligands, or by extension rank protein-ligand pairs, identifying potential drug candidates. Most docking methods use preferred sets of physicochemical descriptors (PCDs) to model the interactions between host and guest molecules. Thus, conventional VS is often data-specific, method-dependent and with demonstrably differing utility in identifying candidate drugs. This study proposes four universality classes of novel consensus scoring (CS) algorithms that combine docking scores, derived from ten docking programs (ADFR, DOCK, Gemdock, Ledock, PLANTS, PSOVina, QuickVina2, Smina, Autodock Vina and VinaXB), using decoys from the DUD-E repository ( http://dude.docking.org/ ) against 29 MRSA-oriented targets to create a general VS formulation that can identify active ligands for any suitable protein target. Our results demonstrate that CS provides improved ligand-protein docking fidelity when compared to individual docking platforms. This approach requires only a small number of docking combinations and can serve as a viable and parsimonious alternative to more computationally expensive docking approaches. Predictions from our CS algorithm are compared against independent machine learning evaluations using the same docking data, complementing the CS outcomes. Our method is a reliable approach for identifying protein targets and high-affinity ligands that can be tested as high-probability candidates for drug repositioning.",False,True,,0.67677534,,dud-e,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,http://dude.docking.org/,http://dude.docking.org/,True,"...VinaXB), using decoys from the DUD-E repository ( http://dude.docking.org/ ) against 29 MRSA-oriented targets to create a ge...",1
35239700,Hierarchical lifelong topic modeling using rules extracted from network communities.,"Topic models extract latent concepts from texts in the form of topics. Lifelong topic models extend topic models by learning topics continuously based on accumulated knowledge from the past which is updated continuously as new information becomes available. Hierarchical topic modeling extends topic modeling by extracting topics and organizing them into a hierarchical structure. In this study, we combine the two and introduce hierarchical lifelong topic models. Hierarchical lifelong topic models not only allow to examine the topics at different levels of granularity but also allows to continuously adjust the granularity of the topics as more information becomes available. A fundamental issue in hierarchical lifelong topic modeling is the extraction of rules that are used to preserve the hierarchical structural information among the rules and will continuously update based on new information. To address this issue, we introduce a network communities based rule mining approach for hierarchical lifelong topic models (NHLTM). The proposed approach extracts hierarchical structural information among the rules by representing textual documents as graphs and analyzing the underlying communities in the graph. Experimental results indicate improvement of the hierarchical topic structures in terms of topic coherence that increases from general to specific topics.",False,True,,0.6899777,,nhltm,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
38287124,Resource constrained neural network training.,"Modern applications of neural-network-based AI solutions tend to move from datacenter backends to low-power edge devices. Environmental, computational, and power constraints are inevitable consequences of such a shift. Limiting the bit count of neural network parameters proved to be a valid technique for speeding up and increasing efficiency of the inference process. Hence, it is understandable that a similar approach is gaining momentum in the field of neural network training. In the face of growing complexity of neural network architectures, reducing resources required for preparation of new models would not only improve cost efficiency but also enable a variety of new AI applications on modern personal devices. In this work, we present a deep refinement of neural network parameters limitation with the use of the asymmetric exponent method. In addition to the previous research, we study new techniques of floating-point variables limitation, representation, and rounding. Moreover, by leveraging exponent offset, we present floating-point precision adjustments without an increase in variables' bit count.

Thus, it is an excellent model organism for stem cell and regeneration research. Recently, many single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) databases of several model organisms, including other planarian species, have become publicly available; these are powerful and useful resources to search for gene expression in various tissues and cells. However, the only scRNA-seq dataset for D. japonica has been limited by the number of genes detected. Herein, we collected D. japonica cells, and conducted an scRNA-seq analysis. A novel, automatic, iterative cell clustering strategy produced a dataset of 3,404 cells, which could be classified into 63 cell types based on gene expression profiles. We introduced two examples for utilizing the scRNA-seq dataset in this study using D. japonica. First, the dataset provided results consistent with previous studies as well as novel functionally relevant insights, that is, the expression of DjMTA and DjP2X-A genes in neoblasts that give rise to differentiated cells. Second, we conducted an integrative analysis of the scRNA-seq dataset and time-course bulk RNA-seq of irradiated animals, demonstrating that the dataset can help interpret differentially expressed genes captured via bulk RNA-seq.

37386017,Combination of expert guidelines-based and machine learning-based approaches leads to superior accuracy of automated prediction of clinical effect of copy number variations.,"Clinical interpretation of copy number variants (CNVs) is a complex process that requires skilled clinical professionals. General recommendations have been recently released to guide the CNV interpretation based on predefined criteria to uniform the decision process. Several semiautomatic computational methods have been proposed to recommend appropriate choices, relieving clinicians of tedious searching in vast genomic databases. We have developed and evaluated such a tool called MarCNV and tested it on CNV records collected from the ClinVar database. Alternatively, the emerging machine learning-based tools, such as the recently published ISV (Interpretation of Structural Variants), showed promising ways of even fully automated predictions using broader characterization of affected genomic elements. Such tools utilize features additional to ACMG criteria, thus providing supporting evidence and the potential to improve CNV classification. Since both approaches contribute to evaluation of CNVs clinical impact, we propose a combined solution in the form of a decision support tool based on automated ACMG guidelines (MarCNV) supplemented by a machine learning-based pathogenicity prediction (ISV) for the classification of CNVs. We provide evidence that such a combined approach is able to reduce the number of uncertain classifications and reveal potentially incorrect classifications using automated guidelines.

Companies with good financial statements' key indicators have a more extensive customer base and can diversify their revenue streams, making them more resilient to economic downturns. Assembling and managing taxes is a critical underpinning to protecting a country's financial intensity and developing a country's tax-system. VAT is a primary source of financial gain in developing nations, which differs from economic income in developed countries, where economic income is primarily derived from tax income. In emerging economies, the existing practice requires firms to effectively and efficiently publish annual-reports and indicators on market-websites, as users rely heavily on timely-information and need it to make decisions. However, these practices fell short of expectations, requiring more research.

Precise characterization of these alkaloids is critical for quality control and pharmacological mechanism studies. However, conventional analytical approaches face significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of plant metabolite matrices and the ubiquitous presence of structural isomers, resulting in low identification accuracy and difficulties in detecting unknown compounds. First, a novel dimension-enhanced approach was developed by integrating solid-phase extraction (SPE) with liquid chromatography/ion mobility-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/IM-QTOF-MS) to acquire four-dimensional structural information (t<sub>R</sub>, MS, MS/MS, and CCS). Subsequently, collision cross-section (CCS) values were predicted using machine learning, and a multidimensional database for Fritillaria alkaloids, namely FasMID, was established. In the analysis of prediction tools, ALLCCS/CCSbase demonstrated superior accuracy and applicability. Leveraging FasMID, which contained information on 248 Fritillaria alkaloids (including m/z, CCS, and MS/MS data), an integrated multi-dimensional matching strategy was developed for annotating both known and unknown chemical structures. Automated identification of known Fritillaria alkaloids was achieved by processing data with UNIFI and searching against FasMID, elevating the identification accuracy from a baseline of 12 % with traditional methods to 70 % with optimized approach. Furthermore, feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) combined with multidimensional characteristics of Fritillaria alkaloids was utilized to annotate unknown components, facilitating the exploration of novel chemical structures.

In the current scenario, most of the services are migrated to the cloud, putting more load on the cloud data centres. As a result, the data center's size expands resulting in increased energy usage. To address this problem, a resource allocation optimisation method that is both efficient and effective is necessary. The optimal utilisation of cloud infrastructure and optimisation algorithms plays a vital role. The cloud resources rely on the allocation policy of the virtual machine on cloud resources. A virtual machine placement technique, based on the Harris Hawk Optimisation (HHO) model for the cloud data centre is presented in this paper. The proposed HHO model aims to find the best place for virtual machines on suitable hosts with the least load and power consumption. PlanetLab's real-time workload traces are used for performance evaluation with existing PSO (Particle Swarm Optimisation) and PABFD (Best Fit Decreasing). The performance evaluation of the proposed method is done using power consumption, SLA, CPU utilisation, RAM utilisation, Execution time (ms) and the number of VM migrations. The performance evaluation is done using two simulation scenarios with scaling workload in scenario 1 and increasing resources for the virtual machine to study the performance in underloaded and overloaded conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed HHO algorithm improved execution time(ms) by 4%, had a 27% reduction in power consumption, a 16% reduction in SLA violation and an increase in resource utilisation by 17%.

To research the relationships between intestinal microbes and diseases/health in the ethnic minorities, we collected the microbes of the Han people for comparison. Based on the data, such as age, among the different ethnic groups of the different regions of Sichuan Province, MPPCD not only provided the gut microbial composition but also presented the relative abundance value at the phylum, class, order, family and genus levels in different groups. In addition, differential analysis was performed in different microbes in the two different groups, which contributed to exploring the difference in intestinal microbe structures between the two groups. Meanwhile, a series of related factors, including age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, physical condition, and living altitude, were included in the MPPCD, with special focus on living altitude. To date, this is the first intestinal microbe database to introduce altitude features.

39041358,Development of a cyclic ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry-based collision cross-section database of permethylated human milk oligosaccharides.,"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are an important class of biomolecules responsible for the healthy development of the brain-gut axis of infants. Unfortunately, their accurate characterization is largely precluded due to a variety of reasons - there are over 200 possible HMO structures whereas only 10s of these are available as authentic analytical standards. Furthermore, their isomeric heterogeneity stemming from their many possible glycosidic linkage positions and corresponding α/β anomericities further complicates their analyses. While liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry remains the gold standard for HMO analyses, it often times cannot resolve all possible isomeric species and thus warrants the development of other orthogonal approaches. High-resolution ion mobility spectrometry coupled to mass spectrometry has emerged as a rapid alternative to condensed-phase separations but largely has remained limited to qualitative information related to the resolution of isomers. In this work, we have assessed the use of permethylation to improve both the resolution and sensitivity of HMO analyses with cyclic ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry. In addition to this, we have developed the first-ever high-resolution collision cross-section database for permethylated HMOs using our previously established calibration protocol. We envision that this internal reference database generated from high-resolution cyclic ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry will greatly aid in the accurate characterization of HMOs and provide a valuable, orthogonal, approach to existing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based methods.",False,True,,0.64240223,,hmo,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,5.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Sustainable, affordable, and scalable manufacturing of SF would enable its large-scale use. We report for the first time the high-level secretory production of recombinant SF peptides in engineered Pichia pastoris cell factories and the processing thereof to nanomaterials. Two SF peptides (BmSPR3 and BmSPR4) were synthesized and secreted by P. pastoris using signal peptides and appropriate spacing between hydrophilic sequences. By strain engineering to reduce protein degradation, increase glycyl-tRNA supply, and improve protein secretion, we created the optimized P. pastoris chassis PPGSP-8 to produce BmSPR3 and BmSPR4. The SF fed-batch fermentation titers of the resulting two P. pastoris cell factories were 11.39 and 9.48 g/L, respectively. Protein self-assembly was inhibited by adding Tween 80 to the medium. Recombinant SF peptides were processed to nanoparticles (NPs) and nanofibrils. The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles R3NPs and R4NPs from the recombinant SFs synthesized in P. pastoris cell factories were similar or superior to those of RSFNPs (Regenerated Silk Fibroin NanoParticles) originating from commercially available SF.

Patients at high cardiovascular risk require long-term follow-up for early CVDs detection. Generally, cardiac arrhythmia detection through the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been the basis of many studies. This technique does not provide sufficient information in addition to a high false alarm potential. In addition, the electrodes used to record the ECG signal are not suitable for long-term monitoring. Recently, the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal has attracted great interest among scientists as it provides a non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient source of information related to cardiac activity. In this paper, the PPG signal (online database Physio Net Challenge 2015) is used to classify different cardiac arrhythmias, namely, tachycardia, bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular flutter/fibrillation. The PPG signals are pre-processed and analyzed utilizing various signal-processing techniques to eliminate noise and artifacts, which forms a stage of signal preparation prior to the feature extraction process. A set of 41 PPG features is used for cardiac arrhythmias' classification through the application of four machine-learning techniques, namely, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs), and Ensembles. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction while preserving the most important information in the data. The results show a high-throughput evaluation with an accuracy of 98.4% for the KNN technique with a sensitivity of 98.3%, 95%, 96.8%, and 99.7% for bradycardia, tachycardia, ventricular flutter/fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia, respectively.

39631489,Enhancing suicidal behavior detection in EHRs: A multi-label NLP framework with transformer models and semantic retrieval-based annotation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early identification of suicidal behaviors crucial for clinicians. Current Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches for identifying suicidal behaviors in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) rely on keyword searches, rule-based methods, and binary classification, which may not fully capture the complexity and spectrum of suicidal behaviors. This study aims to create a multi-class labeled dataset with annotation guidelines and develop a novel NLP approach for fine-grained, multi-label classification of suicidal behaviors, improving the efficiency of the annotation process and accuracy of the NLP methods.<h4>Methods</h4>We develop a multi-class labeling system based on guidelines from FDA, CDC, and WHO, distinguishing between six categories of suicidal behaviors and allowing for multiple labels per data sample. To efficiently create an annotated dataset, we use an MPNet-based semantic retrieval framework to extract relevant sentences from a large EHR dataset, reducing annotation space while capturing diverse expressions. Experts annotate the extracted sentences using the multi-class system. We then formulate the task as a multi-label classification problem and fine-tune transformer-based models on the curated dataset to accurately classify suicidal behaviors in EHRs.<h4>Results</h4>Lexical analysis revealed key themes in assessing suicide risk, considering an individual's history, mental health, substance use, and family background. Fine-tuned transformer-based models effectively identified suicidal behaviors from EHRs, with Bio_ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, and XLNet achieving the F1 scores (0.81), outperforming BERT and RoBERTa. The proposed approach, based on a multi-label classification system, captures the complexity of suicidal behaviors effectively particularly ""Suicide Attempt"" and ""Family History"" instances. The proposed approach, using task-specific NLP models and a multi-label classification system, captures the complexity of suicidal behaviors more effectively than traditional binary classification. However, direct comparisons with existing studies are difficult due to varying metrics and label definitions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study presents a robust NLP framework for detecting suicidal behaviors in EHRs, leveraging task-specific fine-tuning of transformer-based models and a semi-automated pipeline. Despite limitations, the approach demonstrates the potential of advanced NLP techniques in enhancing the identification of suicidal behaviors. Future work should focus on model expansion and integration to further improve patient care and clinical decision-making.",False,True,,0.64855874,electronic health records | biobert,mpnet | xlnet,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Enhancing suicidal behavior detection in EHRs,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

To integrate the vast amount of data and information produced by modern metabolomics workflows, we recently developed a sample-centric approach for the semantic enrichment and alignment of metabolomics datasets. The resulting Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG) is queryable and integrates both newly acquired digitalized experimental data and information, and previously reported knowledge. It allows the highlighting of putative bioactive compounds at the extract level by comparing, for example, the occurrence of compounds of a given chemical class with bioactivity results. Using this approach, we recently described potent anti-<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> activity of two rotenoids, deguelin and rotenone. These compounds were identified in six active extracts from four plant species: <i>Cnestis palala</i> (Connaraceae), <i>Chadsia grevei</i>, <i>Pachyrhizus erosus</i>, and <i>Desmodium heterophylum</i> (Fabaceae). In this work, we present the results of the phytochemical investigation of four of these extracts and the establishment of a library of structural analogs for <i>in vitro</i> bioactivity testing. This work led to the isolation, characterization, and biological evaluation of the anti-<i>T. cruzi</i> potential of 41 compounds, including 11 rotenoids and seven compounds reported for the first time. Thanks to modern metabolite annotation and single-step isolation procedures, this work also demonstrates the possibility of considering natural extract libraries as a reservoir of rapidly accessible pure NPs.

36715173,Gene expression databases for physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling of humans and animal species.,"In drug research, developing a sound understanding of the key mechanistic drivers of pharmacokinetics (PK) for new molecular entities is essential for human PK and dose predictions. Here, characterizing the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) processes is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of the drug-target and drug-body interactions. Sufficient knowledge on ADME processes enables reliable interspecies and human PK estimations beyond allometric scaling. The physiologically based PK (PBPK) modeling framework allows the explicit consideration of organ-specific ADME processes. The sum of all passive and active ADME processes results in the observed plasma PK. Gene expression information can be used as surrogate for protein abundance and activity within PBPK models. The absolute and relative expression of ADME genes can differ between species and strains. This is affecting both, the PK and pharmacodynamics and is therefore posing a challenge for the extrapolation from preclinical findings to humans. We developed an automated workflow that generates whole-body gene expression databases for humans and other species relevant in drug development, animal health, nutritional sciences, and toxicology. Solely, bulk RNA-seq data curated and provided by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics from healthy, normal, and untreated primary tissue samples were considered as an unbiased reference of normal gene expression. The databases are interoperable with the Open Systems Pharmacology Suite (PK-Sim and MoBi) and enable seamless access to a central source of curated cross-species gene expression data.

In today's world, recommendation systems based on user preferences assist consumers in making the best decisions without depleting their cognitive resources. They can be applied to a variety of things, including search engines, travel, music, movies, literature, news, gadgets, and dining.

When proposing things, patterns are more discriminative than single phrases. To capture the similarity of the books that the new user had retrieved, the patterns were grouped in a semantically equivalent manner using the Clustering method.

In practice, peak-ground velocities recorded during field operations are used to update the coefficients of a reference GMPE whose variation can be physically interpreted in terms of anelastic attenuation and seismic velocity. We apply the technique to earthquakes recorded at The Geysers geothermal field in Southern California and events occurred in the St. Gallen (Switzerland) geothermal field.

This helps to obtain a simulated activity that reproduces the experimentally recorded neural dynamics as faithfully as possible, and to turn the model into a useful framework for making predictions based on the principles governing the nature of neural cells. In such a context, the access to existing neural models and data outstandingly facilitates the work of computational neuroscientists and fosters its novelty, as the scientific community grows wider and neural models progressively increase in type, size, and number. Nonetheless, even when accessibility is guaranteed, data and models are rarely reused since it is difficult to retrieve, extract and/or understand relevant information and scientists are often required to download and modify individual files, perform neural data analysis, optimize model parameters, and run simulations, on their own and with their own resources. While focusing on the construction of biophysically and morphologically accurate models of hippocampal cells, we have created an online resource, the Build section of the Hippocampus Hub -a scientific portal for research on the hippocampus- that gathers data and models from different online open repositories and allows their collection as the first step of a single cell model building workflow. Interoperability of tools and data is the key feature of the work we are presenting.

This module delivers learning materials introducing the utility of the BASH (Bourne Again Shell) programming language for genomic data analysis in an interactive format that uses appropriate cloud resources for data access and analyses. The next-generation sequencing revolution has generated massive amounts of novel biological data from a multitude of platforms that survey an ever-growing list of genomic modalities. These data require significant downstream computational and statistical analyses to glean meaningful biological insights. However, the skill sets required to generate these data are vastly different from the skills required to analyze these data. Bench scientists that generate next-generation data often lack the training required to perform analysis of these datasets and require support from bioinformatics specialists. Dedicated computational training is required to empower biologists in the area of genomic data analysis, however, learning to efficiently leverage a command line interface is a significant barrier in learning how to leverage common analytical tools. Cloud platforms have the potential to democratize access to the technical tools and computational resources necessary to work with modern sequencing data, providing an effective framework for bioinformatics education. This module aims to provide an interactive platform that slowly builds technical skills and knowledge needed to interact with genomics data on the command line in the Cloud.

The selection of a lattice topology is critical in maximizing the value of the lattice structure and its unique properties for the intended application. To support this, we have compiled a catalog of lattice structures from the literature that includes all Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) for which a low-order Fourier series fit is known (so that they can be modeled and manufactured). We also include equations that do not directly correspond to known TPMS but do produce a triply periodic structure without sharp corners that would give rise to stress concentrations.

The investigation and analysis of these substances in the body fluids play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of various diseases. Therefore, it is important to accurately separate the required substances, and several techniques are developed to be used for this purpose. We have developed a lab-on-a-disc type of device and platform named CD-PRIME. This device is automated and has good results for sample contamination and sample stability. Moreover, it has advantages of a good acquisition yield, a short operation time, and high reproducibility. In addition, depending on the type of disc to be mounted, plasma containing cell-free DNA, circulating tumor cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or buffy coats can be separated.

40369051,Multiple deception resources deployment strategy based on reinforcement learning for network threat mitigation.,"The Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) poses significant security challenges to the availability and reliability of government and enterprise information systems. Due to the high concealment and long duration characteristic of APT, industry and academia typically adopt active defense methods to combat APT. By deploying deception defense (DD) methods such as honeypots, the attacker's target can be effectively confused. However, in reality, honeypots are usually deployed in resource-constrained systems. Therefore, how to effectively deploy deception resources is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. This paper proposes a multi-type deception resources deployment strategy generation algorithm based on reinforcement learning for the network reconnaissance stage of APT. Through the analysis of network assets and attack process, the algorithm balances the two dimensions of defense effectiveness and defense cost, generating the deployment strategy for deception resources. The experimental results show that compared to other baselines, the proposed algorithm achieves defensive success probability of 97.09% while reducing the attack probability of the target asset by at least 10.34%. This effectively reduces defense costs while ensuring defense efficiency. In addition, the algorithm demonstrates good convergence and stability.",False,True,,0.6304604,advanced persistent threat,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1

36224012,Research Trends in the Application of Artificial Intelligence in Oncology: A Bibliometric and Network Visualization Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The past decade has seen major advances in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to solve various biomedical problems, including cancer. This has resulted in more than 6000 scientific papers focusing on AI in oncology alone. The expansiveness of this research area presents a challenge to those seeking to understand how it has developed. A scientific analysis of AI in the oncology literature is therefore crucial for understanding its overall structure and development. This may be addressed through bibliometric analysis, which employs computational and visual tools to identify research activity, relationships, and expertise within large collections of bibliographic data. There is already a large volume of research data regarding the development of AI applications in cancer research. However, there is no published bibliometric analysis of this topic that offers comprehensive insights into publication growth, co-citation networks, research collaboration, and keyword co-occurrence analysis for technological trends involving AI across the entire spectrum of oncology research. The purpose of this study is to investigate documents published during the last decade using bibliometric indicators and network visualization. This will provide a detailed assessment of global research activities, key themes, and AI trends over the entire breadth of the oncology field. It will also specifically highlight top-performing authors, organizations, and nations that have made major contributions to this research domain, as well as their interactions via network collaboration maps and betweenness centrality metric. This study represents the first global investigation of AI covering the entire cancer field and using several validated bibliometric techniques. It should provide valuable reference material for reorienting this field and for identifying research trajectories, topics, major publications, and influential entities including scholars, institutions, and countries. It will also identify international collaborations at three levels: micro (that of an individual researcher), meso (that of an institution), and macro (that of a country), in order to inform future lines of research.<h4>Methods</h4>The Science Citation Index Expanded from the Web of Science Core Collection was searched for articles and reviews pertaining exclusively to AI in cancer from 2012 through 2022. Annual publication trends were plotted using Microsoft Excel 2019. CiteSpace and VOSViewer were used to investigate the most productive countries, researchers, journals, as well as the sharing of resources, intellectual property, and knowledge base in this field, along with the co-citation analysis of references and keywords.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 6757 documents were retrieved. China produced the most publications of any country (2087, 30.89%), and Sun Yat Sen University the highest number (167, 2.47%) of any institute. WEI WANG was the most prolific author (33, 0.49%).

39795895,Click Chemistry as an Efficient Toolbox for Coupling Sterically Hindered Molecular Systems to Obtain Advanced Materials for Nanomedicine.,"Since its conceptualization, click chemistry in all its variants has proven to be a superior synthesis protocol, compared to conventional methods, for forming new covalent bonds under mild conditions, orthogonally, and with high yields. If a term like reactive resilience could be established, click reactions would be good examples, as they perform better under increasingly challenging conditions. Particularly, highly hindered couplings that perform poorly with conventional chemistry protocols-such as those used to conjugate biomacromolecules (e.g., proteins and aptamers) or multiple drugs onto macromolecular platforms-can be more easily achieved using click chemistry principles, while also promoting high stereoselectivity in the products. In this review, three molecular platforms relevant in the field of nanomedicine are considered: polymers/copolymers, cyclodextrins, and fullerenes, whose functionalization poses a challenge due to steric hindrance, either from the intrinsic bulk behavior (as in polymers) or from the proximity of confined reactive sites, as seen in cyclodextrins and fullerenes. Their functionalization with biologically active groups (drugs or biomolecules), primarily through copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) and thiol-ene click reactions, has led to the development of increasingly sophisticated systems with enhanced specificity, multifunctionality, bioavailability, delayed clearance, multi-targeting, selective cytotoxicity, and tracking capabilities-all essential in the field of nanomedicine.",False,True,,0.655999,,cuaac | spaac,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

However, the due to the dispersal of the data into several different databases, the utilization of these resources is limited. Here, our aim was to establish a platform enabling the validation of chemoresistance-associated genes and the ranking of available cell line models.<h4>Methods</h4>We processed four independent databases, DepMap, GDSC1, GDSC2, and CTRP. The gene expression data was quantile normalized and HUGO gene names were assigned to have unambiguous identification of the genes. Resistance values were exported for all agents. The correlation between gene expression and therapy resistance is computed using ROC test.<h4>Results</h4>We combined four datasets with chemosensitivity data of 1562 agents and transcriptome-level gene expression of 1250 cancer cell lines.

On retrospective experiments from previous large-scale screens, BATCHIE designs rapidly discover highly effective and synergistic combinations. In a prospective combination screen of a library of 206 drugs on a collection of pediatric cancer cell lines, the BATCHIE model accurately predicts unseen combinations and detects synergies after exploring only 4% of the 1.4M possible experiments. Further, the model identifies a panel of top combinations for Ewing sarcomas, which follow-up validation experiments confirm to be effective, including the rational and translatable top hit of PARP plus topoisomerase I inhibition.

Internet of Things (IoT) technology is an advanced technique that is quickly increasing owing to the development of a network of organized online devices. In today's digital era, the IoT is considered one of the most robust technologies. However, attackers can effortlessly hack the IoT devices employed to generate botnets, and it is applied to present distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks beside networks. The DDoS attack is the foremost attack on the system that causes the complete network to go down. Thus, average consumers may need help to get the services they need from the server. The compromised or attackers IoT devices want to be perceived well in the system. So, presently, Deep Learning (DL) plays a prominent part in forecasting end-users' behaviour by extracting features and identifying the adversary in the network. This paper proposes a Synergistic Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution with Graph Convolutional Network Cyberattack Detection and Mitigation (SSODE-GCNDM) technique in the IoT environment. The main intention of the SSODE-GCNDM method is to recognize the presence of DDoS attack behaviour in IoT platforms. Primarily, the SSODE-GCNDM technique utilizes Z-score normalization to scale the input data into a uniform format. The presented SSODE-GCNDM approach utilizes synergistic swarm optimization with a differential evolution (SSO-DE) approach for the feature selection. Moreover, the graph convolutional network (GCN) method recognizes and mitigates attacks. Finally, the presented SSODE-GCNDM technique implements the northern goshawk optimization (NGO) method to fine-tune the hyperparameters involved in the GCN method. An extensive range of experimentation analyses occur, and the outcomes are observed using numerous features.

38075858,A toolbox of machine learning software to support microbiome analysis.,"The human microbiome has become an area of intense research due to its potential impact on human health. However, the analysis and interpretation of this data have proven to be challenging due to its complexity and high dimensionality. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can process vast amounts of data to uncover informative patterns and relationships within the data, even with limited prior knowledge. Therefore, there has been a rapid growth in the development of software specifically designed for the analysis and interpretation of microbiome data using ML techniques. These software incorporate a wide range of ML algorithms for clustering, classification, regression, or feature selection, to identify microbial patterns and relationships within the data and generate predictive models. This rapid development with a constant need for new developments and integration of new features require efforts into compile, catalog and classify these tools to create infrastructures and services with easy, transparent, and trustable standards.

This platform is based on cellular extracts derived from genomically recoded Escherichia coli lacking release factor 1 and enhanced through deletion of endonuclease A.

Due to their reliance on assumptions, traditional rotor angle stability methodologies frequently fail in online transient stability testing. MGM successfully captures the dynamic behavior of microgrids by approximating state variables using a sequence of polynomials and coefficients. Redundant data, like as vibrations or noise signals, can cause delays in defect diagnosis and decrease diagnostic accuracy. This problem is addressed by integrating RFID technology. RFID technology could potentially be used with a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to develop a sophisticated fault diagnostic system. This entails identifying fault characteristics through the use of signal processing techniques and feature extraction methods, such as the Fourier transform and time-domain statistical features. In addition, we use Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) to reduce superfluous data. The suggested techniques significantly increase fault detection efficiency and precision, outperforming existing techniques with a 0.94 classification accuracy.

To further simplify the detection process, the BPE structure was designed as three separate units: anode ECL collection, cathode catalytic amplification, and intermediate functional sensing units. Specifically, the anode unit was placed with Eosin Yellow, a cheap and effective ECL reagent, and the cathode unit was a laser-induced polyoxometalate-graphene electrode, which was helpful to enhance the anode ECL signal. The intermediate functional sensing unit consisted of a temperature-sensitive conductive film. Further, using a carbon nano-onion nanocomposite with excellent absorption performance in the near-infrared region as a signal tag not only leads to changes in the electrical conductivity of the film through heat transfer and thus affects the ECL signal but also produces a strong PA response.

38469223,Fossil Collection at the Zoology Museum of the University of Concepción: enhancing understanding of Chile's past biodiversity.,"<h4>Background</h4>The digital inventory of paleontological material stored in Chilean museums is highly relevant as it increases accessibility to information, both locally and over long distances, while reducing wear and tear on specimens caused by physical manipulation. The Fossil Collection database of the Museum of Zoology of the University of Concepción (UCC_MZUC_FOS) includes 144 records, with the main representatives being marine invertebrates of the Bivalvia, Echinoidea and Gastropoda classes. Notable species include <i>Encopecalderensis</i>, <i>Hemiasterwayensis</i>, <i>Zygochlamyspatagonica</i> and <i>Retrotapesexalbidus</i>, most of which come from important Chilean fossil sites. Material was collected between 1970 and 2017, with a large portion of it being donated and identified by Professor Emeritus Hugo I. Moyano and Dr. Alberto Larraín. Although the specimens contained in the resource offer basic collecting information, they substantially contribute to sharing knowledge on the fossils kept in the museums throughout the country, while providing data on their distribution.<h4>New information</h4>This resource corresponds to the first publication of data on faunal fossils from a museum collection in Chile on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) platform, thereby enhancing the understanding and documentation of Chile's paleontological heritage and its national biodiversity.",False,True,,0.6392862,fossil collection database of the museum of zoology of the university of concepción | global biodiversity information facility,gbif,6.0,conflict,gbif | global biodiversity information facility,,,spacy,0.0,Fossil Collection at the Zoology Museum of the University of Concepción,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37731974,"Development of genomic resources for Rhodes grass (<i>Chloris gayana</i>), draft genome and annotated variant discovery.","Genomic resources for grasses, especially warm-season grasses are limited despite their commercial and environmental importance. Here, we report the first annotated draft whole genome sequence for diploid Rhodes grass (<i>Chloris gayana</i>), a tropical C4 species. Generated using long read nanopore sequencing and assembled using the Flye software package, the assembled genome is 603 Mbp in size and comprises 5,233 fragments that were annotated using the GenSas pipeline. The annotated genome has 46,087 predicted genes corresponding to 92.0% of the expected genomic content present via BUSCO analysis. Gene ontology terms and repetitive elements are identified and discussed. An additional 94 individual plant genotypes originating from three diploid and two tetraploid Rhodes grass cultivars were short-read whole genome resequenced (WGR) to generate a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resource for the species that can be used to elucidate inter- and intra-cultivar relationships across both ploidy levels. A total of 75,777 high quality SNPs were used to generate a phylogenetic tree, highlighting the diversity present within the cultivars which agreed with the known breeding history. Differentiation was observed between diploid and tetraploid cultivars. The WGR data were also used to provide insights into the nature and evolution of the tetraploid status of the species, with results largely agreeing with the published literature that the tetraploids are autotetraploid.",False,True,,0.67601335,,gensas,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,3.0,False,False,,,False,,1
39812750,Pan-cancer secreted proteome and skeletal muscle regulation: insight from a proteogenomic data-driven knowledge base.,"Large-scale, pan-cancer analysis is enabled by data driven knowledge bases that link tumor molecular profiles with phenotypes. A debilitating cancer-related phenotype is skeletal muscle loss, or cachexia, which occurs partly from tumor products secreted into circulation. Using the LinkedOmicsKB knowledge base assembled from the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium proteogenomic analysis, along with catalogs of human secretome proteins, ligand-receptor pairs and molecular signatures, we sought to identify candidate pan-cancer proteins secreted to blood that could regulate skeletal muscle phenotypes in multiple solid cancers. Tumor proteins having significant pan-cancer associations with muscle were referenced against secretome proteins secreted to blood from the Human Protein Atlas, then verified as increased in paired tumor vs. normal tissues in pan-cancer manner. This workflow revealed seven secreted proteins from cancers afflicting kidneys, head and neck, lungs and pancreas that classified as protein-binding activity modulator, extracellular matrix protein or intercellular signaling molecule. Concordance of these biomarkers with validated molecular signatures of cachexia and senescence supported relevance to muscle and cachexia disease biology, and high tumor expression of the biomarker set associated with lower overall survival. In this article, we discuss avenues by which skeletal muscle and cachexia may be regulated by these candidate pan-cancer proteins secreted to blood, and conceptualize a strategy that considers them collectively as a biomarker signature with potential for refinement by data analytics and radiogenomics for predictive testing of future risk in a non-invasive, blood-based panel amenable to broad uptake and early management.",False,True,,0.6139303,linkedomicskb | human protein atlas,,6.0,conflict,,,,spacy,0.0,Pan-cancer secreted proteome and skeletal muscle regulation,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying sarcopenia has major implications for understanding human ageing<sup>2</sup>. Yet, progress has been slow, partly due to the difficulties of characterizing skeletal muscle niche heterogeneity (whereby myofibres are the most abundant) and obtaining well-characterized human samples<sup>3,4</sup>. Here we generate a single-cell/single-nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility map of human limb skeletal muscles encompassing over 387,000 cells/nuclei from individuals aged 15 to 99 years with distinct fitness and frailty levels. We describe how cell populations change during ageing, including the emergence of new populations in older people, and the cell-specific and multicellular network features (at the transcriptomic and epigenetic levels) associated with these changes. On the basis of cross-comparison with genetic data, we also identify key elements of chromatin architecture that mark susceptibility to sarcopenia.

36896468,An extensible vector toolkit and parts library for advanced engineering of plant genomes.,"Plant biotechnology is rife with new advances in transformation and genome engineering techniques. A common requirement for delivery and coordinated expression in plant cells, however, places the design and assembly of transformation constructs at a crucial juncture as desired reagent suites grow more complex. Modular cloning principles have simplified some aspects of vector design, yet many important components remain unavailable or poorly adapted for rapid implementation in biotechnology research. Here, we describe a universal Golden Gate cloning toolkit for vector construction. The toolkit chassis is compatible with the widely accepted Phytobrick standard for genetic parts, and supports assembly of arbitrarily complex T-DNAs through improved capacity, positional flexibility, and extensibility in comparison to extant kits. We also provision a substantial library of newly adapted Phytobricks, including regulatory elements for monocot and dicot gene expression, and coding sequences for genes of interest such as reporters, developmental regulators, and site-specific recombinases. Finally, we use a series of dual-luciferase assays to measure contributions to expression from promoters, terminators, and from cross-cassette interactions attributable to enhancer elements in certain promoters. Taken together, these publicly available cloning resources can greatly accelerate the testing and deployment of new tools for plant engineering.",False,True,,0.7170926,,t-dnas,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1
37289767,Knowledge-enhanced prototypical network with class cluster loss for few-shot relation classification.,"Few-shot Relation Classification identifies the relation between target entity pairs in unstructured natural language texts by training on a small number of labeled samples. Recent prototype network-based studies have focused on enhancing the prototype representation capability of models by incorporating external knowledge. However, the majority of these works constrain the representation of class prototypes implicitly through complex network structures, such as multi-attention mechanisms, graph neural networks, and contrastive learning, which constrict the model's ability to generalize. In addition, most models with triplet loss disregard intra-class compactness during model training, thereby limiting the model's ability to handle outlier samples with low semantic similarity. Therefore, this paper proposes a non-weighted prototype enhancement module that uses the feature-level similarity between prototypes and relation information as a gate to filter and complete features. Meanwhile, we design a class cluster loss that samples difficult positive and negative samples and explicitly constrains both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability to learn a metric space with high discriminability. Extensive experiments were done on the publicly available dataset FewRel 1.0 and 2.0, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.",False,True,,0.6817183,,fewrel,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,,,False,,1

This review presents a summary of the recent advancements in ML-assisted mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data analysis to establish the chemical structures of NPs. First, ML-based MS/MS analyses that rely on library matching are discussed, which involves the utilization of ML algorithms to calculate similarity, predict the MS/MS fragments, and form molecular fingerprint. Then, ML assisted MS/MS structural annotation without library matching is reviewed. Furthermore, the cases of ML algorithms in assisting structural studies of NPs based on NMR are discussed from four perspectives: NMR prediction, functional group identification, structural categorization and quantum chemical calculation.

38600587,An integrated toolkit for human microglia functional genomics.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, play vital roles in brain development, and disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human iPSC-derived microglia (iMG) provide a promising model to study these processes. However, existing iMG generation protocols face challenges, such as prolonged differentiation time, lack of detailed characterization, and limited gene function investigation via CRISPR-Cas9.<h4>Methods</h4>Our integrated toolkit for in-vitro microglia functional genomics optimizes iPSC differentiation into iMG through a streamlined two-step, 20-day process, producing iMG with a normal karyotype. We confirmed the iMG's authenticity and quality through single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility profiles (ATAC-Seq), proteomics and functional tests. The toolkit also incorporates a drug-dependent CRISPR-ON/OFF system for temporally controlled gene expression. Further, we facilitate the use of multi-omic data by providing online searchable platform that compares new iMG profiles to human primary microglia: https://sherlab.shinyapps.io/IPSC-derived-Microglia/ .<h4>Results</h4>Our method generates iMG that closely align with human primary microglia in terms of transcriptomic, proteomic, and chromatin accessibility profiles. Functionally, these iMG exhibit Ca2 + transients, cytokine driven migration, immune responses to inflammatory signals, and active phagocytosis of CNS related substrates including synaptosomes, amyloid beta and myelin. Significantly, the toolkit facilitates repeated iMG harvesting, essential for large-scale experiments like CRISPR-Cas9 screens. The standalone ATAC-Seq profiles of our iMG closely resemble primary microglia, positioning them as ideal tools to study AD-associated single nucleotide variants (SNV) especially in the genome regulatory regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our advanced two-step protocol rapidly and efficiently produces authentic iMG. With features like the CRISPR-ON/OFF system and a comprehensive multi-omic data platform, our toolkit equips researchers for robust microglial functional genomic studies. By facilitating detailed SNV investigation and offering a sustainable cell harvest mechanism, the toolkit heralds significant progress in neurodegenerative disease drug research and therapeutic advancement.",False,True,,0.6895748,,img,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,,False,0.0,False,False,https://sherlab.shinyapps.io/IPSC-derived-Microglia/,https://sherlab.shinyapps.io/IPSC-derived-Microglia/,True,...ares new iMG profiles to human primary microglia: https://sherlab.shinyapps.io/IPSC-derived-Microglia/ .<h4>Results</h4>Our method generates iMG that cl...,1

38109119,Seminar: Scalable Preprocessing Tools for Exposomic Data Analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>The exposome serves as a popular framework in which to study exposures from chemical and nonchemical stressors across the life course and the differing roles that these exposures can play in human health. As a result, data relevant to the exposome have been used as a resource in the quest to untangle complicated health trajectories and help connect the dots from exposures to adverse outcome pathways.<h4>Objectives</h4>The primary aim of this methods seminar is to clarify and review preprocessing techniques critical for accurate and effective external exposomic data analysis. Scalability is emphasized through an application of highly innovative combinatorial techniques coupled with more traditional statistical strategies. The Public Health Exposome is used as an archetypical model. The novelty and innovation of this seminar's focus stem from its methodical, comprehensive treatment of preprocessing and its demonstration of the positive effects preprocessing can have on downstream analytics.<h4>Discussion</h4>State-of-the-art technologies are described for data harmonization and to mitigate noise, which can stymie downstream interpretation, and to select key exposomic features, without which analytics may lose focus. A main task is the reduction of multicollinearity, a particularly formidable problem that frequently arises from repeated measurements of similar events taken at various times and from multiple sources. Empirical results highlight the effectiveness of a carefully planned preprocessing workflow as demonstrated in the context of more highly concentrated variable lists, improved correlational distributions, and enhanced downstream analytics for latent relationship discovery. The nascent field of exposome science can be characterized by the need to analyze and interpret a complex confluence of highly inhomogeneous spatial and temporal data, which may present formidable challenges to even the most powerful analytical tools. A systematic approach to preprocessing can therefore provide an essential first step in the application of modern computer and data science methods. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12901.",False,True,,0.6774646,public health exposome,,6.0,ok,,,,spacy,0.0,Seminar,False,0.0,False,False,https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12901,,False,,1
37748672,Bio-mitigation of organic pollutants using horseradish peroxidase as a promising biocatalytic platform for environmental sustainability.,"A wide array of environmental pollutants is often generated and released into the ecosystem from industrial and human activities. Antibiotics, phenolic compounds, hydroquinone, industrial dyes, and Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) are prevalent pollutants in water matrices. To promote environmental sustainability and minimize the impact of these pollutants, it is essential to eliminate such contaminants. Although there are multiple methods for pollutants removal, many of them are inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been widely explored for its ability to oxidize the aforementioned pollutants, both alone and in combination with other peroxidases, and in an immobilized way. Numerous positive attributes make HRP an excellent biocatalyst in the biodegradation of diverse environmentally hazardous pollutants. In the present review, we underlined the major advancements in the HRP for environmental research.

38794438,What Was George Forrest's Plant Collection Journey like in China?,"Since the 16th century, Western countries have conducted extensive plant collections in Asia, particularly in China, driven by the need to collect botanical resources and foster academic development. These activities have not only significantly enriched the Western botanical specimen collections but have also had a profound impact on the development of related disciplines such as botany, ecology, and horticulture. During this process, a large number of renowned plant hunters emerged, whose discoveries and contributions are still remembered today. George Forrest (1873-1932) was one of these distinguished plant hunters. From 1904 to 1932, he visited China seven times to collect plants and became famous for the regional distinctiveness of the species he collected. However, due to the lack of systematic collection, organization, and analysis of specimens collected by Forrest, only a few species, such as the species <i>Rhododendron</i>, are well-known among the many species he introduced to the West. Furthermore, the personal collecting characteristics and the characteristic species collected by Forrest are also not clear. This limits a comprehensive understanding of the specimen collection history and impact of Forrest in China. Therefore, systematic organization and analysis of Forrest's plant specimens collected in China are crucial to understanding his impact on botanical classification, <i>Rhododendrons</i> introduction, global horticulture, and plant propagation. This study aims to systematically organize and analyze the plant specimens collected by George Forrest in China to investigate the family, genus, and species composition of the collected specimens and the seven collection expeditions of Forrest in China, as well as the time and altitude of these collections. Furthermore, it seeks to discuss Forrest's scientific contributions to the global spread of plants, the widespread application of the <i>Rhododendron</i>, and his impact on the development of modern gardens, providing a theoretical basis and data reference for related research and professional development. To this end, we extensively consulted important historical literature related to Forrest and systematically collected data from online specimen databases. The conclusions drawn from the available data include 38,603 specimens, with 26,079 collection numbers, belonging to 233 families, 1395 genera, and 5426 species, which account for 48.24%, 32.63%, and 14.17% of the plant families, genera, and species in China, respectively. <i>Rhododendron</i> specimens made up 17.20% of the specimens collected in this study. The collection locations cover three provinces or autonomous regions, 11 prefecture-level cities, and 25 counties. Furthermore, we found that Forrest's collections were concentrated in spring and summer, mainly in high-altitude areas, with 135 species found below 1500 m and 3754 species at 1500 m and above. <i>Rhododendron</i> specimens were mostly found above 3000 m.",False,True,,0.62392974,what was george forrest's plant collection journey like in china? since the 16th century,,1.0,low_score,,,,spacy,0.0,,True,1.0,False,False,,,False,,1
